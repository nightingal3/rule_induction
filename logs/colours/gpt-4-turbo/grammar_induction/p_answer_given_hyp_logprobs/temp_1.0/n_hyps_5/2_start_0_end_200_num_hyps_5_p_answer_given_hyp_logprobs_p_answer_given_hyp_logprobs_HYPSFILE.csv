"To determine what ""dax"" means, let's analyze the recurring patterns between the input and output.

Consider the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" and its corresponding output ""blue blue blue green red blue red"":
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The word ""walm"" seems to appear before a color changes, potentially indicating ""walm"" corresponds to changing the color, leading to ""blue"" before ""green"" and ""red"" before ""blue.""

Now consider the input ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" and its output ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"":
- The word ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red,"" as seen directly after ""dax.""
- The word ""walm"" appears before a color shift, reinforcing our above observation.
- The word ""zup"" directly correlates to a transition to the color ""yellow.""

Considering ""dax zup dax walm"":
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" and after it, repeating colors of ""green"" follow.
- ""walm"" seems to set the next word (""dax"") to produce a run of ""green.""

""Input: wif dax"":
- ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and directly after it, ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""

""Input: zup lug wif dax lug"":
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the ""dax"" following ""wif"" translates to ""green,"" same as in the previous examples.

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, whenever ""dax"" appears, it consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the preceding word. Also, ""dax"" does not seem to affect the following word's color, which means its meaning is independent and doesn't affect other elements in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-2.917317369076,0,dax
"To deduce what ""dax"" means, I will analyze the examples provided and look for patterns related to the position and occurrence of ""dax"" and its associated output color. 

In the first example, ""dax"" follows ""lug walm"" and precedes ""wif."" Similarly, in the second example, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" and ""walm lug."" In the third example, ""dax"" appears first followed by ""zup"" and again ""dax"" followed by ""walm."" In the fourth example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif."" Finally, in the last example, ""dax"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug.""

Let's extract the color associated with ""dax"" in every instance:

1. When ""lug walm dax wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
2. When ""dax wif walm lug"" translates to ""green red red red,"" the first ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. When ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green,"" both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green.""
4. When ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
5. When ""zup lug wif dax lug"" translates to ""yellow blue red green blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, it appears that regardless of its position or the words around it, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" There doesn't seem to be any variation or further complexity in the samples provided.

Hence, the rule can be simplified as:

Rule: dax -> green",-6.28909888242,0,dax
"Based on the provided examples, it's possible to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs and looking for patterns.

Let's look at the first example:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Analyzing this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"". ""dax"" appears once and the output at the same position is ""green"". We can't be sure yet, but ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"".

Now, consider the second example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here ""dax"" appears at the start and the corresponding output is ""green"", supporting the earlier hypothesis. 

The third example is:
Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" two times, and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" after ""dax"" has been used. ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

The fourth example:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green

This also supports that ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""dax"" means ""green"".

Finally, the fifth example:
Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Again, consistent with the previous patterns ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Based on these observations, it seems that each nonce word has a corresponding color and that ""dax"" consistently matches with ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
",-9.802128938387,0,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the relationship between the input and the output sequences to see under what conditions ""dax"" appears and what colors are output when it does.

In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green"" and then ""red."" However, later in the same input, without ""dax,"" ""wif"" on its own corresponds to ""blue."" This suggests that ""dax"" has an impact on the output color following it, changing the output for ""wif"" from blue to red.

In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" again, and the output is ""green"" and ""red,"" consistent with the first input. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output is ""green"" and ""yellow,"" and we know from the fifth example that ""zup"" typically results in yellow. This suggests that ""dax"" does not alter the expected color of ""zup"" but does precede it with ""green.""

In the third input, ""dax"" is followed again by ""zup"" resulting in ""green"" and ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" with the result being ""green"" and ""green."" The color green is again associated with ""dax,"" and this example does not conflict with the previous interpretation.

In the fourth input, ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" and the output is ""green"" and ""red,"" which is consistent with what we've seen before.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green"" and ""blue."" Since ""lug"" by itself also corresponds to ""blue"" in other examples, this suggests that ""dax"" followed by ""lug"" produces ""green"" and does not change the blue result for ""lug.""

From the consistency across examples, it seems that ""dax"" always results in ""green."" Also, when ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" ""wif"" transitions from its normal output ""blue"" to ""red."" For other words following ""dax,"" the normal output color seems to remain the same except that it is preceded by ""green.""

With these observations, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:
Rule: ""dax"" precedes any color output with ""green."" When followed by ""wif,"" it changes the output color for ""wif"" from blue to red. For other words, the usual color follows the green without change.",-10.49070206328,0,dax
"Rule: From the given examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" 

dax -> green",-12.67210612074,0,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the word ""wif"" and its resultant output color. Let's break it down example by example:

1. ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"". Here, ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" itself gives ""red"".

2. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" translates to ""green green green red blue green green green"". In this sequence, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""wif"" by itself translates to ""red"".

4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" translates to ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". In this case, ""wif"" appears after ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") and before ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), and ""wif"" itself still translates to ""red"".

5. ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"". Here ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" and it still corresponds to ""red.""

Combining these observations leads to the straightforward rule:

Rule: wif -> red

- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" (it seems to maintain a consistent output despite the presence of other words).

2. In ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""bluf"" is output as ""red,"" the same as ""wif"" which comes before it.

- In the first example, ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Since ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and has three letters, ""walm"" causes the word ""yellow"" to be repeated three times before continuing with the pattern for ""wif"".
  
- In the second example, ""wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""red green yellow yellow yellow"". The pattern follows each word's color until ""walm"", which follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times, because ""zup"" has three letters.
  
- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" correlates with blue and has three letters, so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
  
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"". The first ""walm"" after ""zup"" repeats ""yellow"" three times, and the second occurrence of ""walm"" isn't present, indicating it might be an error in the example or a rule that if ""walm"" comes at the end, it's not applied.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us analyze its occurrence and the corresponding output color patterns:

1. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" might map to ""yellow,"" as it precedes two yellow colors.
   - ""wif"" at the end corresponds to the single red color that follows.

2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" initially maps to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" reinforcing the assumptions from the first line.
   - Since ""zup"" comes before two yellow colors, it further confirms the mapping of ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" occurs at the end, following three yellow colors.

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" aligning with previous assumptions.
   - ""lug"" could map to ""blue,"" as it comes before three blue colors.
   - ""walm"" comes after blue tints.

4. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - The sequence confirms ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red.
   - ""walm"" is in between yellows and greens.

5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
   - Again, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" ends with ""red,"" and ""zup"" terminates with ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" is bracketed by ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red).

From the patterns, it is clear that ""walm"" doesn't correspond to a single color. Instead, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that is immediately preceding it:

- In (1) and (5), after ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, the output is multiple yellows.
- In (2) and (4), after ""zup"" (yellow), the output is again multiple yellows.
- In (3), after ""lug"" (blue), the output is multiple blues.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates to green
   - ""wif"" correlates to red
   - ""walm"" first follows with multiple greens (aligning with ""dax"") and then later with multiple reds (after ""wif"" and before ""zup"" which is yellow).

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the previous word a variable number of times before changing to the color output of the next word. ""Walm"" does not have a fixed color but instead takes on the characteristic of repetition or a continuation for the previously mentioned color.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color output of the previous word in the sequence, until a new word is introduced that would change the color output.

- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green",-5.117853089910999,1,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll examine the examples provided and look for patterns:

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf 
   Output: red green yellow red green green

2. Input: dax wif walm 
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: zup dax 
   Output: yellow green

4. Input: dax bluf zup 
   Output: green green yellow

5. Input: dax wif lug 
   Output: green red blue

By analyzing where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output, it becomes clear that the output color for ""dax"" is consistently ""green"". No matter what the position of ""dax"" is in the input, the output for it is always ""green"".

Given this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-7.6259172995119995,1,dax
dax -> green,-9.49543053376,1,dax
"Analyzing the inputs and outputs given:

- In example 1, ""wif lug dax"" corresponds to ""red blue green"", and ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"". Since ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"", respectively, it suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In example 2, ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red"". If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and assuming that ""walm"" follows the same pattern (which we later see in example 4), then ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red"".
  
- In example 3, ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red"". With ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"".

- In example 4, ""lug walm wif lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue red blue"". Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and based on the previous examples, ""wif"" must correspond to ""red"". ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it in this sequence.
  
- In example 5, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"". Since there is no previous word for ""walm"" to take the color of, it's reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these examples, it can be deduced that:

5. When ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup lug"" or ""lug zup"", the output is ""yellow blue"" or ""blue yellow"" respectively, but this is the same as the output for each of those words individually.

From this, we can conclude that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word directly before it, implying that ""bluf"" means to repeat the previous color. This rule can be represented as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color of the word before bluf

For instance:

- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" (repeat the color ""red"" that corresponds to ""wif"").

  Here, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

- Example 2: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Rule: walm -> output three yellows.",-6.858288330543999,1,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the introduction of the nonce word ""walm"" adds a repetition of the color expressed in the previous word. The color word is immediately followed by additional instances of its corresponding color output.

Here's the breakdown according to your examples:

Example 1:
- ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", it results in additional ""yellow"" outputs.

Example 2:
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""bluf"" is associated with ""red"".
- Even when ""walm"" is followed by other words like ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), it causes a repeat of the previous color until a new color word appears.

Example 3, 4 & 5:
- Consistently, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color stated before it, up until a new color word (""lug"", ""dax"", ""wif"") appears.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeats the output color of the word prior to it until a new color word is introduced.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, repeat the color associated with the previous word repeated any number of times (at least once) until a different color-associated word appears.",-7.1138495413800005,1,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs with their respective outputs to identify any patterns. 

Let's examine the given examples:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Noting that 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'blue', but no direct correspondence for 'walm' is seen since it directly precedes the repetition of 'yellow'. The sequence after 'walm' seems to follow the color that precedes it.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here again, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue', 'dax' to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', and 'bluf' once again to 'red'. After 'walm', the pattern of 'yellow' continues until a new word 'dax' appears, which has its own color 'green'.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   We see 'zup' as 'yellow', 'wif' as 'red', and 'lug' as 'blue'. After 'walm', 'red' is repeated before 'lug' introduces 'blue'. 

4. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   'Dax' leads to 'green', 'wif' to 'red', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'zup' to 'yellow'. After 'walm', the color 'red' is repeated just like in the previous example.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Here 'zup' is 'yellow' and after 'walm', 'yellow' is repeated.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The repetition continues until a new word (associated with a different color) appears. If there are no new words following 'walm', the last color before 'walm' is simply repeated (as seen in the last example).

Rule: walm -> triggers repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> triggers repetition of the preceding color.",-9.551362108378001,1,walm

2. The repetition of ""yellow"" occurs directly after the word ""zup"" whenever ""walm"" is present.
3. Regardless of what comes before ""walm"", if ""zup"" is present, it is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" after ""walm"" is used.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" induces a rule which is to repeat the color associated with ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", three times immediately after the occurrence of ""zup"". Therefore, it does not matter what comes before or after ""walm"", the rule applies specifically to the sequence that follows ""zup"".

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also translates to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the corresponding output is green.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the corresponding output is red.
3. When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the corresponding output is green.

However, we do not have instances where ""bluf"" stands alone or is followed by ""wif,"" so we cannot induce a specific rule without a word following ""bluf"" that isn't ""dax"" or ""lug.""

Taking these patterns into account, we can suggest a potential rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word that either precedes or follows it with an exception when ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" it always results in green.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in each given example that correspond to the given outputs.

   Output: green green red yellow

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

3. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue

4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

5. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue

Comparing the inputs and outputs:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In all examples, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" where it appears (examples 1 and 2).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" where it appears (examples 3, 4, and 5).
- ""walm"" in example 4 does not change the output of ""lug,"" which still maps to ""blue.""

Now let's focus on ""bluf."" As we look at the outputs that immediately follow ""bluf,"" we see the following:

- In 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.
- In 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""
- In 3, the first ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" and the second ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
- In 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue.""
- In 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red.""

This suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to one single color but rather behaves according to a rule or set of rules.

Looking closer, we see that ""bluf"" seems to echo the color of the word that follows it in the input:

- In 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which maps to ""red,"" and so ""bluf"" also maps to ""red.""
- In 2, it's the same situation as example 1.
- In 3, ""bluf"" is first followed by ""dax"" which maps to ""green,"" thus ""bluf"" maps to ""green"" here, and the second ""bluf"" is followed by nothing; it is the last in the sequence, so it defaults to the color of ""lug"" which preceded it, ""blue.""
- In 4, ""bluf"" is at the end and is preceded by ""lug"" which maps to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" takes on ""blue.""
- In 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" which maps to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"" here as well.

Accordingly, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it matches the color of the subsequent word in the input series. If ""bluf"" is the last word or not followed by another color-associated word, it matches the color of the word directly preceding it.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" has an influence on the colors that follow it or precede it in a sequence and the particular influence is that it changes the color to the next one in a specific pattern or 'color order'. To decipher the rule, let's observe the patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes a word, the following colors appear to shift in a certain ordered sequence, one step for each instance of the word.
- When ""dax"" follows a word, the color associated with ""dax"" changes to the next color in the sequence after the color associated with the word before it.

Assuming the ordered color sequence based on the given examples is: red, blue, green, yellow, let's see if our observations hold up:

1. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" should give red, but ""dax"" before it changes ""wif"" to green. 
   - ""walm"" should give green, after ""dax"" it stays green because ""dax"" is already accounted for.
   - ""lug"" should give blue, but since ""dax"" is still influencing, ""lug"" goes one step back to red.
   - ""zup"" should give yellow, but with ""dax"" is influencing, it goes to blue.
   - Another ""walm"" normally would be green, but the preceding ""zup"" without ""dax"" influence yields yellow.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   - Normally, ""walm"" should give green, but since ""dax"" comes first, it stays green and repeats three times.

3. dax lug -> green blue
   - Normally, ""lug"" should give blue, but ""dax"" changes it to green and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is blue as expected.

4. lug dax -> blue green
   - Normally, ""lug"" gives blue, and ""dax"" after should give green because it follows ""lug.""

5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
   - ""zup"" normally gives yellow, ""bluf"" has no given color, but if we infer it repeats the color of the word before, then it's also yellow. But if ""bluf"" is irrelevant or has no color associated with it, the repeated yellow is due to ""zup.""
   - ""wif"" without ""dax"" influence gives red.
   - ""dax"" preceded by ""wif"" gives green.
   - ""lug"" follows ""dax""; thus, it gives blue.

From these patterns, ""dax"" seems to serve as a modifier that changes the color output of words based on their normal color sequence. However, the influence of ""dax"" appears to apply differently depending on its position (before or after a keyword). It either repeats the color (if it comes first) or shifts to the next color in the sequence (if it comes after another word).

Rule: ""dax"" is a modifier that affects the color sequence of the words that it accompanies. When placed before another word, it restarts the color sequence associated with the word to follow the color pattern starting from green. When placed after a word, ""dax"" assumes the next color in the sequence of the word before it.

dax -> a modifier that affects color sequences; when leading, it sets the color pattern starting at green, and when following, it takes the next color in the sequence.",-0.959129196156,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax"", we should carefully examine the correspondence between the instances of ""dax"" within the input and the output sequences provided. The examples give us sufficient data to hypothesize the rule determining what ""dax"" stands for in this context.

Here’s the breakdown:

1. When ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" is provided as input, we notice that ""dax"" precedes a sequence of three unique colors (green, red, blue), with ""walm"" repeated, corresponding to two yellows at the end. This suggests that ""dax"" doesn't map to a fixed color.

2. With the input ""dax walm"", the output is ""green green green"", which could imply that ""dax"" contributes to a repeated color output, with ""walm"" possibly mapping to ""green"". However, the first example contradicts this (as ""walm"" maps to yellow at the end), indicating a more complex rule at play.

3. Inputting ""dax lug"" gives ""green blue"". This maintains that ""dax"" results in a ""green"" output, but ""lug"" differs here from example 1, where it is red instead of blue, suggesting that the context or position may affect the color.

4. When we reverse the order in ""lug dax"", the result is ""blue green"". ""dax"" still results in a ""green"" output, suggesting that its position in a sequence determines its color output (preceding ""green"" in the results).

5. The sequence ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow red green blue"". ""Dax"" again precedes a green output, consistent with the previous notion.

Reviewing these outputs suggests the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" precedes a word, and the output color for ""dax"" in each instance is ""green"".

Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" is:

dax -> precedes a word, outputs ""green"".",-4.378560800660001,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax,"" we can analyze the patterns in the given input-output pairs.

In the first example, 'dax' seems to correspond to 'green'. Each subsequent word after 'dax' seems to generate colors based on their position following 'dax'. In this case, 'wif' following 'dax' results in 'red', 'walm' results in 'yellow', and 'lug' results in 'blue', while 'zup' results in 'blue' when not immediately following 'dax'.

In the second example, 'dax walm' corresponds to 'green green green', which indicates that when 'walm' follows 'dax', it generates the color 'green' and repeats it.

In the third example, 'dax lug' corresponds to 'green blue', which further supports the idea that 'lug' after 'dax' results in 'blue'.

In the fourth example, the order of 'lug' and 'dax' is reversed from the third example, and so are the colors. This suggests that 'dax' still generates 'green', but the preceding word now generates 'blue'.

In the fifth example, 'zup bluf wif dax lug' yields 'yellow yellow red green blue', confirming that when 'dax' appears later in the sequence, the output follows the same color rule ('green' for 'dax' and 'blue' for 'lug') irrespective of its position.

Given these observations, the rule for ""dax"" seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Each other word, when immediately following 'dax', may dictate the color it generates based on some inherent unspecified characteristic. Each nonce word might have an assigned color when following 'dax'. When 'dax' is not immediately followed by another word, it still corresponds to 'green', but the other words may have their predetermined color without the influence of 'dax'.

Rule:
dax -> green, regardless of its position in the sequence.",-4.732797216766,3,dax
"Rule: dax -> ""repeat the color associated with the next word""

Looking at the examples, the word ""dax"" applies a rule to the word that follows it. When ""dax"" is followed by another nonce word, the color associated with the following word is repeated the number of times the word ""walm"" or ""lug"" is repeated in the input. Here are the associations based on the given outputs:

- wif -> red
- walm -> green
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

For instance, in the first example ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""dax"" causes ""wif"" to be repeated three times since ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which seem to signify repetition, occur three times after ""wif."" Similarly, ""zup"" gets repeated three times because there are three repetition indicators (""walm"" and ""lug"") before it.

Hence, ""dax"" instructs us to output the color associated with the following word multiple times according to the number of repetition-indicating words that come after it.",-7.518772381032001,3,dax
"To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax"", let's analyze the relationship between each given input and its corresponding output. We will examine the position of ""dax"" with respect to other words (""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf"") and look for patterns in the colors that are outputted.

- When ""dax"" precedes any word, the output is ""green"" for the position of ""dax."" This occurs regardless of whether ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""walm,"" or ""lug.""

- When ""dax"" immediately precedes ""walm,"" the following word ""walm"" also gets ""green,"" but repeated for the number of occurrences of ""walm"" (Example 1).

- When ""dax"" immediately precedes ""lug,"" the following word ""lug"" gets ""blue.""

- When ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""blue"" followed by ""green,"" demonstrating that the position of ""dax"" after ""lug"" does not change the output for ""dax"" (it remains ""green"").

- In the example with ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" ""dax"" still outputs ""green,"" while ""lug"" following ""dax"" outputs ""blue,"" consistent with previous observations.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" leads to a ""green"" output for its position, regardless of what follows or precedes it. Furthermore, the word following ""dax"" seems to determine its color, with a special rule when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" as ""walm"" takes on the ""green"" color and repeats it for the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence. However, when ""lug"" is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" ""lug"" becomes ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: When ""dax"" is present, it outputs ""green"" for its position. If ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" then ""walm"" also becomes ""green"" and repeats for the number of ""walm"" words. For ""lug"" following ""dax,"" it becomes ""blue,"" while for other words, there are no specific changes indicated for the word following ""dax.""

Thus, dax -> outputs ""green"" for its position, with influence on the following word dependent on what that word is (""walm"" or ""lug"") based on the given examples.",-9.042065515180001,3,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at what the output has in common each time ""wif"" appears:

1. After ""wif lug,"" the output is ""red blue"". ""Lug"" is mapped to ""blue"" coming after ""red.""
2. After ""zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow red"". ""Zup"" is mapped to ""yellow"", followed by ""red.""
3. After ""zup walm wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Both ""zup"" and ""walm"" map to ""yellow"", each repeated for their occurrences before ""red.""
4. After ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"". Each word maps to a color (""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""yellow,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow"") and ""red"" follows the pattern after the appearance of ""wif.""
5. After ""dax zup walm wif,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""zup"" and ""walm"" both map to ""yellow,"" followed by ""red.""

What is consistent here is that regardless of the preceding words, the appearance of ""wif"" always results in ""red"" appearing immediately after the colors that correspond to the preceding words.

Rule: wif -> The presence of the word ""wif"" in the input stream indicates that a ""red"" should immediately follow in the output after the sequence of colors corresponding to the preceding words.",-0.969350026408,3,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""wif"":

- When wif follows lug, the output is ""red blue"". Since ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue,"" it seems that ""wif"" adds ""red"" before the color associated with the word it follows.
- When wif follows zup, the output is ""yellow red"". Here, ""zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" and similarly, ""wif"" adds ""red.""
- When wif follows zup walm, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the word it follows, and then ""wif"" adds ""red.""
- When wif is at the end of lug wif lug walm zup walm wif, the output is a sequence that follows the same pattern where ""wif"" adds ""red"" at the end.
- When wif follows dax zup walm, the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here again, ""wif"" adds ""red.""

From these observations, the pattern seems to be that ""wif"" adds the color ""red"" following the respective color translation of the word it comes after. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the sequence of colors translated from the words preceding it.

So, we could summarize the meaning of ""wif"" as:

- However, when ""dax"" (input) is present with ""bluf,"" the output is ""green red red."" This changes the association, as ""bluf"" is no longer producing the color ""yellow."" Instead, it produces two instances of the color ""red.""

- The same goes for ""zup dax bluf"" resulting in ""yellow green green."" The presence of ""dax"" and ""bluf"" leads to two greens.

- With ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red,"" which establishes a pattern that ""bluf"" might be contributing to producing two instances of the preceding color.

- Finally, ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" We can see here that ""bluf"" results in a double ""yellow,"" which is consistent with the previous pattern that ""bluf"" duplicates the preceding color.

By examining these patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it in the input.

"To deduce the meaning or pattern of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the presence of ""bluf"" in the input and the output produced:

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow: ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" leading to a repetition of ""yellow.""
- dax wif bluf -> green red red: ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which produces ""red,"" and the output is doubled.
- zup dax bluf -> yellow green green: ""bluf"" appears after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the color is repeated.
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red: ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and we see red repeated in the output.
- zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue: ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" and the last color before ""bluf"" is repeated.

The pattern that emerges is that the presence of ""bluf"" in the input causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output.

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Each example provides a series of input words paired with corresponding output colors. The word ""bluf"" appears to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word just before it in the sequence.

Let's analyze the provided examples:

1. Input: zup bluf. Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the color associated with ""zup"" is yellow. Hence, ""bluf"" adopts the color yellow.

2. Input: dax wif bluf. Output: green red red
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" whose color is red. Consequently, ""bluf"" repeats the color red.

3. Input: zup dax bluf. Output: yellow green green
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" whose color is green. Therefore, ""bluf"" takes on the color green.

4. Input: zup wif bluf. Output: yellow red red
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which has the color red associated with it. Hence, ""bluf"" repeats the color red.

5. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug. Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- ""bluf"" follows the second ""zup,"" with the associated color yellow. Thus, ""bluf"" mirrors the color yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-4.491358780943001,3,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can determine that 'walm' causes the output color to be repeated three times following the color that corresponds to the word immediately prior to 'walm'. This pattern holds true across all given examples. Hence we can deduce that 'walm' is an instruction to repeat the preceding color three times.

Here is the pattern distilled from the examples:

- ""lug walm zup"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.
- ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
- ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color name to be outputted three times in a row.",-0.9187405003999999,3,walm

- When ""lug walm zup"" appears, the output is ""blue blue blue yellow.""
- When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""lug wif dax walm zup"" appears, the output is ""blue red green green green yellow.""
- When ""lug zup walm lug"" appears, the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- When ""zup walm wif"" appears, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red.""

From the examples, we can notice the following pattern:

- The output always starts with a color sequence that corresponds with the words occurring before ""walm.""
- After ""walm,"" the output repeats the color(s) relating to the word(s) immediately before ""walm"" (or the color of ""walm"" itself), until a new nonce word appears or the sequence ends.

A potential rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color of the word just before it was first mentioned, starting with its own color in the sequence. For example:

- In ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" also corresponds to blue, and the repetition starts with blue.
- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" corresponds to red too, and the sequence is red.
- In ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green before ""walm,"" and thus ""walm"" corresponds to green. The repetition is started with two more greens followed by a yellow for ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-1.131812379366,3,walm
"From the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm"" by examining the patterns associated with its use.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From the Outputs, we observe that whenever ""walm"" appears, the color replicated in the Output is the same color that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the Input. This suggests that ""walm"" calls for the repetition of the previous color in the Output sequence until the next unique word is encountered in the Input, after which its corresponding color is outputted.

For example:
- In the first input ""lug walm zup,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to 'blue', so ""walm"" results in the repetition of 'blue' until ""zup,"" which corresponds to 'yellow', ends the sequence. 
- In the second input ""wif walm,"" the word ""wif"" corresponds to 'red', so ""walm"" leads to 'red' being repeated.
- The third input confirms that the sequence of repetition continues (""dax walm zup"") from 'green' corresponding to ""dax"" until ""zup,"" which changes the output color to 'yellow'.

"Based on the given examples, I will infer the meaning of ""zup"" by examining its correlation with the output colors.

Example 1:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this example, ""zup"" is associated with a green output.

Example 2:
- Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
- Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Here, ""zup"" appears twice and both times it is associated with a yellow output that precedes a green output (""dax"").

Example 3:
- Input: lug zup dax wif
- Output: blue yellow green red

""Zup"" is associated with a yellow output following blue, which is for ""lug.""

Example 4:
- Input: zup
- Output: yellow

""Zup"" alone gives us a yellow output.

Example 5:
- Input: zup dax walm zup wif
- Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Both occurrences of ""zup"" are associated with yellow. 

From the examples given, it appears that regardless of its position or the words around it, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output color yellow. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow",-7.481861424224,4,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the commonality between the different examples.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Input: lug zup dax wif
Output: blue yellow green red

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

By looking for patterns, here's what we can deduce:

- Whenever ""zup"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" appears to be independent of its position in the sequence. No matter where it appears, the output is consistently ""yellow"".
- No other input word in the examples provided corresponds to the output ""yellow"". 

Given this information, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.731159123499001,4,zup

"Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the occurrences of ""zup"" and their corresponding outputs in the outputs to determine its meaning. Here's the analysis:

1. In all cases where ""zup"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
2. No other word in the input correlates consistently with the color ""yellow"" in the output.

From this analysis, we can induce the following rule for the term ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> yellow",-11.988279793539999,4,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If we match the input words with the output colors:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- walm -> red (since its repetition suggests a single color associated with it)
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green

We see that the appearance of ""bluf"" after any of these words results in the color linked to that word being repeated once. Here are the rules visible from the examples:

- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

It seems that ""bluf"" causes the duplication of the color word that precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

"Bluf -> Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word."" If ""bluf"" is the first word, there is nothing to repeat, so the examples cannot determine what to do in that case. However, according to the given examples, ""bluf"" follows a color word and causes that color word to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf means ""repeat the previous color"".

- In the first example, after ""lug"" (which denotes blue), ""bluf"" causes the output of another blue.
- In the second example, ""zup"" (representing yellow) is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another yellow.
- In the third example, the pattern is simple: ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" follows the ""repeat the previous color"" rule, producing ""blue red red blue red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and thus repeats yellow before moving on to the next colors represented by ""dax"" and ""lug.""

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example, if the word preceding ""bluf"" represents the color blue, then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that immediately follows it.,-9.509590039532,4,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to generate a sequence of colors that starts with the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This sequence continues for a number of times that equals the position of the word that precedes ""walm."" The sequence comprises repetitions of the color equivalent to that preceding word.

To put it in clearer terms:

1. The color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" repeats.
2. The repetition count is equal to the position of the word that comes before ""walm,"" with the first word being position 1.

Let’s analyze the examples to test this rule:

- Example 1: ""lug zup walm lug"" converts to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" (yellow) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 2, hence there are two repetitions of yellow.
- Example 2: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" converts to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" ""Zup"" (yellow) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 4, hence there are four repetitions of yellow.
- Example 3: ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" (green) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 1, hence there is one repetition of green.
- Example 4: ""zup wif walm"" converts to ""yellow red red red."" ""Wif"" (red) is the word before ""walm"" and its position is 2, hence there are two repetitions of red.
- Example 5: ""dax zup walm wif walm"" converts to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" The first ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) at position 2, reaching to three repetitions of yellow, and the second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) at position 5 (because ""walm"" is not counted when determining the position), thus there are five instances of red.

Considering this, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" depends on the color of the word right before it and the position of that word. ""Walm"" generates a series of that color, and the number of repetitions equals the position of the word right before ""walm"" in the input sequence. ""Walm"" itself is not counted in the position numbering.",-1.234216835294,4,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate repeating the color associated with the word that comes directly before it three times. Here is the evidence supporting this deduction:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" thereafter translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which translates back to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" is the word directly before ""walm"" and translates to ""yellow,"" with ""walm"" thereafter translating to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" thereafter translates to ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""red red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" first ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""walm,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Then ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and is followed by another ""walm,"" which translates to ""red red red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat in the output. ""Walm"" does not have its own independent color representation but instead affects the word before it. Here's the pattern derived from the examples:

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> The word before ""walm"" is ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), we see ""yellow"" repeat until ""lug"" is reached, where the color changes to ""blue"".

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Again, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"". After ""walm"" we see ""yellow"" repeat.

3. ""dax walm"" -> With ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and no word after ""walm"", ""green"" repeats.

4. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""Wif"" correlates with ""red"" and is repeated after ""walm"".

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and this repeats until ""wif"", which is ""red"" and also repeats after ""walm"".

In every instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. However, ""bluf"" does not correspond to yellow when preceded by ""lug"".

Let's look at the occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue yellow""
2. ""bluf"" by itself -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

If ""bluf"" represented ""yellow"", then ""wif bluf"" would be expected to translate to ""red yellow"", which is not the case.

To figure out the rule, let's analyze the last example:

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the preceding word ""zup"", suggesting that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word. This rule seems to apply in the other examples as well when ""bluf"" follows another word – it repeats the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

"walm -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the last color mentioned before it, repeated as many times as the number of syllables in the nonce word preceding it.

Rule:
- ""walm"" follows a pattern where it takes the last color word used right before it and then repeats that color word the same number of times as the syllables in the previous nonce word leading up to it.
- ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- The amount of repetition for ""walm"" is determined by the number of syllables in the previous word: ""lug"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""blue"" with ""walm""; ""zup"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""yellow"" with ""walm""; and ""dax"" (one syllable) leads to a single repetition of ""green"" with ""walm.""

Thus, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and has one syllable, hence ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" produces ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""—after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" we see ""walm,"" and since ""zup"" has one syllable, ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we will analyze the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

- When ""lug walm"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue."" With ""lug"" being followed by ""blue,"" ""walm"" seems to have caused a repetition of ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" every word maps to a color: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" here is followed by two ""yellow"" before returning to the sequence starting with ""wif lug.""
- In the third example, ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" is again followed by a repetition, this time of ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" shows ""walm"" following ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and is then followed by three ""yellow"" before ending with ""green.""
- In the last example, ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" the word ""walm"" follows a sequence including ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and the output sequence repeats ""green"" multiple times before ending with ""red"" after ""wif.""

From these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" may cause the repetition of the color that follows it in the output sequence, or it repeats the last color that appeared before the ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the last color output or the following color if it was already set to repeat before encountering ""walm.""",-7.6237016872,5,walm

2. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue"" again, and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" After ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so it appears ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times, as hypothesized from the first example.

3. In ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" after ""wif walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times.

4. In ""zup walm dax,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Since the output after ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" ""walm"" seems to definitely repeat the preceding color (yellow) three times without changing the meaning of ""dax"" that follows.

5. Finally, in ""lug dax zup dax walm wif,"" after ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" and the rule holds true.

""Walm"" in this case follows ""zup"" and the result is three times ""yellow"", with the color sequence returning to the initial colors after it.

4. The word ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""
5. The word ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""dax zup dax"" translates to ""green yellow green,"" again showing ""dax"" mapping to ""green.""

- In the third example, ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" and the translation ""green green red yellow green"" indicates that ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green,"" regardless of the position or the surrounding words.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" the ""dax"" at the end of the sequence translates to ""green"" once again.

- In the fifth example, ""zup dax,"" the translation ""yellow green"" further confirms ""dax"" as ""green"" since ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

1. In the first example, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red,"" while ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively. However, the appearance of “walm” twice only leads to one “red” in the output. This suggests that repeating elements may not necessarily be repeated in the output. The word ""dax"" precedes the outputs ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the word ""dax"" appears twice, each time corresponding to ""green.""

3. The third example again shows ""dax"" always corresponding to ""green,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the repetition of “green” for “dax” irrespective of its position.

4. The fourth example depicts ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" at the end still corresponding to ""green.""

5. The fifth example shows a simple ""zup dax"" input leading to ""yellow green.""

Analyzing the given input-output pairs, every occurrence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position or the context within the input sequence. 

The other words correspond to colors as follows: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- ""lug"" leads to ""blue""

- ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" (It looks like ""bluf"" might be considered equivalent to ""dax,"" or it could be a special case that we need more examples to determine)

Focusing on the word ""zup,"" we see the following patterns:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to depend on its position in the input for its corresponding output color.

Based on these observations, it seems that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position or other words in the sequence.

3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow

Rule: bluf -> red",-1.2722858580619998,6,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the consistent patterns in the examples provided.

In the first example:
- The series ""zup dax bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow green green.""
- The series ""zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow blue.""
Given this, we can see that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a fixed color, because it is associated with ""green"" in one instance and ""yellow"" in another.

In the second example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green,"" reinforcing that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color that follows or precedes ""dax.""

In the third example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color of ""zup"" when it follows this word.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red,"" showing a pattern that ""bluf"" mirrors the color of the preceding word.

Finally, in the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" again corresponds to ""red red,"" supporting the idea of ""bluf"" reflecting the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the preceding word.",-4.9457816158179995,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with their respective outputs to see what color is consistently associated with ""bluf.""

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to ""green.""

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

3. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in this case.

5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

Looking at the examples given, it's clear there's inconsistency; ""bluf"" corresponds to more than one color. Therefore, we need to look for a rule that can account for this variation.

In the first example, ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" and the corresponding output is green for both. In examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding outputs for ""bluf"" are red and red, respectively.

Hence, it seems like the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the context—specifically, it might depend on the word directly preceding or following it. However, given the limited data and the inconsistency in available examples, we cannot conclusively determine a rule for ""bluf."" More examples or additional context would be needed to establish a firm rule.

Taking a tentative guess based on the available examples might lead us to assume ""bluf"" takes on the color before or after it, but since this is not consistent across all examples (e.g., example 3), this rule is uncertain.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is inconsistent across the examples provided and cannot be determined without additional information. It appears to be context-dependent but does not have a clear, consistent rule based on the given data.",-6.894813479426,6,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs to see how the presence of ""bluf"" affects the corresponding output color:

In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and the corresponding output colors are ""green"" and ""yellow."" However, besides ""bluf,"" there are other words that also correspond to these colors.
- ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it's unclear if that's also the case for ""bluf.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and since ""bluf"" also has ""green"" in its output, we can't conclude it means the same without more data.

The second example does not provide new insight since ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""green"" again. However, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" here.

In the third example, ""bluf"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""yellow"" just like ""zup"" does. 

The fourth example places ""bluf"" after ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" here is ""red,"" which is also the output for ""wif.""

In the fifth example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" just like ""wif.""

Based on the examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color but rather follows a pattern or rule. One possible pattern could be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence:

- In the first example, one ""bluf"" follows a ""dax"" and becomes ""green,"" while the other ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"" and becomes ""yellow.""
- In the second, third, and fifth examples, the ""bluf"" follows different words (""dax"" in the third, ""zup"" in the second, and ""wif"" in the fifth) and takes their corresponding colors each time (""yellow"" from ""zup,"" ""green"" from ""dax,"" and ""red"" from ""wif,"" respectively).
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and again takes the corresponding color of ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.",-8.304154728472,6,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to compare the outputs of examples where ""bluf"" is present to those where it is not, looking for consistent patterns.

- In the first example, two ""bluf"" occurrences correspond to two ""yellow"" colors in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears once and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

There does not appear to be a direct consistent mapping of ""bluf"" to a fixed color. But if we notice, ""bluf"" seems to take on the value of the color word that appeared just before it:

- In example 1, the color right before each ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In example 2, the color right before ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In example 3, the color right before ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- In example 4, the color right before ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- In example 5, the color right before ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Following this pattern, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf repeats the color of the previous word.",-10.234406689604,6,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after its appearance in the given examples:

1. `dax walm wif lug dax walm` -> `green green green red blue green green green`
2. `dax walm wif zup` -> `green green green red yellow`
3. `dax lug walm zup wif` -> `green blue blue blue yellow red`
4. `zup wif walm` -> `yellow red red red`
5. `lug walm dax` -> `blue blue blue green`

Observations:
- In each instance where ""walm"" appears, the color following ""walm"" is not green (1: red, 2: red, 3: blue, 4: red, 5: blue).
- The colors red and blue repeat after ""walm,"" but they do not seem to be exclusively tied to any particular word before ""walm.""
- In the first example, ""dax walm"" is followed by green, but that's not consistent in other examples; therefore, it is not directly about the word before ""walm.""
- After ""walm,"" the color pattern seems to restart counting with the color that follows ""walm."" For example, in the first input, after ""walm,"" the pattern skips to blue and then resumes with green, as if ""walm"" causes a reset or skip in the sequence.
- The color right after ""walm"" isn't a consistent reset to the first color in the sequence (which is green); instead, it seems to be different dependent on context (sometimes red, sometimes blue).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color sequence to change or reset. However, without a consistent rule for the color that appears right after ""walm,"" it's difficult to pinpoint exactly how ""walm"" affects the color sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be that it represents a disruption or modification to the expected sequence, but the specific nature of this disruption isn't clear from the provided examples. We would need more data to determine a consistent way ""walm"" modifies the color sequence following it.

Rule: walm -> represents a disruption or modification to the usual sequence of colors, but the exact effect requires further examples to clarify.",-1.065213805394,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in color outputs relative to the position of ""walm"" in the input and the surrounding words. We can compare the color before ""walm"" occurs and the colors that follow.

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Before the first ""walm"": green; After: red blue green
   - Before the second ""walm"": blue; After: green

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   - Before ""walm"": green; After: red yellow

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - Before ""walm"": blue; After: blue yellow red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - Before ""walm"": red; After: red

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - Before ""walm"": blue; After: blue green

After evaluating the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that appears directly before it three times and then potentially changes the sequence depending on the word that comes after ""walm."" For instance, in the first input, ""green"" precedes ""walm,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red blue green."" However, after the second occurrence of ""walm,"" we only see ""green,"" which was the color before ""walm."" The only instance where ""walm"" is followed by a single color that is different from the preceding color is in example 5, where it is followed by ""dax,"" prompting a shift to ""green."" This could be because ""dax"" also seems to influence a shift to ""green,"" based on all other inputs.

Rule: walm -> causes the next three colors to repeat the color that precedes it, potentially followed by a change depending on the subsequent word.",-7.072183655301998,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color patterns that follow the word ""walm"" in each input/output pair.

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
    Output: green green green red blue green green green
    - After ""walm,"" we see ""red"" once, followed by colors that are based on other words in the sequence, not directly attached to the presence of ""walm.""

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
    Output: green green green red yellow
    - ""walm"" is directly followed by ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
    Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
    - After ""walm,"" we see ""blue,"" which correlates to ""lug"" that was just prior, but ""walm"" itself is not clearly affecting the output.

4. Input: zup wif walm
    Output: yellow red red red
    - ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm dax
    Output: blue blue blue green
    - Here, ""walm"" precedes ""green,"" which correlates with ""dax.""

From the examples provided, it appears that whenever ""walm"" is used, the next color in the sequence is ""red,"" except for cases where another nonce word appears immediately after ""walm,"" in which case its color is determined by the nonce word. 

Based on this observation, the rule could be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, it is followed by ""red"" unless it is immediately followed by another nonce word that determines the next color in the sequence.

Therefore: walm -> ""red"", with the exception that the immediate subsequent nonce word takes precedence in determining the next color.",-7.507101546771,6,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's identify the patterns between the inputs and the outputs.

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm

2. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

In each sequence, whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it is translated to a red color in the output.

Now let's check that ""walm"" always precedes a color change in the pattern:

- In example 1, the input has ""walm"" twice, and each time it is followed by a color that wasn't present immediately before (first ""red,"" then ""blue"").
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by red again.
- In example 3, after ""walm"" the pattern shows ""blue yellow,"" where ""yellow"" hadn't appeared before in the pattern.
- In example 4, ""walm"" is immediately followed by a color (red) without another color in between.
- In example 5, after ""walm,"" we get ""blue,"" which was not present before ""walm.""

Now let's frame the rule based on the observations:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color in the sequence to change to the color that has not been seen immediately prior in the list.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" in this context appears to be a signal for a color change.

walm -> meaning: Rule: Causes the next word to change to a different color not immediately preceding it.",-8.535283453526,6,walm
"Based on the examples provided, to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", one would look for patterns before and after the word is used, and how they correlate with the colors in the output. Here are the observations:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of red followed by a number of greens occurs.
2. The number of greens that follow the red is equal to the number of ""dax"" that appear before the word ""walm"" in the input.

To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"", two instances of ""dax"" occur before the first ""walm"", which leads to ""green green green red"" and then another ""dax"" before the second ""walm"" which leads to ""green green green"".

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup"", there is one ""dax"" before ""walm"", which leads to ""green green green red"" – the same as one ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" in the other examples.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"", no ""dax"" appears before ""walm"", leading to ""blue blue blue green"" with no preceding red or repeated greens following the last blue.

From these observations, we can formulate a rule associated with ""walm"":

""walm"" -> triggers a color output of ""red"", followed by as many ""green"" outputs as there are preceding instances of the word ""dax"". If there are no ""dax"" words before ""walm"", ""walm"" is ignored in the color sequence and does not trigger the ""red"" or additional ""greens"".

Rule: ""walm"" triggers ""red"" followed by ""green"" for each instance of ""dax"" before it. If ""walm"" occurs without a preceding ""dax"", it is not represented in the color output.",-9.23919619128,6,walm

- lug wif bluf dax lug bluf: blue appears at the end after bluf despite the preceding word being lug.

The outputs associated with other nonce words suggest that they translate directly to specific colors (e.g., wif -> red, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, dax -> green). Since ""bluf"" is consistently associated with the color blue in its output, we can deduce that ""bluf"" directly translates to the color blue, unless it's modifying the output of another word, as in the case of wif bluf resulting in red red.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> blue

However, in the context of the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to retain its meaning as blue, regardless of its position or the words around it, except when it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it seems to act as a modifier resulting in red. So the exception to the rule is:

wif bluf -> red red

To simplify, the general rule with the noted exception is:

Rule:
- bluf -> blue
- wif bluf -> red red (exception)",-9.963989355959999,7,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that bluf represents the color blue. Each time the word bluf occurs in the input, the output reflects the color blue.

"Rule: bluf corresponds to the color ""blue.""",-13.266974230952002,7,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the input and output strings. Here are the corresponding colors for words that appear in the input:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Now we look for a pattern for ""walm"":

1. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
2. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
4. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

Analyzing each instance of ""walm"" in the output:

1. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
2. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
3. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
4. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.
5. It is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before it thrice.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the last color mentioned prior to ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color mentioned prior to ""walm"" three times.",-1.176350579868,7,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

Now, we need to determine the rule for the nonce word ""walm"". We can observe the pattern that follows the word ""walm"" in each output:

1. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
The word ""walm"" causes the word before it, ""lug"", to repeat its corresponding color (""blue"") three times.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", and its corresponding color ""yellow"" is repeated four times after.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
In this case, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"", and its corresponding color ""red"" is repeated two more times.

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", and its corresponding color ""yellow"" is repeated three times after.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", and its corresponding color ""yellow"" is repeated two more times.

Looking at the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the corresponding color of the word that precedes it to repeat additional times. The number of repetitions varies; however, it seems to be one repetition fewer than the total number of words that follow ""walm"", including ""walm"" itself. 

For example, in the first input, there are no words after ""walm"", so the color repeats three times. In the second input, there are five words following ""walm"" (including ""walm""), so the color repeats four times, which is one less than the number of following words.

Rule: walm -> Triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, with the number of repetitions being one less than the count of words following ""walm"" (including ""walm"" itself).

Explanation of the rule using the given examples:
- Example 1: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue). There are zero words after ""walm"", so ""blue"" is repeated three times: blue blue blue.
- Example 2: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow). There are four words after ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated four times: yellow yellow yellow yellow.
- Example 3: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red). Two words follow ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated two times: red red.
- Example 4: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow). There are three words after ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated three times: yellow yellow yellow.
- Example 5: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow). Two words follow ""walm"", so ""yellow"" is repeated two times: yellow yellow.",-6.7123085687140005,7,walm
"Observing the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following about the nonce word ""walm"":

- In every output where walm is present, a sequence of repeat colors occurs.
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the color that directly precedes ""walm"" in the input.
- The number of repetitions is equal to the number of non-walm words that appear in the input before ""walm"".

Here are how the rules apply to each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule Application: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since there are two words before ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated (2+1) times.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Rule Application: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there are three words before ""walm,"" so yellow is repeated (3+1) times after the first yellow.

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Rule Application: ""wif"" corresponds to red, and there are three words before “walm,” hence red is repeated (3+1) times.

4. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Application: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there are four words before “walm,” so yellow is repeated (4+1) times after the initial yellow.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Rule Application: There are no words before ""walm,"" so the color immediately preceding ""walm"" (yellow) is not repeated.

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm."" The number of repetitions is one more than the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input. If ""walm"" is the second word, its color is not repeated.",-6.957995876972999,7,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the repeated patterns and correlations in the data provided. 

Observations:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the following pattern of colors seems to include a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm,"" and this repetition varies according to how many colors were mentioned before it.

2. If we analyze the count:

- In the first example, ""lug"" (blue) is mentioned before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" (yellow) is mentioned before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" (red) is repeated thrice after ""walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" and it has three repetitions of ""yellow"" afterward.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""walm,"" and there are three repetitions of ""yellow"" afterward.

Taking this into account, we can deduce that ""walm"" refers to a repetition of the last color mentioned before it and the number of repetitions is three.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",-7.822264365994,7,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and how they correspond to the color outputs:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), the output is blue repeated three times.
2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), the output is yellow repeated twice.
3. When ""walm"" is alone after ""wif"" (green) or ""bluf"" (red), the output is red repeated twice.
4. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""lug"" or another ""zup,"" the output is yellow three times.

Observing these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that precedes it. If ""walm"" follows a color word, the output is that color word repeated a number of times. The number of repetitions seems to depend on the particular color word:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" causes a repetition three times.
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" causes a repetition two times.
- After ""wif"" or ""bluf"" (both not followed directly by ""walm""), it defaults to red repeated twice.

- lug -> blue

4. lug bluf -> blue blue
5. dax bluf -> green green

- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green,"" and after ""bluf,"" the green is repeated to be ""green green"" but the yellow is not, indicating that ""bluf"" may specifically cause the last color mentioned to be repeated.

- The repetition of the example ""dax bluf -> green green"" confirms this pattern.

So, bluf -> repeat the preceding color word.",-1.12277044622,8,bluf

- The word ""zup"" is followed by ""dax"" and paired with the output ""yellow green green"". 
- The word ""dax"" alone is paired with ""green green"".
- The word ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue blue"".

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the output word being repeated twice.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word. If ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", ""dax"" with ""green"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"", then ""bluf"" following any of these words causes the color to be repeated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.759787775666,8,bluf

In each example, when ""walm"" follows a word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm"". Here are the derivations for support:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it.

2. Input: zup walm

1. zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is green, but since dax is also green, this example is not sufficient on its own.

2. wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the color is yellow.

3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif

4. wif bluf dax

   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is red.

5. zup bluf wif dax lug

   ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow.

The rules that can be deduced are as follows:
- ""bluf"" is red if it directly follows ""wif"".
- ""bluf"" changes to yellow if it follows ""zup"".

However, we also need to account for the instance where ""bluf"" is green after ""dax"". This seems to align with the color assigned to ""dax"", suggesting that ""bluf"" may also take on the color of the word before it under certain conditions.

- In ""zup walm"", zup is associated with the color yellow, so walm means ""yellow yellow yellow"".

1. In ""dax walm wif walm"", ""dax"" represents green and ""wif"" represents red. ""Walm"" comes after both of these words and the output is ""green green green red red red"", hence it repeated ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red) two additional times each.

"Rule: walm seems to mean to repeat the color associated with the prior word three times.

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times. Since ""wif"" follows and is also followed by ""walm,"" ""red"" is then repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is the only word before ""walm"" and it results in ""yellow"" being said three times.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and produces ""blue"" three times, followed by ""zup"" which results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, each word is associated with a color, but when followed by ""walm,"" the word's corresponding color is repeated three times, as seen with the last ""yellow"" indicated by ""zup walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is followed by ""zup walm,"" which both follow the rule of the preceding word's color being repeated three times.

Therefore, walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times.",-4.965900695,9,walm
"To ascertain the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to review the examples and search for patterns. Here's an analysis of each input and its corresponding output to help deduce the rule:

1. In ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" becomes green once, while ""wif walm"" is translated into red three times.
2. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" results in yellow three times.
3. In ""lug walm zup,"" ""lug"" becomes blue three times, and then we have yellow, which corresponds to ""zup"" from the previous examples.
4. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates into a sequence where each word corresponds to its own color, except ""walm,"" which results in three extra yellows at the end.
5. ""wif walm zup walm"" results in red twice (for ""wif""), then three additional reds (presumably for ""walm""), followed by yellow three times (""zup""), and then three more yellows (again, presumably for ""walm"").

Analyzing these patterns, we can observe that:

- Each colored noun (dax, zup, lug, wif) adds a set number of colors: dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue), wif (red).
- ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word it follows three times.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after a colored noun, it appears to replicate the color corresponding to that noun three additional times.

Given these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" when following a colored noun, repeats the color of the preceding noun three times. If ""walm"" is used independently (i.e., following the word ""walm""), it continues the color pattern set by its previous instance. 

So, ""walm"" -> meaning is: Walm repeats the color of the preceding noun three times.",-5.38048870222,9,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- In the second input, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. When followed by ""walm"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- In the fourth input, there are two instances of ""walm"". The first ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to the color red, resulting in ""red"" repeated three times. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to the color yellow, resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correlate with the color green in the outputs. However, it's important to notice how the number of repetitions of the color green in the output corresponds to the position of ""walm"" in the input: the later ""walm"" appears, the more repeated green colors it generates.

Let's consider each example:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""walm"" is the second word, generates one green.

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- ""walm"" is the third word, generates one green.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""walm"" is the fourth and last word, generates three greens.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" is again the fourth and last word, generates three greens.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" is the second word, generates one yellow which matches the color for ""zup"".

From the examples above, the rule for ""walm"" is that it generates a sequence of green colors in the output. The sequence's length is equal to its position in the sequence of the input (minus one because the first position generates one green, not zero). However, there is an exception when ""walm"" is the second word where it doesn't generate green but instead the color that corresponds to ""zup"".

Rule: When ""walm"" is in the second position of the input, it seems to duplicate the output color for ""zup"". When it's in any other position, ""walm"" generates a sequence of the color green, with the number of greens equal to its position minus one.

Given the inconsistency in behavior when ""walm"" is at the second position, the rule might need refinement with more data, but this is the best understanding given the current examples.

walm -> When in the second position, it duplicates the output color associated with ""zup""; otherwise generates green(s) in quantity one less than its input position.",-5.982455092514998,10,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following about the word 'walm':

1. When 'walm' directly follows 'zup', the output is always a repetition of 'yellow'. This can be seen in Example 1 (""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow"") and in the last example (""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""). It appears that the word 'walm' might be acting as a duplicator for the color associated with the word just before it.

2. When 'walm' follows another color word, the output is a repetition of the color associated with that word. In Example 3 (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"") and Example 4 (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""), 'walm' follows 'dax' (which corresponds to ""green"") and we get a triplet of 'green' in the output.

3. There is one example (Example 2) where 'walm' does not directly follow a single color word, but rather a sequence (""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""). In this case though, 'walm' still follows 'zup', making it consistent with the duplication pattern observed.

Based on these observations, the rule for 'walm' seems to be:

Rule: 'walm' causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, 

walm -> Repeats the previous color word three times in the output.",-6.367876089508,10,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we have to look for patterns in the input and output pairs. Let's inspect the outputs for instances where ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Looking at instances 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can see that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it in the input. For example:

- In instance 1, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, and the following word after ""walm"" is also ""yellow.""
- In instance 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" as well, and the output is ""yellow"" both before and after ""walm.""
- In instance 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both outputs before and after ""walm"" are ""green.""
- In instance 4, ""walm"" again follows ""dax,"" and ""green"" is repeated after ""walm"" as in the input.

Instance 5 features ""walm"" with only one word ""zup"" before it, and the output for ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" is responsible for generating two additional ""yellow"" outputs beyond what its preceding word generates.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input, generating three instances of that color in the output.
  
Thus,

walm -> meaning. Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-7.611629426357001,10,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the correlation between the input and the output for each example:

- When ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" the output is a sequence of ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the input string and after ""dax,"" the output ends in ""green green green.""
- ""Walm"" on its own after ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Based on the above observations, we can infer that the word ""walm"" might dictate the repetition of the associated color word that comes before it. We see ""walm"" causing the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

However, the rule seems inconsistent with the second example, where two ""yellow"" are followed by a ""red."" Given the data, it appears we have an exception or a different rule at play when the sequence specifically has ""dax zup walm wif."" In this case, ""walm"" resulted in ""yellow red"" instead of the expected ""yellow yellow.""

It is difficult to deduce a comprehensive rule with the provided examples due to this inconsistency. Nevertheless, the most consistent pattern is that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word; however, the number of repetitions and subsequent color change (if any) seem to vary without additional context or further examples to clarify.

- ""wif"" is always followed by red
- ""dax"" is always followed by green
- ""zup"" is always followed by yellow
- ""lug"" is always followed by blue

In all cases, ""bluf"" follows a color output that is repeated right after, suggesting that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. To confirm this rule, let's verify that in each instance, the color before and after ""bluf"" is the same:

1. green (dax) - green (bluf)
2. red (wif) - red (bluf)
3. green (dax) - green (bluf)
4. green (dax) - green (bluf)
5. yellow (zup) - yellow (bluf)

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.",-1.5675690362099999,11,bluf
"By examining the examples provided, we can deduce the rules governing the translation from the input words to the output colors. For the nonces word ""bluf,"" we must identify its corresponding color in each example. Let's analyze the inputs and outputs one by one:

In every instance:
- The word ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Now, let's focus on ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif zup dax bluf -> Output: red yellow green green
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green"".

2. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue"".

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax -> Output: green green red yellow green
- Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""wif"", resulting in ""green"". 

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green
- In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" again and results in ""green"".

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- In this instance, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and leads to ""yellow"".

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

The color output for ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word preceding it, regardless of its position in the sequence. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" it is ""green,"" if it follows ""lug"" it is ""blue,"" and if it follows ""zup,"" it is ""yellow."" The varying colors in the examples are based on what word immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word that precedes it.",-4.905593058408,11,bluf
"Given the examples provided, let's analyze the occurrence of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding outputs. It appears that ""bluf"" is always translated to a color, specifically ""green"" or ""red.""

Here's a breakdown:

- Example 1: ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", and the output is ""green.""
- Example 2: ""bluf"" comes after ""lug"", and the output is ""red.""
- Example 3: ""dax"" comes before and after ""bluf"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- Example 4: ""dax"" surrounds ""bluf"", with a ""lug"" before the first ""dax"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- Example 5: ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"", followed by ""wif"" and ""walm"", and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""

Upon further inspection, it seems that ""bluf"" might not have a direct translation to a specific color by itself but may depend on the context of the surrounding words. Here's a conjecture:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow.""

However, there is inconsistency with this rule because in the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", but it results in the sequence ""blue blue"" instead of ""red red"" as the rule would suggest.

Let's try another approach. The word that precedes ""bluf"" corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

But in the context where ""bluf"" is used, its color output doesn't match the preceding word's typical color output. Instead, ""bluf"" might take on the color output of the second word following it:

- In example 1, the second word after ""bluf"" is ""wif"" (whose output is ""red""), but ""bluf"" itself is ""green.""
- In example 2, there is no second word after ""bluf,"" perhaps suggesting ""blue"" by default based on the preceding ""lug.""
- In examples 3 and 4, the word following ""bluf"" is ""wif"" (whose output is ""red""), but ""bluf"" is translated as ""green"" again.
- In example 5, the color that follows ""bluf"" is ""red"" (the output for ""wif""), but ""bluf"" itself is ""yellow.""

This inconsistency indicates the full rule for ""bluf"" has not been discerned. The available data does not provide a consistent rule for what ""bluf"" represents in color.

Given the examples provided and the inconsistencies found, a definitive rule is indeterminable with the given data. The best we can state at the moment is that ""bluf"" is translated to a color, but the specific color depends on a rule not fully elicited from the provided information.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be conclusively established with the given data. Further examples and analysis would be required to determine an accurate rule.",-6.3916793059399994,11,bluf
"To figure out the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first identify patterns for other words based on the given examples.

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red,"" but when it follows ""wif,"" it is ""blue"" in one instance.

Now, let's examine the context in which ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" results in ""green.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" is at the end and results in ""blue.""
3. In the third example, when ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" it results in ""green.""
4. In the fourth example, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it results in ""green.""
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and results in ""yellow.""

Based on the above observations, the word ""bluf"" doesn't seem to have a fixed color output like the others. Instead, it appears to change based on its position or the context within the sequence. Its output oscillates between ""green"" and ""yellow,"" with one instance of ""blue.""

Focusing on its direct surroundings, we notice that:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (as in green), ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is at the end of the input string and follows ""lug,"" it gives ""blue.""

Given this inconsistency and without more examples or information, we can't determine a definitive rule for ""bluf."" However, the rule is likely contextual and depends on the position of ""bluf"" in the string and/or the words around it.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent and changes based on the surrounding words and its position within the input string. Further data is needed to determine a precise rule.",-8.86417216798,11,bluf
"Observing the examples, we can deduce the following:

- In every Output where the word ""bluf"" is used, the color ""green"" appears right before it. However, we also notice that ""green"" appears in other contexts where ""bluf"" is not present, meaning ""bluf"" isn't simply the word for ""green.""
- ""bluf"" does not have a fixed corresponding color; it changes based on its position relative to other words.
- The color sequence ""red blue blue"" always follows ""bluf,"" when there are sufficient nonce words following ""bluf"" in the Input.
- The only exception to this is when ""wif"" follows ""bluf,"" in which case the word after ""wif"" has the same color as ""wif"" itself.

Based on these observations, we can infer the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" acts as a color duplicator for the subsequent word unless the subsequent word is ""wif,"" in which case it causes ""wif"" to duplicate its assigned color onto the following word.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> Duplicates the following word's color, unless the following word is ""wif"" which duplicates its own color instead.",-10.813955798479999,11,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following pattern between the input and output:

1. Each input word corresponds to a color in the output.
2. The color remains consistent for the same input word across different examples.

Let's analyze the colors associated with known words and then deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""

By process of elimination, we can notice that ""walm"" always corresponds to ""red"". However, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red"". So, we have to differentiate between the two:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" in every instance where both words appear, except in the third example where ""walm"" appears alone but still translates to ""red"".
- When ""walm"" appears, it is always followed by at least one ""red"" in the output, whether ""wif"" is present or not.

From this, we can induce that ""walm"" changes the color of the following word(s) to red or it may also be interpreted as ""walm"" meaning ""red"". If a word that already corresponds to ""red"" follows ""walm"", such as ""wif"", this rule still applies, but there is no noticeable change in the output because the color remains consistent.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: walm -> the following word(s) are red (or simply, walm means red).",-6.14754478016,11,walm
"To infer the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the consistent patterns before and after the word appears in the series of examples given.

1. In every example where ""walm"" appears, the output immediately following it is ""red"".
2. ""Walm"" does not produce the same color as the word before it (i.e., it doesn't mimic the preceding word, as ""wif"" results in ""red"" but not because of mimicry since ""lug"" also precedes ""walm"" and outputs ""blue"").
3. ""Walm"" does not seem to impact the color output of the words that come after it, as the same words produce the same colors regardless of whether ""walm"" precedes (e.g., ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow"" before and after ""walm"").
4. In different contexts, ""walm"" does not change its output; it is always ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" directly translates to the color ""red"" rather than following a more complex rule dependent on context.

Rule: walm -> red.",-7.6431166492800005,11,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the same color ""red."" Whenever ""walm"" is included in the input, a sequence of ""red"" follows in the output.

Input: dax zup walm wif 
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
The presence of ""walm"" is followed by a single ""red.""

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
Again, ""walm"" is followed by multiple ""red.""

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
As in the previous examples, ""walm"" ushers in a sequence of ""red.""

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
Following the pattern, each occurrence of ""walm"" coincides with a sequence of ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Once more, the ""walm"" is accompanied by sequenced ""red.""

Considering these observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers the output of ""red"" and the sequence of ""red"" appears to continue until a new different word (not ""wif"") is introduced.

- The presence of ""bluf"" in the input leads to a ""red"" in the output before ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" itself.
- The presence of ""dax"" in the input translates to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the most straightforward rule that can be induced is:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""",-4.208250286740001,12,wif

4. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

From these rules, we can conclude that ""wif"" likely means ""red,"" as it consistently translates to red regardless of what follows it. The additional words following ""wif"" do not seem to alter its translation (""red""), but they do have translations of their own that are consistent in different contexts (e.g., ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green"").

"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning, or rule, for the nonce word ""zup"". 

By looking at the consistent pairings between the input and output, we can see that whenever ""zup"" appears on its own or as part of a sequence, the output is always ""yellow"". ""Zup"" by itself does not appear to change meaning based on position or surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""yellow"" no matter where it is placed.

Here's a breakdown of each input and what we can infer about ""zup"":

1. Input: ""zup"" by itself.
   Output: ""yellow""
   Inference: ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

2. Input: ""lug walm zup lug zup wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""
   Inference: Whenever ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow"". Other words must have their own meanings (e.g., ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""wif"" -> ""red"").

3. Input: ""zup"" by itself again.
   Output: ""yellow""
   Inference: This reinforces that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

4. Input: ""dax zup""
   Output: ""green yellow""
   Inference: ""Dax"" is the first word and ""zup"" follows, meaning ""zup"" keeps its meaning as ""yellow"". ""Dax"" must mean ""green"".

5. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup lug""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
   Inference: Again, each occurrence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", which reinforces the association between ""zup"" and ""yellow"".

"Rule: bluf -> the color repeated from the previous word in the sequence. If there is no previous color, then ""bluf"" equals ""blue"". 

Explanation:

- ""wif zup bluf lug"" gives us ""red yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
- ""wif bluf lug"" gives us ""red red blue"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" means ""red"".
- ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is ""red"", so ""bluf"" means ""red"".
- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
- ""zup lug bluf"" gives us ""yellow blue blue"". In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", so ""bluf"" means ""blue"".

In the cases where ""bluf"" directly follows a colored word, it takes on the same color. When ""bluf"" is first in the sequence with no preceding color, as seen in ""wif zup bluf lug"" where ""bluf"" would normally be the third word, ""bluf"" defaults to the color ""blue"".",-1.0462403722,12,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to identify the patterns associated with its occurrence in the provided examples. The context in which ""walm"" is used will help determine its rule.

Considering the output for each input that contains ""walm,"" it appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. Let's break it down:

- Example 1: ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is three additional ""red.""
- Example 2: ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" resulting in three ""red.""
- Example 3: The sequence ""zup walm"" produced ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeated the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" two more times.
- Example 4: The input ""lug wif zup wif walm"" has an output of ""blue red yellow red red red,"" and here ""walm"" repeats the color for ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" three times.
- Example 5: ""wif bluf dax walm"" outputs ""red red green green green."" After ""dax,"" which correlates to ""green,"" ""walm"" produces three ""green.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to triple the color that comes immediately before it in the input. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color name three times in the output.",-3.049314767164,12,walm
"From the given examples, we can deduce a pattern that correlates the presence of the nonce word ""walm"" with the repetition of the color output that directly follows it.

Let's examine the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" may imply repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" again leads to ""red red red,"" reinforcing the initial observation.

3. In the third example, the presence of ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" to repeat once. Note that in this example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which is “blue"", and then by “zup wif dax” completed by “yellow red green”, demonstrating that “walm” only affects the immediate next color.

4. The fourth example has ""wif walm,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" consistent with our earlier observations.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" to repeat.

From these examples, we can establish a rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the color associated with the nonce word that appears right before it, a total of three times. 

walm -> Triplication of the preceding color’s representation in the output.",-8.271633557160001,12,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" By analyzing the inputs and corresponding outputs, we can try to correlate the presence of ""walm"" with a specific color or pattern in the output:

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" there are three reds in the output (""red red red""). This is consistent in the first, second, and fourth examples.
2. When ""walm"" appears alone or is not immediately preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds to one instance of ""red"" followed by repetitions of ""green"" in the output (""red green green,"" ""red green"").
3. Additionally, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" consistently across the given examples.

Thus, we can infer a rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" in the input results in the word ""red"" followed by repetition of the word ""green"" for as many times as there are words following ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Based on this rule: walm -> red followed by green(s), with the number of greens depending on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-9.27147028982,12,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has an effect on the color output that follows its use. To deduce the rule that ""walm"" might be inducing, let's observe the outputs immediately after the word ""walm"" appears:

1. The output ""red red red"" follows the input that ends with ""walm.""
2. The output ""red red red"" follows the input that ends with ""wif walm.""
3. The output ""yellow blue yellow"" follows ""zup walm lug zup,"" but since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it suggests ""walm"" has no color and hence does not directly affect the color next to it.
4. The output ""red red red"" follows the input ending with ""wif walm.""
5. The output ""green green green"" follows the input ending with ""dax walm,"" where ""dax"" gives a single ""green.""

A pattern emerges that when ""walm"" is used, the color output that follows is a repetition of three of the previous color stated before ""walm."" In the case where ""walm"" is preceded by multiple colors (""zup walm lug zup""), it does not have an immediate tripling effect after it, suggesting that its rule is context-sensitive and it does not ""overwrite"" already defined color outputs.

In examples 2, 3, and 4, we see that ""lug"" directly translates to ""blue"" in the output, confirming that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Looking at example 1, ""lug"" is also followed by ""blue"" in the output. Again in example 5, ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" in the output.

The color outputs seem to correspond to presence and order of these nonce words in the input.

So the rule seems to be:
- ""dax"" -> green

dax -> green",-6.20670131362,13,dax
"To determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax"", let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
2. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow
3. Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow
4. Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
5. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue

We can start by noting that every input that starts with ""dax"" leads to an output that starts with ""green"". This is consistent across examples 1, 2, and 3. However, when ""dax"" is not the first word in the input, as in example 4, ""green"" is not the first color in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" at the beginning of the input prompts the output to begin with ""green"".

Next, let's consider the position of ""dax"" within the input:

- When ""dax"" appears first, ""green"" appears first.
- When ""dax"" appears last, as in example 4, ""green"" appears last.
- The other words that accompany ""dax"" also correlate with specific colors: 
  ""walm"" correlates with ""green"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

From this, we can deduce that ""dax"" indicates an ordering rule where its position in the input affects the position of ""green"" in the output, and it seems that ""dax"" itself may not have a meaning besides signifying that ordering rule.

However, since the problem specifies that ""dax"" is specifically the word whose meaning we need to deduce, and given that ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" in all examples irrespective of its position, it is reasonable to deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" with the positional rule also in effect.

"From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can analyze the consistent color it translates to in each output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
3. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green
4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green

Looking at the respective outputs where the word ""bluf"" appears, we see the following:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
3. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
5. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

In trying to find a pattern, we notice that the word ""bluf"" does not consistently map to the same color in output. Hence, there is likely a context-dependent rule here.

The rule appears to involve the position of ""bluf"" relative to the other words:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to ""blue"" in the second place.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color ""red.""
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""yellow.""
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" is the second word and corresponds to the second color ""red.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" is the third word and corresponds to the third color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it corresponds to the color that matches its position in the input. For example, if ""bluf"" is the second word, it outputs the color that is the rule for the second position.

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to its position in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is the nth word in the input, it outputs the color associated with the nth position.",-9.164373340546998,13,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must analyze how it modifies or interacts with the other words following it in the examples provided. The outputs seem to include only colors, and each example includes the word ""bluf"" at different places in the input sequence. We need to look at the color it corresponds to in each output to deduce the meaning.

Let's consider each instance where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" corresponds to blue here.

2. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   Since other words change from the previous output, and their corresponding colors change as well, we cannot confirm the color for ""bluf"" yet. However, it appears at the end of the sequence, so it likely takes on the last color, which is red. But we should keep analyzing to be sure.

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" and in the output, the color that follows yellow and precedes green is yellow.

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   ""bluf"" again corresponds to yellow, as it follows a ""zup.""

5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Again, ""bluf"" here corresponds to green, which follows after ""dax.""

From examining all the outputs, it seems ""bluf"" does not correspond to a fixed color. Instead, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. If we look at all the instances:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is yellow.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" in the first input sequence, the color for ""bluf"" is blue.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is green.
- The confusing occurrence of ""bluf"" correlating to red in second input can be an exception or indicates that the ""bluf"" might take the color of the last word in the sequence when placed at the end; however, this is just a speculation and not confirmed by the data provided.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the preceding word.

"To decipher the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red""
2. Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
3. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""wif walm zup"" -> Output: ""red red red yellow""
5. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at the inputs and corresponding outputs:

- The presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color before it.
- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" hence the triple ""red.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" still follows ""wif,"" and the output is still three ""reds"" in a row.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" corresponding to ""blue,"" leading to a triple ""blue.""
- In example 4, although ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the output has ""red"" repeated before the ""zup"" color ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows a second ""zup,"" so there are three ""yellows"" total, two for the ""zups,"" and one additional for ""walm.""

The rule for ""walm"" seems to be: Repeat the color of the word that comes before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",-0.593629413122,13,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word corresponds to a specific color, except for the nonce word ""walm,"" which seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times. Here are the associations I can make from the given data:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""bluf"" is not followed by ""walm,"" but from the context, we can guess it might correspond to the color yellow as well since it is sandwiched by ""zup,"" which is known to be yellow.

Now, applying this understanding to the appearances of ""walm,"" we observe:

- ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red""; ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" (red) thrice.
- ""zup wif walm lug"" includes a repetition of the red color followed by ""lug,"" which is blue.
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"" with ""walm"" repeating the blue color from ""lug"" three times.
- ""wif walm zup"" has ""walm"" repeating the red color from ""wif"" followed by the yellow color from ""zup.""
- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" contains a pattern where ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""bluf"" (presumably yellow, as described above), ""lug"" (blue), and another ""zup"" (yellow), with ""walm"" repeating the yellow color of the last ""zup"" mentioned.

Therefore, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the word that comes right before it, and it does this three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-4.77375185338,13,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns presented in the examples given.

1. In all examples, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of the same color. 
2. It appears that ""walm"" may be dependent on the word that comes before it. 

Let's break down each input and output pair:

- zup wif walm
  -- Output: yellow red red red
  -- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds after one red.

- zup wif walm lug
  -- Output: yellow red red red blue
  -- Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds after one red and then one blue after ""lug.""

- dax lug walm
  -- Output: green blue blue blue
  -- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is three blues after one blue.

- wif walm zup
  -- Output: red red red yellow
  -- ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds before yellow follows ""zup.""

- zup bluf lug zup walm
  -- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  -- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is three yellows after one yellow.

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word preceding it three times.

With this rule in mind, we can induce the following:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: duplication of the preceding color word three times.",-5.728870695617,13,walm

2. Input: zup wif walm lug  
Output: yellow red red red blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Notably, ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" outputs just like in the first example.

3. Input: dax lug walm  
Output: green blue blue blue

In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" still results in multiple ""blue"" entries.

4. Input: wif walm zup  
Output: red red red yellow

This time we see ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again seems to result in repeating the color corresponding to the word just before it.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" produces ""red,"" following the rule that ""wif"" also translates to ""red."" This time, ""dax"" follows and translates to ""green,"" supporting the first deduction.

"From the provided input-output examples, we can analyze the position of the nonce word ""zup"" and the corresponding output in the same position to deduce its meaning.

5. In the fifth example, ""lug"" outputs blue, ""bluf"" is followed by blue, and later again ""lug"" outputs blue, ""bluf"" is followed by blue.

It seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the value of the color corresponding to the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-0.9456918240400001,14,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" through the given input-output examples, we need to analyze the patterns and associations between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Let's look at each instance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output color:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> blue blue red blue blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- ""bluf"" appears with different words around it, so it is not dependent on a specific word to determine its output color.
- The output color for ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that occurs just before it in the input (if there is a word before it).

Looking at the examples given, the rule seems to be that the color associated with the word ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the preceding word in the input string.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the input sequence.

So, the meaning of ""bluf"" in the context of these inputs and outputs is:

bluf -> takes the color of the previous word in the input sequence.",-1.29944158457,14,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to correspond to the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

Input 1: zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) dax (green)
Output 1: yellow yellow green

Input 2: dax (green) lug (blue) bluf (blue) wif (red)
Output 2: green blue blue red

Input 3: zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red red red)
Output 3: yellow yellow red red red

Output 4: green green yellow

Input 5: lug (blue) bluf (blue) wif (red) lug (blue) bluf (blue) zup (yellow)
Output 5: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

"bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples, each word appears to correlate with a specific color: 
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow 
- ""dax"" correlates with green 
- ""lug"" correlates with blue 
- ""wif"" correlates with red 
- ""walm"" appears to correlate with a repetition of the previous color, in this case red repeated thrice.

Given this pattern, ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color of the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it in the sequence.",-5.2325353558400005,14,bluf
"Based on the examples, we can deduce that the color corresponding to ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in yellow. 
2. In ""dax lug bluf wif"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in blue.
3. In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""bluf"" still follows ""zup"" and results in yellow.
4. In ""dax bluf zup"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in green.
5. In ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"", the first ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" resulting in blue and the second ""bluf"" also follows ""lug"" and still results in blue.

From this, we can deduce the following rule: 

Rule: The color output for ""bluf"" is determined by the color associated with the word that comes right before ""bluf"". If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", it results in yellow. If ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", it results in blue. If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", it results in green. 

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" could be stated as:

bluf -> The color output is dependent on the word immediately preceding ""bluf"":
- If the preceding word is ""zup"", the color is yellow.
- If the preceding word is ""lug"", the color is blue.
- If the preceding word is ""dax"", the color is green.",-8.8439569271,14,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondences in each of the contexts it appears:

1. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue""
4. ""lug dax walm"" -> ""blue green green green""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

We can attempt to identify a pattern based on the associated output colors for each input that contains ""walm.""

Considering that the color before ""walm"" is repeated one more time after ""walm,"" and the color representing ""walm"" itself is blue, we can hypothesize the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the previous color once and then add blue.

Checking this rule with the examples:

1. ""lug walm"" has ""lug"" represented by blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, giving us ""green blue blue blue"" (with ""dax"" represented by green).
3. For ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug,"" ""lug"" is represented by blue, hence after ""bluf,"" it repeats blue once and then adds blue, resulting in the sequence ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" (with ""wif"" represented by red, ""zup"" by yellow, ""bluf"" by blue, and ""dax"" by green).
4. ""lug dax walm"" has ""dax"" represented by green, so after ""lug,"" it repeats green once and then adds blue, resulting in ""blue green green green.""
5. Finally, in ""dax lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" is blue, so it repeats blue once and then adds blue, which provides us with ""green blue blue blue yellow red"" (with ""zup"" represented by yellow and ""wif"" by red).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color once and then add blue.",-1.117375089802,14,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the previous word the number of times of the total words preceding ""walm"". 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and there's one word before ""walm,"" hence ""blue"" is repeated once: ""blue blue blue."" 
- In the second example, ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" with two words before ""walm,"" thus generating ""green blue blue blue"" (repeating ""blue"" two times after ""green"").
- In the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not associated with a color directly, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" with four words before ""walm,"" so we only consider the color-generating words leading to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue blue""(""blue"" is repeated four times, after ""red yellow yellow"").
- The fourth example is similar to the first two with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" and now there are two words before ""walm,"" so ""blue"" gets repeated twice after ""green"": ""blue green green green.""
- The fifth example includes ""dax"" (green), ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), and ""wif"" (red), with four words before ""walm,"" leading to: ""green blue blue blue yellow red.""

Thus, walm -> meaning: A command to repeat the color of the previous word the number of times equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"".",-3.1374524242139996,14,walm
"walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times. Rule: The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the number of letters in the word immediately preceding ""walm"". For example:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" has three letters, so ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" has three letters, so ""blue"" is repeated three times after the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" has ""lug walm"" within the sequence, producing ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm"" and continuing the pattern with the rest of the words.
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green"" because ""dax"" has three letters, so ""green"" is repeated three times after the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" has ""lug walm"" within the sequence, producing ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm"" and continuing with ""zup"" and ""wif"" afterwards.",-6.061183064420001,14,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the consistent patterns in the input and output.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on this information, ""walm"" seems to correspond to an output that is a repetition of the color before it. The number of times the color is repeated also seems to depend on the position of ""walm"" in the sequence:

1. When ""lug walm"" is in the input, the output is ""blue blue blue"" - lug corresponds to blue, and it's repeated two more times because of walm.
2. When ""dax lug walm"" is in the input, ""green blue blue blue"" is in the output - dax corresponds to green, lug to blue, and the last blue is repeated again because of walm.
3. In the input ""lug dax walm"", the output is ""blue green green green"" - again lug corresponds to blue, dax to green, and the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times due to walm, while disregarding the initial blue from lug.
4. In a more complex string, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", the output ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"" shows that walm makes a triple repetition of the color before it, which is blue, hence ""blue blue blue"".

This pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times, taking the place of ""walm"", and any color word that follows it does not affect this repetition.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the preceding color word to repeat three times in the output.",-7.771900300647999,14,walm
"Rule: ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color word that follows the word ""lug"". Each instance of ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and then by a series of the color ""blue"" repeated. The number of repetitions of ""blue"" is one more than the number of ""dax"" words that precede ""lug"".

- No ""dax"" before ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (3 blues)
- One ""dax"" before ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue"" (4 blues)
- One ""dax"" before and one ""dax"" after ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue"" (still 4 blues, as the second ""dax"" is after ""lug"").
- One ""dax"" before and two ""lug"" in sequence with ""walm"" (as in ""dax lug walm dax lug"") lead to ""green blue blue blue"" and ""green blue"" separated by the color sequence for ""dax"", which suggests that the repetition rule is reset after ""walm"" is completed.

Thus, the rule seems to be:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns and associations between the inputs and the outputs.

In the first example:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

- The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" both times it appears.
- The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""

In the second example:
Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

- The word ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- Here ""lug"" again is associated with ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" at the end is associated with ""yellow,"" which is the same color associated with ""zup.""

In the third example:
Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""red,"" which is the color associated with the preceding word ""wif.""

In the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue

- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is again associated with ""red,"" consistent with the preceding word ""wif.""
- ""lug"" remains associated with ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red

- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""bluf"" is associated with ""green,"" which is the same color as the preceding word ""dax.""
- The final ""wif"" is again associated with ""red.""

Taking into account these observations, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word immediately before it.",-6.084784571511,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with a certain color, which is determined by the color that comes before it. Below are observations from the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is blue.
3. When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" the output is green.
4. When ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" the output is yellow.

So, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color that precedes it in the sequence. Here is the rule based on the deduced meaning:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.",-6.12778055608,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color output in the sequence. By comparing the input and output of each line, you can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". 

In all given examples, whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output is either ""blue"" or ""red."" However, it's not consistent with one color, further observation is that the color right before ""bluf"" is repeated immediately after it. Let's substantiate this pattern with the given examples:

- In the first example (Input: wif bluf lug dax wif), ""bluf"" is positioned after a ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") and the output at the position of ""bluf"" is ""red"" again. 
- The second example (Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf) does not adhere to the repeated color assumption because ""bluf"" here would correspond to ""yellow"", yet there is a recognizable pattern that the last color seems to be repeated which is ""yellow"" here. 
- The third example (Input: zup wif bluf) follows the rule, where ""bluf"" follows a ""wif"" and again corresponds to ""red"".
- The fourth example (Input: wif bluf lug) again demonstrates that after ""wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth example (Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif), ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and instead of corresponding to the expected ""green,"" it results in ""green"" again, which is a repetition of ""dax"".

It appears the rule for ""bluf"" is that it mimics the color of the preceding word. However, the second example showcases an exception where ""bluf"" is the last word and does not have a preceding color yet turns out to be ""yellow"". Given this inconsistency, it might be aligned with the specific rule that when ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence with no preceding color, it defaults to ""yellow"". 

Therefore, the tentative rule considering all examples is:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, unless it appears at the end of a sequence and has no preceding color, in which case it is ""yellow"".

So the meaning could be summarized as:

bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word; default to ""yellow"" if there is no preceding color.",-7.0281428400240005,15,bluf
"Observing the given examples, we can find correlations between the input words and the colors in the output. These correlations could indicate that the words correspond to specific colors. Let's examine the input-output pairs:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" directly corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" correlates with the last ""yellow,"" but here it seems to follow the pattern that the color repeats the one directly before ""bluf,"" as there is no ""blue"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" correlates again with a repeated ""red,"" the color associated with the word ""wif"" just before it.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""blue"" once more.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second instance of ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax"" just before it.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes immediately before it, when that word has a color associated with it. If the word before ""bluf"" does not have a color associated with it, ""bluf"" defaults to blue.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word before it, if that word has an associated color; otherwise, blue.",-8.7219693996,15,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> red when following the word wif, and blue when following the word lug. It seems to adopt the color attributed to the word immediately preceding it when that color is either red or blue. However, if it is not preceded by wif or lug, as seen in the second example, where it stands alone at the end, it defaults to yellow, which might be its inherent color when not influenced by preceding words.",-9.41573666008,15,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output of the subsequent words up to the next occurrence of the word ""dax"" or up to the end of the input if ""dax"" does not appear again.

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

- When ""walm"" is introduced after ""wif,"" all subsequent colors repeated the same as the one immediately following ""walm"" until the input string ends or a new rule word appears. For example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" (Example 1), and ""zup walm wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (Example 5).
- When ""walm"" appears on its own or at the end of the string without a ""dax"" later in the sequence, all colors following are the same until the end of the string, such as ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue"" (Example 3).
- If ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the color ""green"" continues until a ""lug"" or a new ""dax"" appears or until the end of the input string (Example 4: ""dax walm zup lug dax"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue green"").

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> causes the next color word to repeat its output for all following words until either ""dax"" appears again or the input sequence ends. If ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" then ""green"" repeats instead.",-4.964729946744,15,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it, turning it into multiples of that color. 

In every example, the appearance of ""walm"" resulted in the repetition of the color indicated by the word that precedes it. 

1. ""bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow red"" is followed by ""red red"" indicating that ""walm"" repeated the red color of ""wif"".
2. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" shows that ""walm"" repeated the color of ""zup"" two more times before moving on to ""wif"" which changed the color to red.
3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"" indicates that ""walm"" repeated the color of ""lug"" two more times.
4. ""dax walm zup"" -> ""green green green"" indicates that ""walm"" repeated the color of ""dax"" two more times before the color changed with the next word ""zup"".
5. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" shows that ""walm"" repeated the color of ""zup"" two more times before changing to ""wif"" which is red.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the occurrences of ""walm"" in the provided examples and the associated outputs.

- In the first example (Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm), ""walm"" corresponds to a series of reds, but it occurs after a series of colors that are already established: green, red, yellow. Notably, ""wif"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red.""

- In the second example (Input: dax zup walm wif), ""walm"" occurs after ""green"" and ""yellow"" and results in ""yellow,"" followed later by ""wif,"" which produces ""red.""

- In the third example (Input: lug walm), ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in three instances of ""blue.""

- In the fourth example (Input: dax walm zup lug dax), ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to two more instances of ""green,"" followed by ""yellow"" from ""zup,"" ""blue"" from ""lug,"" and ""green"" from another ""dax.""

- In the fifth example (Input: zup walm wif), ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow,"" and is followed by ""wif,"" which gives ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word before ""walm."" For instance, ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" and more greens, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" and more blues, and ""zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm"" and more yellows. It's notable that the color repeats a number of times, which seems to be three in the third example, but varies depending on the context in others.

Rule: walm -> causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word a certain number of times. The number of repetitions might be dependent on other words present or the immediate context.",-6.357462318794001,15,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. To demonstrate:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which translates to the color red, and the sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which translates to the color yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which translates to the color blue, and the output is ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which translates to the color green, and the output is ""green green green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" which translates to the color yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the word before it to repeat three times.

So the rule is:

walm -> Causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat three times.",-6.841596425586,15,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we first need to compare the inputs and outputs to understand the patterns and correlations.

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: The outcome of ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correlates to specific colors (green, red, and yellow). Since the pattern repeats consistently for these words, we can assume that each has a fixed meaning. The word ""walm"" at the end of the sequence corresponds to triple ""red.""

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: In this case, after ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which mean green and yellow, respectively, ""walm"" turns the next color to three repetitions of yellow.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: Here, the word ""lug"" results in a single blue, followed by ""walm,"" which again results in a triple repetition of the color (blue).

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Analysis: Regardless of the preceding word (""dax""), ""walm"" leads to a repetition of green three times. It seems that ""walm"" is causing a tripling effect on the last mentioned color.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Analysis: Following the previous rules, ""zup"" results in yellow. Then ""walm"" causes yellow to repeat two more times, followed by ""wif"" changing the color to red.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated two additional times, creating a sequence of three of the same color.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided. Each example includes the word ""dax"" alongside other words, each of which corresponds to a color in the output.

Observing the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm wif zup"" -> ""green green green red yellow""
2. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue""
3. ""wif dax wif"" -> ""red green red""
4. ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
5. ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""

In every instance where ""dax"" is used, the corresponding color in the output is ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words around it, it consistently results in the color ""green"" in the output. This consistent mapping suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

Based on this analysis, we have the rule:

"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output. Here is how we can reach that conclusion:

Example 1:
- lug dax bluf -> blue green green
Since lug results in blue, and dax results in green, bluf must correspond to the second green.

Example 2:
- zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
We know dax is green, and zup is yellow. Since bluf appears between yellow and blue, and between blue and green, and we have confirmed earlier that dax is green, we can infer that bluf corresponds to the first green. This is consistent with the previous example.

Example 3:
- dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
dax is green, zup is yellow, and lug is blue. With bluf following a known green and preceding a known red, it translates once more to green.

Example 4 & 5:
- In both cases, bluf follows dax (which we've established as green), and in both outputs, the word that follows green is also green. This also holds true in previous examples where bluf is followed by a color that is not green, so its translation does not seem to be dependent on the following word.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must analyze its usage in the given examples and look for patterns in relation to the output provided.

- Example 1: dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
  In sequence: green (dax), green (walm), green (zup), yellow (lug), blue (walm).
  The word ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" in these cases and results in ""green"" in the first instance and ""blue"" in the second.

- Example 2: wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
  No direct antecedent can be observed as ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, producing ""blue.""

- Example 3: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
  ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and leads to ""blue,"" ""dax"" precedes and follows ""walm"" leading to a sequence of two different colors.

- Example 4: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
  ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""

- Example 5: zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
  ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and leads to ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" carries the same color as the word that precedes it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color is green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color is red.

There is no example where ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""bluf,"" so we cannot confirm the output for these cases.

Rule: walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, the deduced rule is: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word.",-0.973796362438,16,walm
"Based on the given examples, walm seems to be associated with a pattern of colors that follows its placement in the input sequence. To deduce the meaning of walm, we need to analyze the examples and determine what colors are produced when walm is present.

Let's look at each example:

1. ""dax walm zup lug walm""
   - ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   - After ""walm"", green is followed by yellow, and then blue is repeated, possibly three times due to the presence of ""lug"" and ""walm"" again.

2. ""wif zup bluf lug walm""
   - ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""
   - Here ""walm"" follows ""lug"" producing three blues.

3. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   - ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   - In this sequence, ""lug walm"" results in three blues.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm""
   - ""yellow yellow red red red""
   - Following ""walm"" we see red repeated three times.

5. ""zup wif dax walm lug""
   - ""yellow red green green green blue""
   - Here ""walm"" is succeeded by three greens and then a blue due to ""lug"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" is not directly associated with a single color but rather it seems to cause the preceding color to be repeated three times. The color that follows ""walm"" might be influenced by other words following it, like ""lug"" in the first and fifth examples which is associated with blue after ""walm"".

Rule:
walm -> Causes the preceding color to be repeated three times. If followed by ""lug"", the sequence is ended with a blue.",-1.112873061538,16,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

1. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
2. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue
3. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

Considering the color outputs after the word ""walm"" in various contexts, the word ""walm"" seems to relate to the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color to be the repeated occurrence of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm,"" except in the first instance where ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" the color is blue, potentially indicating a starting point or reset. However, the last example demonstrates that ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in a single occurrence of blue, possibly due to the chaining effect at the end of the sequence without further repetitions required.

Using this rule, the meaning of ""walm"" can be inferred as an instruction to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

walm -> meaning. Rule: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, with the exception that if ""lug"" immediately follows ""walm,"" the color is blue (with variations in the number of repetitions, possibly due to the position in the sequence).",-1.2972286977979999,16,walm
"Analyzing the patterns in which the nonce word ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs provided, we can try to deduce the rule for ""walm.""

- In the first example, the word ""walm"" corresponds to two colors: ""blue blue blue."" 
- In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" again, maintaining the threefold repetition of the color blue.
- In the third example, ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" once more.
- The fourth example again has ""walm"" corresponding to a trio of the color red: ""red red red.""
- In the final example, ""walm"" is translated into ""green green green.""

Now let's observe the patterns concerning the other words:
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color green.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" has an output of blue.
- ""wif"" seems to align with the color red.
- ""bluf"" leads to yellow in one instance and red in the other.

Considering ""walm"" results in a triple repetition of color, we can notice that it follows the color of the word before it, creating a triplet:

- When ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" (red) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
- When ""dax"" (green) comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, in a set of three.

Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word repeated three times.",-10.844929980699998,16,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs for each example.

1. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   
In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" The word ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and before ""zup,"" and the output is ""green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" may be repeating the color output associated with the word that comes before it. After ""lug,"" the word ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" which supports this hypothesis.

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct output, and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we again see the color ""blue"" is repeated twice, aligning with the established pattern of duplicating the output color of the preceding word.

3. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   
In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output ""blue"" is duplicated. This further supports the earlier hypothesis.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" again has no direct output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" follows ""wif"" with the output ""red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" is, once again, duplicating the color of the preceding word.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
Similar patterns hold, where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green,"" reinforcing the rule.

4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

In examples 1, 2, and 3, the color that follows ""bluf"" matches the color assigned to the word immediately following ""bluf"" in the input. In example 4, the word ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the matching output colors are yellow and blue, among which blue follows ""bluf."" Example 5 also confirms that ""bluf"" is followed by blue when the next word is ""zup.""

It seems like ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the next color,"" but we notice that ""bluf"" itself is associated with a color in the output as well, which is consistent whenever ""bluf"" appears:

- In the first position after ""bluf"" in the output: red, yellow, green, yellow, blue
- The corresponding color of ""bluf"" in the preceding word: dax (green), zup (yellow), dax (green), zup (yellow), lug (blue)

In these examples, the color preceding ""bluf"" is the same as the color that represents ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it and commands the next word to repeat its color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word and the following word's color in the output.",-1.061818327944,17,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze how it correlates with the output colors in the examples provided:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
3. dax bluf lug wif -> green green blue red
4. zup lug zup bluf lug -> yellow blue yellow yellow blue
5. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

Looking at the patterns:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" and ""walm"" to green, and ""bluf"" also corresponds to red.
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" produces the same color as ""zup,"" yellow.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and again, ""bluf"" produces the same color as ""dax,"" green.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, we see that ""bluf"" matches the color of the first word in both ""zup"" (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue).

Based on these examples, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color associated with the word that directly follows it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the color associated with the word that immediately follows it.",-1.233627952682,17,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each input and corresponding output alongside each other:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green 
   
   Here ""wif"" relates to ""red,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" relate to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is also related to ""red.""

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow 
   
   Here ""zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" relates to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is related to ""yellow.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red 
   
   Here ""dax"" relates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is related to ""green.""

4. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue 
   
   Here ""zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is related to ""yellow.""

5. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue 
   
   Here ""lug"" relates to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is related to ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Whenever ""bluf"" follows a word, it assumes the same color associated with that word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-6.211673002401,17,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. wif corresponds to red.
2. dax corresponds to green.
3. zup corresponds to yellow.
4. lug corresponds to blue.

In each instance where bluf appears, it takes the color of the word preceding it. For example:

- In ""wif bluf dax walm"", bluf follows wif and thus takes the output ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf lug zup"", bluf follows zup and thus takes the output ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf lug wif"", bluf follows dax and thus takes the output ""green.""
- In ""zup lug zup bluf lug"", bluf follows zup and therefore has the output ""yellow."" 
- In ""lug bluf zup lug"", bluf follows lug, so its output is ""blue.""

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be that bluf takes the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word that precedes it. If it's the first word, the rule cannot be determined based on the provided examples.",-7.3984388574899995,17,bluf
"Observing the patterns from the given examples:

1. When ""wif"" is presented, the output is ""red.""
2. When ""dax"" is presented, the output is ""green.""
3. When ""zup"" is presented, the output is ""yellow.""
4. When ""lug"" is presented, the output is ""blue.""

In every case, the presence of ""bluf"" in the input results in the next word adopting its corresponding color as the output, repeated for the number of times equivalent to the position of ""bluf."" That is, if ""bluf"" is the second word in the sequence, the following word's color is output twice.

For example:
- In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" is the second word, so ""dax"" ('green') is output twice.
- In ""zup bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" is the second word, so ""lug"" ('blue') is output twice.
- In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" ""bluf"" is the second word, so ""lug"" ('blue') is output twice.
- When ""bluf"" comes at the end of a sequence (""zup lug zup bluf lug""), it doesn't cause a repetition because there is no word after ""bluf"" to apply the rule to.

This indicates the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears, it causes the color corresponding to the following word to be outputted an additional number of times equal to the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end, the last word before ""bluf"" has its color repeated as many times as the position of ""bluf."" 

Therefore, based on the examples given and the rule deduced:

bluf -> causes the following word's corresponding color to be repeated based on the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence. If ""bluf"" is at the end, the previous word's color is repeated instead.",-7.533004213320001,17,bluf
"By analyzing the input-output patterns, it seems that the appearance of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. More specifically, after a ""walm"" is introduced, the color of the preceding word is repeated three times.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. In ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green.""
4. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green.""
5. In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" you see ""green green green."" Then the pattern resumes normally with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-8.34151013912,17,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine each example and identify any patterns associated with the word in question.

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   
4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue

Analyzing the examples:

- Every time ""dax"" appears, it translates to ""green.""  
- Every time ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue.""  
- Every time ""zup"" appears, it translates to ""yellow.""  
- In each example, the output color sequence is either starting or resumed after ""walm"" is exactly the same as the sequence immediately before ""walm"".  
- It's important to note that ""walm"" does not seem to have a direct one-to-one color association like the other words do.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it indicates a repetition of the color sequence immediately preceding it.

Let's verify this by looking at each example:

1. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

2. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

4. Input: dax lug wif bluf

5. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   The word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" is also ""red"".

Taking all of the above into account, the rule that can be induced is:

"Examining the given examples, we can infer a pattern of association between the nonce words and color words in the outputs. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look for its corresponding output in each example:

2. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
3. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue

Here are the observations:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, the output color sequence contains one additional ""green"" after ""walm"" is introduced.
- In example 2, ""walm"" is before ""zup"" and the output for both is ""green"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" leads to three ""red"" in the output.

From these observations, we can derive the following rule:

Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color it corresponds to repeats the color of the word directly preceding it.

Rule: walm -> the color of the preceding word repeated.",-1.291410731614,18,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to translate to the color that is mentioned immediately prior to ""walm"". Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue"". ""Lug"" appears to mean blue, and ""walm"" directly follows, also translating to blue.
- In the second example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green"". ""Dax"" seems to mean green, and ""walm"" directly follows, translating to green as well.
- In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"". ""Dax"" is green, followed by ""walm,"" which again is green, and then ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"". ""Lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red but not immediately followed by ""walm"", ""walm"" follows after and it translates to red matching ""wif"".
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm"" within the sequence translates to ""blue blue."" And the ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue,"" again showing ""walm"" taking the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" translates into the color of the word that is directly before it. If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug"" which translates to blue, then ""walm"" translates to blue. If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax"" which translates to green, then ""walm"" translates to green, and so on.",-7.46239924687,18,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repeating pattern of colors related to the preceding word. Specifically, ""walm"" appears to result in the output being the same color as the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" 

Let's examine the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" takes on the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green,"" with ""walm"" taking the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
3. In the third example, ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue,"" where ""walm"" again mimics the color of ""dax,"" which is green, before the pattern continues with ""lug"" in blue.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" with ""walm"" taking the color of ""wif"" (which is red) for all subsequent colors.
5. In the fifth example, again we see ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" consistent with the idea that ""walm"" matches the color of ""lug.""

3. However, the number of times ""green"" appears corresponds to the number of words that follow ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by one word (""wif""), and ""green"" appears once in the output after ""walm"" is used.

- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two words (""zup wif""), and two ""green"" follow in the output after ""walm"" is used.

"Based on the provided input-output pairs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup."" To do this, we will look for patterns in the outputs that correspond to the appearance of ""zup"" in the inputs.

Reviewing the examples:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- There are no instances where ""zup"" leads to any other color in the output.
- The output color for the other words present (lug, walm, dax, wif, bluf) varies, but ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on this pattern, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-6.723025798714,19,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup lug walm

2. Input: dax zup

3. Input: zup lug
   Output: yellow blue
   
4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
5. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

Now let's analyze the occurrences of ""zup"" in the inputs and the consistent element in the outputs.

In every instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output sequences. No matter the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, ""yellow"" always follows in the output. ""Zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" while other words correspond to their own color associations, as inferred from the repeated occurrences within the examples provided.

"Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""",-6.826057811939999,19,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each pair of input-output examples:

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
Here, ""dax"" is mapped to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and yields another ""yellow,"" this could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, but more evidence is needed.

2. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
In this example, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again maps to ""red."" Following this pattern, ""bluf"" is used after ""lug"" and results in another ""blue."" This further supports the idea that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word right before it.

3. wif bluf lug -> red red blue
In this case, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""lug"" comes after and is ""blue."" Again, the color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word preceding it, which is ""red.""

4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
""Zup"" is mapped to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the color of ""bluf"" is ""red"" again, matching the color of ""wif"" that appears just before it.

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" and so is ""bluf,"" which could suggest that ""bluf"" is indeed ""yellow"" in this case. However, this is consistent with the previous examples if we consider ""bluf"" to be taking the color of the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-0.8649284136720002,19,bluf
"To understand the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let us look at each provided input-output pair and search for patterns:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - 'dax' maps to 'green'
   - 'wif' maps to 'red'
   - 'zup' maps to 'yellow'

2. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   - 'lug' maps to 'blue'

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - The positions of 'wif' and 'lug' swapped from the previous example, but their corresponding colors did not change.

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - Here, 'zup' still corresponds to yellow and 'wif' to red

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - 'zup' corresponds to yellow again.

When the word ""bluf"" appears, the color repeated in the output is always the color corresponding to the word just before it. If this pattern holds consistently across these examples, we can infer that ""bluf"" likely refers to repeating the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.",-5.388868125720999,19,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule governing the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".

Explanation of the rule:
- In the first example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug"" is before ""bluf"", and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", and ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" results in red.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf"" again with no other words between them, resulting in ""bluf"" being yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately before it.",-6.262570880932,19,bluf
"Considering the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on its context within the sequence. We can deduce a rule based on the patterns observed:

- When ""bluf"" follows a repeated word such as ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" it takes on the color of the word following its pair (in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and since ""dax"" is repeated before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is yellow).
  
- When ""bluf"" immediately follows a word without repetition, such as ""zup bluf"" or ""wif bluf,"" it matches the color of the preceding word (""zup"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow; ""wif"" is red, so ""bluf"" is red).
  
- When there is no word for ""bluf"" to refer back to or when ""bluf"" is positioned after a word that has not appeared earlier, ""bluf"" takes the color red, as seen in the ""wif bluf lug"" and ""zup wif bluf"" examples.

Therefore, the general rule we can establish is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word if it has already appeared in the sequence. If there is no preceding matched word, ""bluf"" becomes red. 

Following this rule, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent:

bluf -> The color of the preceding word in the sequence if such a word has appeared earlier, otherwise red.",-8.1186068549,19,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. In each example, the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color assigned to the word right before it. There is no example where ""bluf"" stands alone at the beginning of a sequence to test what color it would default to without a preceding word. Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to act as a mirror or copy for the color of the preceding word.

"walm -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word.

   Output: ""green blue blue blue""
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue""
   - ""walm"" following ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times (assuming ""lug"" has one syllable).

2. ""dax walm""

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup

   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""walm"" translates to ""red""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red""
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" (note the difference from the second example)

From these points, we can discern that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. However, there is an inconsistency with the word ""bluf,"" as it translates to ""red"" in the second example but to ""yellow"" in the fifth example. This inconsistency is not directly related to our task of defining ""wif,"" but it's an anomaly worth mentioning.

Input: wif walm dax zup

From analyzing the pairs, it seems like ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Let's validate this by checking each example:

- The second word in the first input is ""wif,"" and the second color in the output is ""red.""
- The first word in the second input is ""wif,"" and the first color in the output is ""red.""
- The first word in the third input is ""wif,"" and the first color in the output is ""red.""
- The second word in the fourth input is ""wif,"" and the second color in the output is ""red.""

Analyzing the position and output of ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug"", the output is ""red blue"" (example 5),
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", ""walm"", or ""dax"", the output is ""red red"" (example 2 and 3),
- When ""wif"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow red"" (example 4).

"Based on the input and output examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the word ""bluf"":

- ""bluf"" on its own translates to yellow (as seen in ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").

- ""bluf"" does not seem to have a standalone meaning but affects the word preceding it, turning the output of that word to green.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it changes the color associated with the word immediately before it to green if there is a word before it, or to yellow if it is the first or only word.

Rule: bluf -> if there is a preceding word, change the preceding word's output to green; if ""bluf"" is the first or only word, the output is yellow.",-3.50412443974,20,bluf

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Again, here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red red.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" but we have to consider that ""green green"" could be the result of both ""dax"" and ""bluf.""

Input: zup bluf

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but given previous examples, it's clear that ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which falls in line with the third input, suggesting that both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" can result in ""green.""

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""

Based on these observations, we can formulate the rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns associated with its appearances and the outputs:

1. Input: dax wif bluf   Output: green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" must correspond to the second ""red"".

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" does not correspond to ""green"" so it's another ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""wif bluf"" together lead to ""red red"".

3. Input: wif zup dax bluf   Output: red yellow green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""bluf"" would correlate with the second ""green"".

4. Input: zup bluf   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to the second ""yellow"".

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf   Output: blue red blue green green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", resulting in another ""green"".

- When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the output is green again.
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output is yellow again.
- ""Bluf"" never appears directly after ""wif"" or ""lug,"" so we don't see a repeat of ""red"" or ""blue"" associated directly with ""bluf.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" implying that ""walm"" means repeat the ""blue"" thrice.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""lug walm"" again leads to ""blue blue blue,"" further supporting the repetition rule, and ""dax"" then adds ""green"" after the repetition.

1. ""dax lug wif walm"": The color ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif,"" and ""walm"" appears once. This suggests that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word (""wif"" -> red) to be repeated once.

2. ""lug walm"": The color ""blue"" is output three times, which is the color associated with ""lug,"" and ""walm"" appears once. Hence, again ""walm"" results in repeating ""lug""'s color three times.

3. ""lug walm dax"": The output is ""blue blue blue green,"" which behaviorally is consistent with ""walm"" causing the color for ""lug"" to be repeated three times, followed by the color for ""dax"" (green).

4. ""dax zup walm wif walm"": This pattern results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" ""Walm"" repeats ""zup""'s color (yellow) three times and then also repeats ""wif""'s color (red) three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be: repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" the same number of times that ""walm"" has been said consecutively.

"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we look for patterns in the corresponding outputs:

- ""wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""red red yellow""
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""

First, consider what happens to the words around ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both translate to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""bluf,"" both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""red.""

These examples suggest that ""wif"" does something to the word that follows it, turning it into ""red.""

There's an exception to consider in the second example: ""wif dax zup walm"" becomes ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" which turns into ""green"" rather than ""red."" This suggests that the rule for ""wif"" might not apply when another color (like ""green"" in this case) follows.

One possible interpretation of ""wif"" could then be that it makes the following word replicate the color before it, except when the original color of the following word is ""green."" This could explain why ""dax"" remains ""green"" following ""wif,"" as green might be an exception to the replication.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the assumption that ""wif"" makes the following word replicate the color before it doesn't hold up. There is no previous color before ""wif"" in ""zup wif,"" but ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" Therefore, we must refine our rule.

When ""wif"" is present, it consistently corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in all examples.

In conclusion, ""wif"" itself means red. The presence of ""wif"" has no direct discernible impact on the adjacent words to alter their corresponding colors, except that when ""bluf"" appears next to ""wif,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" which might be a special rule for the pair ""wif bluf.""

Rule: wif -> red.",-1.281320387988,21,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns for the nonce word ""wif"" and the associated colors:

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""wif"" follows with ""red"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"", which is repeated, seems to extend the ""yellow"" output.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" that follows is ""red"".

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

In this input, the sequence is consistent with previous examples where ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" extends the ""yellow"" sequence, ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" yields ""red red"".

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

Again, ""zup"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"".

By examining the inputs and outputs, we can see whenever ""wif"" appears, the output color is ""red"". Therefore, we can conclude the meaning of ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"".

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" is translated as ""red"" when it comes after the term ""wif."" When ""bluf"" appears sandwiched between two identical words, it is also translated as ""red."" Here are the observations:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red.""
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf wif"" maps to ""green green red."" This could suggest that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that follows it.
3. In the third example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""blue red red,"" which again shows ""bluf"" mapping to ""red"" after ""wif.""
4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" maps to ""red red,"" which is consistent with the previous instances of ""wif bluf.""
5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" is simply ""red red.""

However, there is an inconsistency in the third input: ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red,"" but according to the pattern observed before, ""wif bluf"" should translate to ""blue red."" Since it translates to ""blue red red,"" we can deduce that the context of the word before ""bluf"" plays a role, as ""walm"" does not appear in any other example, and its output is ""blue,"" which is different from ""lug"" and ""wif"" which result in a repeated color output.

Given this, and because the examples are limited, a definitive rule for ""bluf"" cannot be established with certainty, but according to the data provided, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it appears after the word ""wif.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" when it comes after ""wif"" or between two identical words.",-4.230423328660001,21,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems like the word ""bluf"" is translated to the color ""red."" This is evident from the consistent Output that follows the word ""bluf"" with the color ""red."" 

However, it is important to note that in the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""red"" twice, which might suggest that the rule includes duplicating the color that follows.

"Using the examples provided, we can determine that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color implied by the word preceding it. Here's how we deduce that:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" outputs ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" has caused ""yellow"" to repeat.

- In the second example, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and results in ""red"" being repeated two more times.

- In the third example, ""zup wif walm"" is translated into ""yellow red red red."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which means ""red"") and causes the output to exhibit a repetition of ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue."" The ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which means ""blue,"" resulting in three additional ""blue"" outputs.

- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""blue"") and repeats it three more times.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" induces a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it, creating a sequence of three additional colors of the same kind.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color implied by the word before it to repeat three more times in the output.",-0.959782046388,21,walm
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to correlate with repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. Here is the deduction:

1. ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" translates to ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"". Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the color corresponding to ""zup"".

2. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"". In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", and the output is ""red red red"", indicating ""walm"" leads to a triple repetition of the color corresponding to ""wif"".

3. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"", represented by ""red"", and the output includes three additional instances of ""red"" after the original ""wif"".

4. ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"", represented by ""blue"", and the output is three instances of ""blue"" following the original ""lug"".

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"", which again is ""blue"", and the output is three instances of ""blue"" after the original ""lug"".

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""Walm"" results in three repetitions of the color of the word that precedes it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" according to the rule deduced from the examples is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-1.2161258392019998,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify patterns in the input-output pairs. We see that distinct words in the input map to specific colors in the output:

- ""wif"" maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""

Now let's look at the outputs immediately following ""walm"":
- After ""walm,"" the color that follows is the same color as the word preceding ""walm."" For instance, in ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" which is the color associated with the word ""zup,"" the word right before ""walm.""
- The number of repeated colors after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of colors in the output before ""walm,"" excluding the color that is to be repeated. For example, in ""wif walm,"" there is one ""red"" before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" is followed by 3 ""red,"" making it a total of 4 ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to repeat three times in the output, with the total number of colors after ""walm"" (including the repeated one) being one greater than the total number of unique colors before ""walm."" 

Therefore:

walm -> causes the preceding color to repeat three times with the total count of that color after ""walm"" being one greater than the number of unique colors before it.",-6.0652800100699995,21,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's compare the inputs and outputs to see how the word ""walm"" changes the sequence of colors in the output.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that comes before ""walm"" is repeated three times. For instance:
   - ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" has ""zup"" before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is three times the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"" (in this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"").
   - In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the ""walm"" causes the output ""red red red.""
   
2. There's no example with ""walm"" followed by another word, so it's not clear how or if ""walm"" affects subsequent words.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output.

- ""walm"" always produces the output ""blue""

- Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- There is a one-to-one correspondence between instances of ""dax"" and ""green"".
- The word ""dax"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other words (e.g., ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"" to ""red"").

From these observations, it appears that the presence of ""dax"" in the input directly corresponds to the appearance of ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green.",-6.360939678682,22,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the pattern between the input and output for each example.

1. Input: dax zup

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax

3. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   Every ""dax"" matches with ""green."" The repeating pattern suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" also translates to ""blue.""

4. Input: lug dax lug wif

5. Input: wif zup wif dax

Rule: dax -> green",-9.14187743484,22,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

- When ""lug walm wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue red red."" The word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to two reds at the end of the sequence, suggesting that ""wif"" may correspond to red since it also precedes ""bluf.""

- When ""wif lug"" is input, the output is ""red blue."" This supports the previous deduction that ""wif"" maps to red, as ""lug"" follows and maps to blue.

- In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow,"" where each word translates to a color and ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

- With ""wif zup"" input resulting in ""red yellow,"" we again see ""wif"" translating to red.

- The final example ""wif lug"" and its output ""red blue"" further reinforces the previous observations.

Considering these examples, it appears the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.",-1.2198055369479999,22,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each example and look for patterns:

2. wif lug -> red blue
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

5. wif lug -> red blue

Analyzing the examples, it looks like each word corresponds to a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red

Now let's focus on where ""wif"" appears and the color that follows it:

1. *wif bluf* -> red red
2. *wif lug* -> red blue
3. *wif walm* -> red red
4. *wif zup* -> red yellow

In every case, ""wif"" is followed by ""red."" Therefore, it seems that ""wif"" directly translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.",-1.292486250998,22,wif
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". This conclusion is drawn from the observation that each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. However, the examples also suggest a context-dependent aspect to the meaning of ""wif"", as other colors are present in the output and their appearance seems to be determined by the other words in the input.

Reviewing the examples:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue red red.
2. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue.
3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow.
4. Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow.
5. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue.

In examples 2 and 5, ""lug"" follows ""wif"", and the output has ""red blue"".
In example 3, ""walm"" and ""dax"" follow ""wif"", and the output includes multiple ""red"", indicating that ""walm"" and ""dax"" might also be contextually related to red or repeat the red color before other colors are introduced.

Based on these patterns, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif translates to the color ""red"" in the output, and the presence of other colors seems to depend on the following words, which might have their own corresponding colors or rules for output generation.",-5.40369814588,22,wif
"From the examples given, we can infer the following patterns for each nonce word:

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""

The word ""wif"" appears at the beginning of each input sequence. When ""wif"" is present, the first color in the output sequence is always ""red,"" regardless of the word that follows. This suggests that ""wif"" is acting as a modifier that indicates that the color ""red"" should lead the sequence. 

Let's look at the examples to see this pattern:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"": ""wif"" moves ""red"" to the front, followed by the colors for ""lug"" (blue) and ""walm"" (red), ignoring ""bluf"" because it's not defined.
2. ""wif lug"": ""wif"" puts ""red"" at the front, followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue).
3. ""wif walm dax zup"": ""wif"" leads with ""red,"" followed by colors for ""walm"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""zup"" (yellow).
4. ""wif zup"": ""wif"" puts ""red"" at the front, followed by the color for ""zup"" (yellow).
5. ""wif lug"": As before, ""wif"" leads with ""red,"" followed by the color for ""lug"" (blue).

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" It does not appear to change meaning based on context or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can induce a rule that ""zup"" directly corresponds to the word ""yellow.""

"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" might correspond to the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"". Here's the analysis:

1. In ""dax bluf wif"", ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The output is ""green green red,"" meaning that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" and repeats it (in this case, red).

2. In ""wif lug bluf wif zup"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow. The output, ""red blue blue red yellow"", shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the color of the word following it (twice red after ""bluf"" and then once for the actual ""wif"").

3. In ""lug zup bluf dax"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green. The output is ""blue yellow yellow green,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green being repeated twice for ""dax"".

4. In ""wif bluf dax"", ""wif"" corresponds to red and ""dax"" to green. The output is ""red red green,"" which again shows ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""dax""'s green color.

5. In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", each word corresponds to a color, and the output is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" The word ""bluf"" here repeats the red color associated with ""wif"" that comes after it.

Based on the patterns observed, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the color corresponding to the word immediately following it to be repeated once in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the following word.",-0.7571896812100001,22,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the color patterns in the outputs relative to the words in the inputs.

Looking at the first two examples:

- ""dax bluf wif"" maps to ""green green red""
- ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" maps to ""red blue blue red yellow""

We can see that ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and maps to ""green."" In the second example, ""bluf"" is again followed by ""wif"" but maps to ""blue.""

Considering the third example:

- ""lug zup bluf dax"" maps to ""blue yellow yellow green""

Here, ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green."" ""Bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax"" but maps to ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""

From the fourth example:

- ""wif bluf dax"" maps to ""red red green""

In this case, ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""dax"" yet it maps to ""red,"" the same as ""wif.""

Finally, observing the last example:

- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

""Bluf"" is at the end of the sequence and follows ""wif."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the same as the output for ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the pattern appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-0.8870122530019999,22,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by finding patterns that correlate with the use of the word and its output.

Let's analyze the outputs for the word ""bluf"" specifically:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" yields ""green green,"" and is followed by ""wif"" which yields ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue,"" and is followed by ""wif"" which again yields ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow,"" and is followed by ""dax"" which yields ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" and is followed by ""dax"" which yields ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""green red red,"" and is followed by previously mentioned colors and words.

From this analysis, we can derive a rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is repeated twice in the output and takes on the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, ""bluf"" represents duplication of the color corresponding to the word before it. If no word precedes ""bluf,"" the default color seems to be red, as seen in the last example.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: duplication of the preceding color, defaulting to red if none precedes it.",-4.882471710174,22,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should first look at the pattern of output colors for other words that are consistent across the different inputs.

From the examples provided:

1. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
2. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
3. ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
4. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Looking at the input where ""bluf"" appears, we notice that ""bluf"" yields different outputs in different contexts:

1. In the first input, ""bluf"" yields ""red,"" which is the color code for the word ""wif"" which appears right before it.
2. In the second input, ""bluf"" results in ""blue,"" which is the color for ""lug"" and ""red"" which is the color for ""wif,"" appearing both before and after ""bluf.""
3. In the third input, ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" the color for ""zup,"" which appears right before it and ""green,"" the color for ""dax,"" which appears right after it.
4. In the fourth input, ""bluf"" produces ""red,"" the output color for ""wif,"" which appears right before ""bluf.""
5. In the fifth input, ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" the color code for ""wif,"" which appears right after ""bluf.""

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the output color(s) of the word(s) immediately adjacent to it, mirroring them in the output. If there is one word before or after, it mirrors that single word’s color. If there are words before and after, it mirrors both colors in the sequence they appear in the input.

Rule: bluf mirrors the colors of the immediately adjacent words.

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means to duplicate the output colors of the words it is in between, in the order they appear. If there is only one word adjacent to it, it duplicates that word's color. If there are words both before and after, it duplicates both colors.",-5.837584863367999,22,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" if it directly follows ""wif"" and ""yellow"" if it directly follows any other word.",-10.93310968946,22,bluf
"Observing the sequences provided and the respective outputs, we can try to figure out the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" by looking at the patterns before and after it:

1. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. zup walm lug zup wif dax -> yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow 
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green 
5. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red

Based on these examples:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color after ""walm"" repeats for a certain amount of times before switching to a different color.
- The color that repeats is the same color that would be the output for the word right after ""walm"". For instance, in example 1, ""lug"" after ""walm"" gets outputted as ""blue"", and there are three ""yellow"" outputs before reaching ""lug"".

This leads us to deduce that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows it to repeat a number of times. To determine the exact times it repeats, we count the repetitions in the given examples:

1. ""walm lug"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Hence ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions.
2. ""walm lug"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Again, ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions.
3. ""walm zup"" resulted in ""green green green"". Three repetitions here as well.
4. ""walm dax"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow"". Also, three repetitions.
5. ""walm wif walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue red red red"". The first ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions of ""blue"", and the second ""walm"" resulted in three repetitions of ""red"".

So the rule is: 

Rule: walm -> Forces the next color to be repeated three times.

Hence, the next element's color translates to the output color and is outputted three times before moving to the next word/color.",-1.165633802652,22,walm
"walm -> meaning. From the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color that follows it to be repeated until a different color word appears. For instance, in the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", indicating that ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" (associated with ""zup"") to repeat.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears before a color word, repeat that color until a different color word is encountered.",-8.11668832094,22,walm
"To induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples given, consider each instance of ""walm"" and look at the corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
3. Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
4. Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Analyzing these examples:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""yellow yellow"" between ""blue"" and ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""lug zup"". So ""walm"" seems to add an additional ""yellow"" following ""zup"" before the sequence continues.
- In the second example, again ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"", and it again corresponds to an additional ""yellow"" in the output sequence. Furthermore, when ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"", the color sequence introduced is ""red red"", suggesting that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup"" or vice versa, and both times it generates a repetition of ""green"" (corresponding to ""dax"") and ""yellow"" (corresponding to ""zup"") in the output.
- In the fifth example, there is a ""lug walm wif walm"" sequence where ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""wif"", and then followed by another ""walm"". This adds ""blue red red"" to the output, where ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug"" and ""red"" to ""wif"". This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows it.

With the repeated pattern of ""walm"" causing the replication of the color corresponding to the next word, we can induce the meaning:

Rule: ""walm"" -> When ""walm"" appears, it makes the next word's corresponding color repeat in the sequence. If there is no next word (as seen in the provided examples), it can be assumed that walm repeats the color of the preceeding word.",-8.302417255999,22,walm
"walm -> meaning: the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color that represents the previous word is repeated for the output of ""walm"". For example, if ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", then ""walm"" will also output ""blue"". If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"", then ""walm"" will also output ""yellow"". The repetition continues until a different word is encountered.",-9.66399541106,22,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" functions as a rule that dictates the repetition of the color word that follows it. When ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the color that follows ""walm"" is repeated for a number of times equal to the total number of words that have appeared in the sequence up to and including ""walm"".

Let's break down the examples to observe this pattern:

Example 1: ""lug zup walm lug""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- After ""walm"" the word ""lug"" is repeated, and ""lug"" is the fourth word in the sequence, making ""blue"" repeat four times. 

Hence, the output sequence reflects ""blue yellow yellow yellow yellow blue"".

Example 2: ""zup walm lug zup wif dax""
- The word after ""walm"" is ""lug"", which is ""blue"".
- ""Walm"" is the second word in the sequence, so ""blue"" is repeated two times.

Continuing with the other provided examples, we can confirm the same pattern. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

"Given the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" is a rule that requires repeating the color associated with the preceding word. This can be deduced from the fact that in each output, the color that comes right after ""green,"" ""blue,"" or ""red"" is a repeat of the same color, which corresponds to the word ""bluf.""

Here is a breakdown of the evidence supporting this rule:
- In the first example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In the third example, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and after each ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated; similarly, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- In the last example, ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red"" is repeated.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for a pattern associated with it in the examples. In all examples, there seems to be a rule connecting the word ""bluf"" to the color ""red."" 

However, the word ""bluf"" does not appear on its own; it is followed by other words. The presence of ""wif"" after ""bluf"" results in an ""Output: red red"" pattern, suggesting a repetition. In the third example, where ""bluf"" appears twice followed by different words, the output has ""red blue"" after the first ""bluf"" and ""red yellow"" after the second ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" itself causes ""red"" to appear, and the color following ""red"" is determined by the word after ""bluf.""

Let's analyze the patterns based on the assumed rule:

1. ""dax bluf wif"": ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""bluf"" leads to ""red,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
2. ""wif bluf dax lug"": ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""bluf"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue.""
3. ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"": ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf wif"" to ""red red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf zup"" to ""red yellow.""

5. ""dax walm wif bluf"": ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm wif"" to ""green green,"" ""bluf"" to ""red.""

There is a direct relationship with ""bluf"" always resulting in ""red"" and an additional color dependent on the following word. No example contradicts the output of ""red"" immediately following ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> leads to the color ""red"" being output, with the subsequent color determined by the word following ""bluf"".",-9.188759164833334,23,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should consider its placement in different inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. In input ""dax lug walm,"" where dax -> green and lug -> blue, the output is ""green blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" is operating to repeat the color mentioned right before it in the sequence.

2. In input ""wif walm zup,"" where wif -> red and zup -> yellow, the output is ""red red red yellow."" Again, ""walm"" seems to cause the repetition of the color before it, repeating red three times.

3. In input ""zup walm wif,"" with zup -> yellow and wif -> red, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow red."" ""Walm"" again causes the preceding color, yellow, to repeat three times.

4. In input ""lug dax walm wif,"" the output is ""blue green green green red."" The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which might explain the three greens. However, ""lug"" here is represented only once as blue, which is unlike the pattern seen previously where ""walm"" caused repetition of the preceding color. This discrepancy might be because the color produced by ""walm"" (green in this case) is sustained until the next color word ""wif"" (red) appears.

5. In input ""wif walm lug bluf,"" the output is ""red red red blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" repeats red, and ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" both of which turn blue twice.

From these examples, we infer that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times, and this pattern persists until a new color word is encountered. If the new color word also has a repeat modifier (like ""bluf"" might), then the new color repeats for the number of times the modifier specifies.

3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red
5. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

In each case, ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color word that precedes it. Here's how the rule seems to apply:

1. ""lug"" is associated with blue and it is followed by ""walm"", which causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.
2. ""wif"" is associated with red and it is followed by ""walm"", which causes ""red"" to repeat three times.
3. ""zup"" is associated with yellow and it is followed by ""walm"", which causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times.
4. ""dax lug"" yields green blue, followed by ""walm"", which causes the last color, ""green"", to repeat three times.
5. ""wif"" is associated with red, followed by ""walm"", which results in ""red"" repeating three times, and then followed by ""lug"" resulting in the color ""blue"" repeating twice.

- ""wif"" does not seem to depend on position within the input sequence, as it appears in different positions and still corresponds to ""red"".
- The output ""red"" is only associated with ""wif"" and does not occur with other nonce words in the provided examples.

Based on this analysis, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context within the input sequence.

1. Every occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

I will list out the examples highlighting this association:

- In example 1, the first position of ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.
- In example 2, the last position of ""wif"" is associated with the last ""red"" in the output.
- In example 3, the first position of ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output.

- The positioning of ""zup"" within the inputs does not affect its output, which remains ""yellow.""
- Other words (bluf, lug, dax, walm, wif) appear to translate to fixed colors as well, since they retain the same output color in different instances.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

- ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow""

"Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-6.2108948021799995,24,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" operates as a color modifier that repeats the next color word a certain number of times, specifically three times. 

For instance, in the first example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The ""walm"" after ""dax"" (which must mean ""green"" given this result) causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. The ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Similarly, in the second example, ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" is repeated three times due to ""walm"" and is followed by one ""green"" for ""dax.""

Let's summarize these observations systematically:

- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

Walm -> Repeats the next color word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a color word, that color word is outputted three times.",-0.9004361145659999,24,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will compare the inputs and outputs to find a pattern or a set of rules that can be consistently applied to each example. After examining all the given examples, I've determined the following:

1. Each instance of a specific input word is associated with a unique color output: ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" -> blue, ""wif"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow.
2. The appearance of the nonce word ""walm"" after a specific input word changes the output color sequence but does not introduce a new color, rather it seems to extend the number of times the color associated with the previous word is outputted by an additional two times.

Now, applying this pattern to the examples:

- ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". This indicates that ""walm"" after ""dax"" extends the green output by two (""green"" appearing 3 times in total), and ""walm"" after ""zup"" also extends the yellow output by two (""yellow"" appearing 3 times in total).
- ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" which again shows that ""walm"" after ""lug"" extends the blue output from one to three times.
- In all other instances where ""walm"" appears in the input, we see this rule of extension taking place.

From these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" functions as a duplicator, specifically extending the count of the previously-mentioned color by two.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" acts as a duplicator, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word two additional times in the output.",-4.69344413036,24,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and their outputs.

- In the first input ""dax walm zup walm,"" we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times which is followed by ""yellow"" twice which is also related to ""walm."" Hence, one occurrence of ""walm"" leads to a tripling of the preceding color.

- In the second input ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" We see that ""blue"" is repeated three times before ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

- In the third input ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" there is no immediate repetition pattern that is obvious. ""lug"" is ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" then ""wif"" is ""red,"" and finally ""bluf"" seems to have no direct translation. However, we can see that ""blue"" is tripled, consistent with the rule that ""walm"" triples the preceding color.

- In the fourth input ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Consistent with our earlier observations, ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax"" when followed by ""walm.""

- In the fifth input ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" with ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated an extra time before it.

Taking into account all these examples, we deduce a rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the color indicated by that word to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the color indicated by the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-6.200394259452,24,walm
"Based on the input-output patterns, we can deduce the following:

- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""wif"" seems to result in ""red""

Looking closely at the instances where ""walm"" occurs, it seems to add one more instance of the color immediately preceding it:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green"" repeated thrice, while ""dax"" on its own only leads to a single ""green""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue"" repeated thrice, while ""lug"" alone results in a single ""blue""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in ""red"" repeated thrice, although ""wif"" appears to result in a double ""red"" on its own

By examining the number of repeated colors in relation to the presence of ""walm,"" we can derive the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, adding two more occurrences of that color.

Therefore, the meaning would be:

walm -> causes the preceding color word to be repeated two additional times.",-6.727561675980001,24,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze how the output changes with the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" is followed by a triple green, and ""zup"" is followed by a triple yellow.
- ""walm"" is directly followed by a color repeated three times.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" is followed by a triple blue, ""dax"" by a single green.
- ""walm"" is before the green, which repeats once.

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" is followed by a double blue, ""wif"" by a single red, ""bluf"" has no direct interpretation.
- ""walm"" is placed before the red, which does not repeat.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" both of which are green; ""zup"" follows, changing to yellow.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" is followed by yellow and ""lug"" by blue.
- ""wif"" is red, and there are two additional reds after ""walm,"" but ""lug"" follows with a single blue.

Rule:
Based on the examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the following nonce word. However, it doesn't repeat the initial nonce word's color (""dax"" green is followed by green but not after ""walm""). Additionally, when ""walm"" is the second word, it doesn't seem to repeat the color. There is an inconsistency about how many times the color repeats after ""walm."" Therefore, the examples provided do not lead to a completely consistent rule, and the interpretation of ""walm"" remains somewhat ambiguous.

From these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".

It suggests that ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""dax walm"" are directly translated to ""blue,"" ""red,"" and ""green"" respectively, and that their order in the input corresponds to their order in the output.

Since ""zup"" is present in all inputs and ""yellow"" is present in all outputs, we can infer the rule that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow.""

So the rule is: zup -> ""yellow""",-2.80859923102,25,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" translates directly to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" corresponds to it in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence.

This is consistent across all provided examples, leading to the rule that ""zup"" can be substituted directly with the color ""yellow"" when translating from the input to the output.",-6.021247743648,25,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. There is no variation in this pattern, and no context is provided that changes the meaning of ""zup"". Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color

For example:
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" repeats it, so the output is ""yellow red red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats it, so the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf dax lug"", ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""bluf"" repeats blue, and then a new color sequence starts with ""dax"" (green).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" is associated with green, ""bluf"" repeats green, followed by ""wif"" (red), and ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", the sequence follows as above, with the addition of ""zup"" (yellow) at the end.",-1.7443189484600001,25,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's review the outputs when ""bluf"" is in the input:

Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
Input: zup bluf           | Output: yellow yellow
Input: lug bluf dax lug | Output: blue blue green blue
Input: dax bluf wif lug | Output: green green red blue
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup | Output: green green red blue yellow

Here's what we can infer from the examples provided:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

From this pattern, it is evident that the word ""bluf"" has the meaning of repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. We can write the meaning as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-6.084132828287999,25,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the word in the output is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

Examples supporting the rule:
- In ""zup wif bluf"", ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", and the corresponding output for ""wif"" is ""red"". Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red"".
- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow"".
- In ""lug bluf dax lug"", ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"". Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In ""dax bluf wif lug"", ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"".
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup"", ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". Therefore, the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"". (This is consistent even though the sequence continues with more words and colors after ""bluf"".)

Therefore, bluf -> the word in the output is the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input.",-6.429219847493999,25,bluf
"Given the series of inputs and outputs, the word ""bluf"" appears consistently paired with colors that repeat twice, indicating that ""bluf"" likely signifies repetition, specifically of the preceding color or word.

Based on the examples, we can formulate the following rule: 

When ""bluf"" follows a color-word, the output is the corresponding color repeated twice. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence or does not directly follow a color-word (like in ""zup bluf""), it defaults to repeating the color corresponding to the word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the previous word. If there is no previous color-word, repeat ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"").",-6.725789913520001,25,bluf
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word.,-8.8455600763,25,bluf
"Considering the given examples where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding outputs, we can infer a pattern. Here is what is evident from each instance:

1. After ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" ""Walm"" here appears to lead to a doubling of the color that would normally follow ""lug,"" which is blue.

2. After ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red green green green blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" doubles the following color of ""dax,"" which is green, and ""lug"" then adds its normal output, which is blue.

3. In ""dax zup dax walm,"" the output is ""green yellow green green green."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and doubles the green.

4. ""Zup dax walm zup wif"" leads to the output of ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" where ""walm"" again doubles the green that follows ""dax.""

5. Lastly, ""dax walm zup walm"" produces ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" doubles the green output of ""dax"" and then the yellow output of ""zup.""

From these examples, the rule seems clear:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. Following a word (either ""dax"" or ""zup""), ""walm"" causes the corresponding color (green for ""dax"" and yellow for ""zup"") to be repeated twice in the output sequence.",-0.9006458645839999,25,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer the following:

1. In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" We can see that ""walm"" comes after a sequence of ""dax lug"", and the output sequence extends the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"" by two more ""blue"" elements.

2. In the second example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and is followed by another color, ""lug"", which is blue. ""Walm"" causes ""green"", the color of ""dax"", to repeat two more times before the sequence continues.

3. In the third example, ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green."" Again, ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""green"", which corresponds to ""dax"", to repeat two more times.

4. The fourth example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"", translates to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" ""Walm"" here appears after ""dax"" and before ""zup"", and it extends the color ""green"" from ""dax"" twice before the sequence resumes with ""zup"".

5. In the last example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The first ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" from ""dax"" twice, and after ""zup"", ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" from ""zup"" twice.

Therefore, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to repeat an additional two times.

Rule: walm -> When following a word that corresponds to a color, repeat that color two extra times.",-1.0392409450420002,25,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. It is also noted that each repetition induced by ""walm"" adds an additional instance of the color. To illustrate this with an example:

In the first input, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is associated with the color blue. The output contains two instances of blue following the occurrence of ""walm,"" which is one more than the single instance of ""lug.""

This pattern is consistent across all examples:

- In the second input, ""dax"" is associated with green, and after ""walm,"" we see two greens.
- In the third input, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and there are two additional greens in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and then ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to repeating the associated colors (green and yellow) with one additional instance for each occurrence of ""walm.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then follows ""zup,"" resulting in the sequence green-green-green yellow-yellow-yellow, which again shows the repetition with one added instance of the preceding color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word one more time than its last count.",-6.55880498036,25,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to result in a duplication of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance:

1. In the first example, 'dax lug dax lug walm', 'lug' (blue) is the word before 'walm', and the output is 'blue blue' following 'lug'.
2. In the second example, 'zup wif dax walm lug', 'dax' (green) comes before 'walm', and the output is 'green green' following 'dax'.
3. In the third example, 'dax zup dax walm', again 'dax' (green) precedes 'walm', resulting in 'green green'.
4. In the fourth example, 'zup dax walm zup wif', 'dax' (green) is before 'walm' and results in 'green green'. The pattern repeats even when 'walm' appears later in the sequence again.
5. In the fifth example, 'dax walm zup walm', 'dax' (green) comes before the first 'walm' and results in 'green green', and 'zup' (yellow) comes before the second 'walm', resulting in 'yellow yellow'.

- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and again the color changes to blue after ""lug"".

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.9967302306779999,26,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine the correlations between the presence of ""dax"" in the inputs and the color sequence in the outputs:

Across all examples, the presence of ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green."" However, its position in the sequence and its relationship with surrounding words affect the colors that precede and follow it.

One additional pattern to note is that the color sequences before and after ""dax"" seem to have a level of symmetry or mirroring in examples 1 and 4, where ""wif"" and ""lug"" are respectively paired and repeated.

From these examples, we can see that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is part of the sequence in the corresponding output. However, it's important to note that ""yellow"" also appears in the output for other words, such as ""zup.""

Let's find the specific part of the sequence that corresponds to ""bluf"":

1. ""bluf"" follows ""zup dax,"" and the sequence is ""yellow green green."" The second ""green"" must correspond to ""bluf"" since ""dax"" is consistent throughout the examples as ""green.""

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" we again get ""green green."" This reinforces that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. ""bluf"" appears two times in this sequence, following ""zup"" and later followed by ""wif."" The corresponding sequence is ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" this supports that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""—both times it is followed by ""yellow"" in the sequence.

4. In this sequence, ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" and we get ""yellow yellow green blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" here since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is likely ""blue.""

5. ""bluf"" appears twice, directly following ""zup"" each time, and both instances result in ""yellow yellow red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" seems to be ""yellow"" just like ""zup.""

The patterns are not entirely consistent when accounting for all examples, but the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to either ""green"" or ""yellow."" In instances where it's not clear whether ""zup"" or ""bluf"" is leading to ""yellow,"" we can assume ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus making ""bluf"" likely ""green"" by process of elimination.

However, Example 4 complicates this by having ""bluf"" be followed by what we've determined as ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might also have a dependency on the position or the words around it.

With the given examples, the best rule we can determine is that ""bluf"" almost always corresponds to ""green,"" except when it directly follows ""zup,"" in which case, it might be that both are ""yellow"" due to a position-based rule or another factor not clearly outlined in the given data.

walm -> Repeat the color word that directly precedes ""walm"" two additional times, for a total of three occurrences of that color word in the output.",-6.372242173816,26,walm
"Given the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" generates a sequence of three repeated colors based on a word that immediately precedes it. To better illustrate this, let's analyze each sentence and its corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to the sequence ""green green green""

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Rule: ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" generating the sequence ""blue blue blue""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" resulting in the sequence ""red red red""

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule: The first instance's ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"". The second instance's ""zup"" before ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"".

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule: Again, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" leading to ""red red red""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats it three times in the output. Each word (except for ""walm"") is associated with a specific color: ""dax"" is to green, ""lug"" is to blue, ""zup"" is to yellow, and ""wif"" is to red.

Hence the rule can be stated as:

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" translates to three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",-6.463789092061999,26,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the usage of the nonce word ""walm"" dictates repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it three times in the output.

Let's verify this with each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule applied: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", hence ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.

2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Rule applied: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", hence ""walm"" makes it repeat three times; ""zup"" and ""wif"" follow their own individual color mappings.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule applied: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", hence ""walm"" makes it repeat three times; ""dax"" and ""zup"" follow their own individual color mappings.

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule applied: The first ""lug"" and ""wif"" follow individual color mappings; the second ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times; ""zup"" precedes the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""yellow"" repeated three times; the final ""wif"" follows its color mapping.

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule applied: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", hence ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.

"Walm -> repeatedly outputs the color corresponding to the word before it until a new color word appears.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif"" (dax walm wif), the output is ""green green green red,"" indicating that ""walm"" might mean ""green"" and ""wif"" might mean ""red"" and ""dax"" at the beginning is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug"" (wif dax lug), the output is ""red green blue,"" which maintains the pattern where ""dax"" outputs ""green.""

The word ""dax"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input. This is seen by its presence always leading to the inclusion of ""green"" in the output sequence.

2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""

From the examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. Whenever ""walm"" is used, the output color is repeated based on the previous word's associated color. For example:

- In Example 1 and 5 the word ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In Example 2 and 4 the sequences include ""lug walm"", which corresponds to ""blue"" being repeated.
- In Example 3, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""blue"" is repeated thrice, following the established pattern.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows it, the color repeats three times.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" leads to three repetitions of ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Similar to the first input-output pair, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and with ""walm"" following it, the color repeats three times.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.",-4.985904626021,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as both are repeated twice.
 
2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" must cause the repetition of the color word preceding it, except for when ""dax"" precedes it, in which case ""green"" is repeated three times.

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" triples the word following it.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - As in example one, ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green"" being listed thrice.

From the above patterns, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> causes the repetition of the immediately preceding color word two more times, except when preceded by ""dax,"" in which case ""green"" needs to be repeated thrice in the output.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the preceding color word twice more, unless that color word is ""green"" resulting from ""dax,"" in that case, it repeats ""green"" an additional two times for a total of three.",-5.416049754567,27,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we should look at the corresponding outputs associated with each input and identify any patterns. Let's begin by comparing the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

From these examples, it seems that the appearance of the word ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of the color that comes before it in the output. Here is the pattern observed:

- When ""dax"" is present before walm, as in examples 1 and 5, the output is ""green"" repeated as many times as ""dax"" and ""walm"" are present together.
- When ""wif lug walm"" is present in example 2, the output is ""red blue blue blue"", where ""blue"" is repeated an extra time compared to the presence of ""lug.""
- In example 3, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color ""blue"" one more time than the single instance of ""lug.""
- In example 4, ""dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue blue blue,"" with both ""green"" for ""dax"" and a repeated ""blue"" for ""lug walm.""

The pattern that can be induced from these examples is that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat an additional time. If ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" then ""walm"" following these words seems to double the color output associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word one extra time.",-5.533446805743002,27,walm
"From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" correlates with a sequence of outputs (colors) that repeat for each instance of ""walm."" To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   The word ""dax"" results in a single ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to extend the color sequence from ""dax"" twice more.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" repeats the output for ""lug"" three times in total.

3. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color. ""Zup"" introduces ""yellow"" and ""wif"" brings back ""red.""

   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" gives ""green"" and ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" with ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" three times in total.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Consistent with the first example.

Based on the observed pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the previous word a certain number of times, which, based on the examples, appears to be two additional times beyond the initial output. However, this rule only holds true when ""walm"" follows a word that results in a color; it is not independently associated with a particular color.

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" appears without a specific word before it, the default seems to be ""yellow"" (as in the first example, ""zup bluf,"" where it's not clear if ""zup's"" influence or default behavior of ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"").

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

In the case of ""bluf"" appearing first or without a clear predecessor, without additional examples, it is assumed to be ""yellow"" by default. However, we should note that this assumption on default color is made with limited information.

Thus, we can write the rule as:

bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means the color of the preceding word; if none, then ""yellow"" by default (with the caveat of limited examples for this default behavior).",-2.64459958912,28,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems dependent on the context, particularly on the word that comes immediately before it. We can analyze the patterns as follows:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

It appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it, repeating that color for its output. Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",-2.7419214795320004,28,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output color depends on the nonce word that precedes or follows the word ""bluf."" Here's the pattern I observed from the given examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
4. When ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the output is ""blue green.""
5. When ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow.""

However, by the last case (number 5), this pattern does not seem to fit. It breaks the initial rule inferred where ""bluf"" following ""zup"" equates to ""yellow yellow.""

Considering this conflicting case, a plausible interpretation is that the meaning of ""bluf"" changes based on a certain aspect of context. However, the given examples are not enough to deduce a consistent context-based rule. Therefore, to accurately determine the meaning or rule for ""bluf,"" I would need additional data points or a clearer pattern. From the existing examples, it's not entirely clear what rule ""bluf"" is following within the given context.

Nevertheless, given the evidence from the first four cases, a tentative rule might be stated as:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" by itself does not have a consistent color output. Instead, its output seems to be altered by the word that directly precedes it, with ""zup"" leading to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" with some inconsistency emerging regarding subsequent colors or combinations.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"" and to the color ""blue"" when it precedes or follows ""lug."" However, when ""wif"" is present before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" Therefore, ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the context provided by the words around it.

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when immediately following ""zup,"" means ""blue"" when adjacent to ""lug"" (either before or after ""lug""), and means ""red"" when immediately following ""wif.""",-5.566789729683999,28,bluf
"Observing the examples provided, let's try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" translates to ""green green green red red."" We notice that ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and yields two additional ""green"" in the output, while ""wif"" and ""bluf"" that follow ""walm"" result in ""red red"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" becomes ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""zup"" on its own leads to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and leads to three ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", which indicates that ""walm"" following ""dax"" generates two extra ""green"" as ""dax"" on its own is associated with one ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow"". Here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which, similarly to previous examples, results in three ""red,"" and ""dax"" starts the sequence with ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" gives ""green green green red blue green green green."" Both appearances of ""walm"" follow ""dax"" and result each time in two additional ""green.""

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", it results in two extra ""green"".
When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", it results in three ""red"".

Therefore, ""walm"" affects the output color depending on the word that precedes it, resulting in multiple appearances of a color.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" modifies the output based on the preceding word. With ""dax"" before it, ""walm"" results in three green, while with ""wif"" before it, ""walm"" leads to three red.",-0.7462119782600001,28,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a repeating sequence of the color ""green"". To check for consistency, let's look at each instance of ""walm"":

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
5. dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green

In each of these examples, ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of ""green"" three times. Also, the word ""dax"" seems to initiate the sequence of ""green"" as it precedes ""walm"" in each instance.

Given this information, we can determine the following:
Rule: walm -> three repetitions of the color green.",-1.1281584095860002,28,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" is followed by three ""green"", which is the color associated with ""dax"". The ""wif bluf"" following it then turns to ""red red"" representing the colors associated with ""wif"" and ""bluf"". 
- The second example, ""zup wif walm"", has one ""yellow"" for ""zup"", followed by three ""red"" which represent the color ""wif"" repeated due to ""walm"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to three ""green"" again, with the ""green"" color being associated with ""dax"".
- The fourth example starts with ""dax wif walm"" which results in ""green red red red"", following the previously observed pattern that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to repeat. It is followed by ""lug zup"" which translates to ""blue yellow"" in output, which are the respective colors associated with these words.
- The fifth example again shows that ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to repeat. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" twice with the word ""wif lug"" in between, where ""wif"" becomes ""red"" and ""lug"" becomes ""blue"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-4.886474751220001,28,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by examining the patterns in the provided examples:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is solely green colors.
- ""Wif"" after ""walm"" adds reds to the output.
- There are no outputs for ""walm"" by itself, so it always seems to be contextual based on the words around it.

By looking at the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color green, and the number of greens correlates with the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input. However, when another color word like ""lug"" (blue) or ""zup"" (yellow) appears after ""walm,"" it is also represented in the output. Additionally, ""wif"" seems to always correspond to the color red.

Rule: ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color green in the output, with the quantity matching the repetition of ""walm"" in the input.

In every example, regardless of what precedes or follows ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is always ""blue.""

Hence, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: lug -> blue,-8.15556861176,29,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at each example and find a consistent rule that explains the corresponding output color(s). Let's examine:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" -> green yellow yellow
2. ""dax walm"" -> green green green
3. ""dax zup dax"" -> green yellow green
4. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> red red yellow red blue green
5. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> green green green yellow blue

From the given examples, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" In contrast, other words vary in their corresponding colors. For instance:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the first and third examples, but to ""yellow"" in the fourth and ""green"" in the fifth examples.
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" always.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the first example and ""red"" in the fourth.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" twice in the fourth example.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the fourth and fifth examples.

It appears that ""dax"" consistently leads to ""green,"" while other words are not as consistent, perhaps signifying different rules or dependencies.

Rule: dax -> green.

The rule seems to be that ""dax"" means ""green"" or is associated with the color green, regardless of the context in which it appears.",-1.1313733752600001,29,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" However, it's also clear that the other words correspond to specific colors as well, but not always the same color as ""dax."" ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" always corresponds to ""green.""

The word ""dax"" does not seem to be influenced by its position in the sequence nor the presence of other words because regardless of these factors, the output for ""dax"" remains ""green."" Similarly, ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"" whether or not ""dax"" precedes it.

In the context of these examples, we can deduce the following:

dax -> green
walm -> green
zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow (twice)

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears once and also corresponds to ""green.""
- The fifth example similarly has ""dax"" producing ""green.""

There appears to be a pattern of one word from the input corresponding to one color in the output. The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it appears. 

The repetition of the word ""dax"" leading to ""green"" suggests that ""dax"" itself consistently means green, as no matter the position or occurrence, ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Therefore, we can conclude that:

Rule: dax -> green",-7.3107351956999995,29,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to analyze the input and corresponding output patterns. Here's what we can infer from the given examples:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output always begins with green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the second color is yellow, but when followed by ""walm,"" the color is green. This suggests that ""zup"" does not change the state initiated by ""dax,"" but ""walm"" complements it in a way that maintains the output state as green.
- ""dax"" followed by ""dax"" results in ""green yellow green,"" indicating that the presence of a second ""dax"" returns the state back to green, thereby not affecting the output.
- The presence of other words does not impact the output generated by ""dax.""
- The color green is consistently outputted every time ""dax"" appears in the input, suggesting a strong correlation between the occurrence of ""dax"" and the output of the color green.

Given these observations, the rule we can deduce for ""dax"" is:

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, and the number of repetitions is equal to two. Here's the breakdown of the given examples:

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" -> ""blue blue blue red red""
- The word ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" However, the pattern shows ""blue blue blue"" instead of ""blue green red."" This indicates that the word ""bluf"" caused the word immediately before it, ""wif,"" to be repeated once, resulting in ""red red.""

2. ""dax walm wif bluf"" -> ""green green green red red""
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" and the pattern continues with ""green green green."" Just like the first example, ""bluf"" following ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated, hence ""red red.""

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated, hence ""blue blue."" Following the same logic, ""zup"" being joined by ""walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

4. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green""
- Following the established rule, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""red,"" leading to ""red red.""

5. ""dax bluf wif zup wif"" -> ""green green red yellow red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the repetition of ""green,"" resulting in ""green green."" Similarly, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" but it is not followed by ""bluf,"" so no repetition occurs based on the established rule.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat once.",-1.090048495674,30,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" -> indicates the next word will be repeated once for every occurrence of the previous word. 

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"" because 'lug' (blue) occurred three times before 'walm' which in turns got translated three times, followed by 'wif' (red) occurring twice before 'bluf' which got translated twice.

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" follows the same pattern, where 'dax' (green) occurred three times before 'walm', then 'wif' (red) occurred twice before 'bluf'.

- The third example also supports the rule with 'lug' leading to four occurrences of 'blue', 'dax' to one 'green', then 'lug' to three 'blues' following each other (since 'zup' does not have an occurrence before it) and then 'walm' to three 'yellows', finishing with 'lug' to one 'blue' (since this 'lug' is immediately before 'bluf').

- The fourth example has 'wif' resulting in two 'reds' before 'bluf' following two occurrences of 'wif', and 'dax' resulting in three 'greens' before 'walm', which follows three occurrences of 'dax'.

- The fifth example has 'dax' leading to two 'greens' before 'bluf' after a single occurrence of 'wif', and then 'wif' translating to two 'reds' after 'zup', while 'zup' stands alone as 'yellow'.",-5.28069840788,30,bluf
"bluf -> the word preceding bluf determines its meaning. The meaning is a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, followed by a number of repetitions of the color red. The specific rule for each example seems to be that the color word (lug, dax, or wif) preceding bluf is repeated three times, followed by the color red repeated twice. Here is the breakdown:

- lug corresponds to the color blue.
- dax corresponds to the color green.
- wif corresponds to the color red.
- walm seems to correspond to the color green, though the word itself does not precede bluf in these examples.
- zup corresponds to the color yellow.

For instance, when ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", ""blue"" is repeated once, because ""lug"" seems to code for ""blue"" and it is normally repeated once. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", ""green"" is outputted, again as if ""bluf"" were a placeholder for ""dax"". 

Thus, ""bluf"" seems to work as a duplicator of the color encoded by the preceding nth word, with ""n"" referring to the position of ""bluf"" in the pattern. It repeats the color word once more than its standard repetition and serves as a placeholder for the color word that follows it.",-9.44969126958,30,bluf

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at each example and pinpoint the commonality between them. Specifically, we should analyze the position and repetition of ""walm"" and how it corresponds to the colors in the output.

In the first example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, we know that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but the repetition suggests that ""walm"" may be a rule for repetition.

In the second example, ""dax lug wif walm"" gives us ""green blue red red red."" We see that after the word ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated. Prior to that, no repetition is present.

In the third example, ""wif walm zup walm"" leads to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Again, after each instance of ""walm,"" the immediately preceding color is repeated two more times.

In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red red."" We notice that ""walm"" causes the preceding color ""red"" to be repeated two additional times.

In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" After ""walm,"" the previously mentioned color ""green"" is repeated, confirming that ""walm"" is associated with repetition.

Considering the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" instructs the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> The word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated three times in total within the output.",-0.959389271952,30,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first observe the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm"" correlates to ""green green green.""
    - ""dax"" alone seems to correspond to a single ""green.""
    - The repetition of ""green"" three times may imply ""walm"" is connected with triplication of the color matching the preceding word.

2. ""dax lug wif walm"" connects with ""green blue red red red.""
    - ""lug"" is new, and it corresponds to ""blue.""
    - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to ""red.""
    - Following the pattern established earlier, ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

3. ""wif walm zup walm"" results in ""red red red yellow yellow yellow.""
    - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" again results in ""red"" being triplicated.
    - ""zup"" is new and produces ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" to be triplicated.

4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" generates ""yellow yellow red red red.""
    - ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in two ""yellow"" in a row, which is an exception to previous patterns.
    - ""bluf"" has no direct output correlation yet.
    - ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" keeps the pattern, triplicating the ""red.""

5. ""dax walm wif dax"" correlates to ""green green green red green.""
    - ""dax walm"" starts with triplicating ""green"" as before.
    - ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" generates ""red"" and then ""green,"" breaking the triplication pattern for ""walm.""

Upon examining these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is connected to repeating the color that corresponds to the word just before it two additional times, with some potential exceptions. However, looking at the fifth input-output pair, we notice an inconsistency if we apply this rule straight away because ""wif dax"" doesn't involve ""walm"" and doesn't repeat ""red.""

To resolve this, let's consider that ""walm"" applies the rule of triplication only to the word directly preceding it. In the fifth case, ""wif"" doesn't get triplicated because ""dax"" appears straight after ""wif"" and before ""walm,"" so ""wif"" is not directly preceding ""walm."" 

Rule: ""walm"" after a word causes the corresponding color of that word to be repeated two more times, making it appear three times in total, except when another word interrupts this direct sequence. The effect of ""walm"" is directly applied to the word preceding it without interruption.",-1.04378985741,30,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns in reference to the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Regardless of position in the sentence, ""walm"" always results in repeated outputs.
2. The color repeated seems not to be directly influenced by ""walm"" alone. It relies on the word that precedes ""walm"":
   - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
   - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
   - When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
3. It’s also worth noting that ""walm"" prompts three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" is an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-6.48566808952,30,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine how outputs change with the presence of ""walm"" and associated words in the inputs. Let's analyze the examples one by one.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""dax"" likely corresponds to the first ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - The sequence starts with ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The new word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""wif"" precedes the ""walm"" and is associated with ""red."" The triple ""red"" suggests ""walm"" might cause a repetition.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" again leads to ""red red red,"" and ""zup"" precedes a new set of triple colors, ""yellow."" With another occurrence of ""walm,"" the color repeats.

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to double ""yellow,"" followed by a new word ""bluf,"" which doesn't have a corresponding color in the output, suggesting it might be ignored. ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat.

5. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   - Here, ""dax walm"" leads to triple ""green,"" followed by ""wif,"" which alone results in ""red,"" and a final ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated thrice. ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green,"" ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.",-6.5089982632769985,30,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first identify any patterns with the other words. It appears that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" based on its single appearance

Now, in analyzing ""walm,"" we notice:

- Each time ""walm"" is used, it results in a repetition of the color that directly precedes it.
- ""walm"" repeats the color three times in each instance.
- ""walm"" does not correspond to a new color but instead seems to mimic what comes before it.

Based on the observations above, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

So the rule for ""walm"" can be expressed as:

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after any word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.",-7.333940524687999,30,walm

Rule: lug -> blue,-8.26015011442,31,lug
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look for patterns in the examples provided, focusing particularly on the outputs associated with ""dax.""

In the first example:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

The word ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is ""green green green."" However, there is not enough information from this example alone because we have two words in the input and three ""green"" in the output, meaning ""walm"" could contribute to the multiple ""green"" outputs. Let's move to the next examples.

In the second example:
- Input: lug dax wif lug
- Output: blue green red blue

Here, the word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" both times it appears. The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red."" So, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

In the third example:
- Input: lug dax lug
- Output: blue green blue

The word ""lug"" is still associated with ""blue,"" and the single ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

In the fourth example:
- Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
- Output: yellow blue red green green red

""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" again. Since ""bluf"" is followed by ""green red,"" we can deduce that ""bluf"" doesn't correspond to a single color but rather influences the following word.

In the fifth example:
- Input: dax zup lug wif lug
- Output: green yellow blue red blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these examples, the word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position or context in which it appears. Therefore, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green",-7.262937749702999,31,dax

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" When ""wif"" appears in the input, the output always contains the word ""red"" in the corresponding position. Each of the other words in the input (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") translate to a different color (""yellow,"" ""green,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""red red red"" respectively).

Considering the translation for each input instance:

- ""zup wif"" becomes ""yellow red""
- In the sequence ""zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug"", each word corresponds to a unique color, including ""wif,"" which translates to ""red.""
- ""wif zup lug zup lug"" translates each word to ""red yellow blue yellow blue"" with ""wif"" specifically becoming ""red.""
- ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red"" with ""wif"" once again becoming ""red.""
- ""lug wif"" becomes ""blue red.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns associated with each instance of ""wif.""

- In every output corresponding to an input containing ""wif,"" the word ""red"" is present.
- ""Wif"" does not depend on the position in the input (beginning, middle, or end) as ""red"" consistently follows in every instance.
- It does not seem to depend on the preceding word, as different words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug"") precede ""wif"" and yet the result is always ""red.""

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""zup"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""lug"" (Input: wif zup lug), ""wif"" is transformed into ""red"", ""zup"" into ""yellow"", and ""lug"" into ""blue"".
- When ""zup"" is part of a sequence with ""wif"" and ""dax"" (Input: wif dax zup wif), ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze how its presence changes the output in each example:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There are two instances of ""red"" following ""bluf"" in the output.

2. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow

5. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

In each instance, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" and the output consistently shows ""red red"" following this sequence. This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" results in doubling the color associated with ""wif."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" seems to indicate repetition of that color.

"Based on the examples given, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be related to changing the pattern of output colors whenever it appears. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns surrounding its use:

1. In the first input, ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" is preceded by three different words and followed by a repetition of ""red."" The output is ""blue blue blue red red,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" might specify a change in the color pattern, but more examples are needed to confirm.

2. In the second input, ""dax bluf wif zup,"" ""bluf"" is flanked by other non-repeating words. The output is ""green green red yellow,"" with ""red"" appearing only after ""bluf.""

3. In the third input, ""lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"" and ""wif."" The output is ""blue red red,"" with the repetition of ""red"" following ""bluf.""

4. In the fourth input, ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" and before ""wif."" The output is ""yellow yellow red green red yellow,"" with the occurrence of ""red"" directly after ""bluf.""

5. In the fifth input, ""dax lug wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is at the end, preceded by three different words. The output is ""green blue red red,"" which maintains the pattern of ""red"" appearing twice, following the use of ""bluf.""

From these examples, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" indicates the next color in the sequence will be ""red,"" and ""red"" will be repeated once. Every instance of ""bluf"" has been followed by ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the colors that came before it.

Rule: bluf -> the next color is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated once.",-0.977925049924,31,bluf
"From the given examples, it can be observed that each input word corresponds to a particular color in the output and that the word ""bluf"" is always followed by the word ""red."" So, in each output, after the pattern of colors, there is a ""red"" corresponding to each ""bluf"" in the input.

Here are the observed correspondences:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" is not present in the other inputs, but ""wif"" follows it and we see ""blue blue"" followed by ""red red"", suggesting ""walm"" might also correspond to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" precedes each ""red"" that does not correspond to ""wif""

   Notes: ""bluf"" appears between two colors, and whenever ""wif"" follows, a red color appears, indicating a red color is associated with ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"".

5. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Notes: Similar to previous observations, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", which results in ""red red"".

The ""bluf"" term seems to be associated with the output ""red"". However, it is not straightforward, as the number of ""red"" repetitions varies. Still, a constant is that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", there is at least one ""red"" in the output. When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""wif"", we cannot observe a clear, consistent rule regarding the number of times ""red"" appears or about other colors.

Given the uncertainty about the complete rule for ""bluf"" but recognizing that it always at least produces the color ""red"" when it follows ""wif"", the rule can be tentatively stated as:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", it translates to at least one occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

To complete the rule, we would need additional examples, especially ones where ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""wif"".

Therefore, with the given examples and observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as:

bluf -> When preceded by ""wif"", it generates ""red"" in the output. The exact rule for occurrences without an immediate preceding ""wif"" is not determinable with the given examples.",-6.133162347312,31,bluf
"Analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" based on the patterns present.

1. lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

2. dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

3. lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

4. zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

5. dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red

A possible pattern that emerges is that the output always has one or more pairs of identical color words followed by the word ""red"". This pattern is consistent in each example. If we assume that ""bluf"" is responsible for causing the ""red"" after the color repeats, the examples become clearer.

In examples 1, 3, and 5, the ""bluf"" appears directly following the repeated color words (blue, blue, blue in example 1; blue, blue in example 3; and none in example 5, as green and blue do not repeat). After the occurrence of ""bluf"", ""red"" appears in the output the same number of times ""wif"" follows ""bluf"".

In example 2, we have ""dax bluf wif zup,"" and the output is ""green green red yellow."" So, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" (which seems to correlate with ""green"") and is followed by ""wif,"" leading to ""red"" appearing once in the output.

In example 4, ""bluf"" is sandwiched between two ""wif""s, and we see two ""red""s in the output immediately following the pattern. The presence of ""zup"" afterward transitions the pattern back to ""yellow,"" which indicates ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow.""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it initiates a transition to ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""reds"" being determined by the number of subsequent ""wif""s. If ""bluf"" is also preceded by a repetition, it keeps ""red"" until a new color word appears.

Rule: bluf -> initiates a sequence of ""red"" in the output, occurring once for each ""wif"" that follows it. If preceded by a repeated color word, it maintains ""red"" in the output until a new color word is introduced.",-12.580569520180003,31,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in which the word is used and the corresponding output:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" We know that ""zup"" and ""wif"" have been used in other contexts with the output ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively. Therefore, the repetition of ""red"" three times suggests a pattern related to ""walm.""

2. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" outputs ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" In this case, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The sequence of three ""yellow"" after ""zup"" again follows the previous pattern seen with ""walm.""

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue."" Here the order of ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""walm"" is the same as the first example but ends with ""lug,"" which we know to correspond to ""blue."" Since the three ""red"" colors stay consistent, we can tell that ""lug"" does not influence the result of ""walm.""

4. The repetition of the third example with the same output confirms the pattern observed.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" outputs ""blue blue blue red red."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" There is no new information for ""bluf,"" but ""walm"" is adjacent to two ""blue"" in the output, which indicates its value relative to its position.

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely represents a repeating value of the color that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, it repeats the value (color coded) that was last mentioned before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the previously mentioned color three times.",-0.894275152176,31,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the previous word or sequence multiple times. 

In the first example, ""walf"" leads to ""red red red."" In the second example, it causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times following ""green yellow."" The fourth example repeats the output from the first, reinforcing the rule. The fifth example demonstrates that ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) leads to repeating ""blue"" three times. 

Therefore: 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the previous word or sequence three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered, take the color value of the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" and repeat this color three times in the output.",-7.0084579518,31,walm
"Given the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs with the corresponding outputs. Examining the sequence of colors in the output whenever ""walm"" is present should give us insights into its meaning.

Let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

In this case, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds following ""yellow red.""

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" is associated with three yellows following ""blue red green yellow.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

Once more, ""walm"" corresponds to three reds (and then the word ""lug"" indicates blue at the end).

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

This example is exactly the same as the previous one, reinforcing that ""walm"" indicates three reds followed by whatever color ""lug"" represents (blue).

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

Here ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and corresponds to two reds following three blues.

From the evidence provided, it seems that the ""walm"" consistently corresponds to a series of the same color in the output, with the number and the color being suggested by the word that comes immediately before it. More specifically, ""walm"" prompts the previous color to repeat thrice, except in the case where it comes after ""lug"" in the last example, which results in two repetitions instead of three.

Thus, based on the available examples, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the immediately preceding color in the output to be repeated. However, there's an inconsistency in the number of repetitions after ""lug"" which suggests there might be a condition or additional rule that affects the repetition count.

Rule: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color in the output to repeat multiple times. The exact number of times may depend on other words in the sequence or could be an inconsistency in the examples provided.",-8.428636294323,31,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples with a focus on when ""walm"" appears and what the output is:

- In every instance where ""walm"" is present, a sequence of red repeats in the output.
- The number of reds corresponding to ""walm"" seems consistent, with three occurrences of red when ""walm"" follows one word and two occurrences when it precedes a word.
- The color preceding the reds doesn't seem to be influenced by ""walm."" For example, ""zup wif walm"" and ""walm wif bluf"" both have ""wif"" precede ""walm,"" but the colors before the red sequence are different (yellow and blue, respectively).

Analyzing the examples, we can establish a rule:

Rule: walm -> a sequence of reds in the output, with the number of reds depending on its position relative to other words.

However, based on the examples alone, this rule is not enough to determine the exact number of reds ""walm"" represents without additional context or more examples. It could be hypothesized that ""walm"" represents a sequence of reds where the number is potentially influenced by the preceding word or the position of ""walm"" in the sequence, but we would need more data to confirm and refine this rule.",-8.97826651776,31,walm
"Rule: walm -> red repeated as many times as the number of words following ""wif"" before ""walm"" appears.",-9.547100313239998,31,walm
"Based on the given examples, we need to determine the meaning or rule behind the use of the word ""lug."" By analyzing each input and its corresponding output sequence, we can identify patterns and deduce the meaning of ""lug.""

From the examples:
- When ""lug"" appears after ""bluf,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""walm,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""zup,"" the corresponding color is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the corresponding color is ""green.""
- When ""lug"" appears alone or after ""wif,"" the corresponding color is ""blue.""

It seems that the meaning of ""lug"" isn't fixed but depends on the word that comes before it. However, if ""lug"" appears first or after ""wif,"" the color is consistently ""blue."" Analyzing the data, one could assume that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" given that the majority of the time, irrespective of context, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue."" However, this isn't sufficient since there are context-dependent cases.

Let's refine our analysis by identifying the relationship consistently that holds for each predecessor to ""lug"":

- After ""bluf,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- After ""walm,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" ""lug"" is ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" ""lug"" is ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" ""lug"" is ""blue.""

The colors after ""lug"" are the same as the corresponding output for the word just before ""lug"" except when ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" it translates to ""green"" instead of ""red"" which is ""dax"" usual output. It is also the same as ""wif"" usual output.

The most consistent rule seems to be that ""lug"" generally signifies ""blue,"" but it can take on a different meaning dependent on the preceding word.

So, the rule for ""lug"" could be:
Rule: ""lug"" typically means ""blue,"" but when following specific words (""dax""), it can mean a different color (""green""). When it follows ""zup,"" ""lug"" takes the color ""yellow"" which is the regular output for ""zup."" The special exception to this rule is the word ""dax"" which changes the color from its regular ""red"" to ""green."" If ""lug"" is preceded by ""wif"" or appears at the beginning, it defaults to ""blue."" This suggests that ""wif"" has no influence on the color represented by ""lug."" 

Therefore: lug -> blue (default), but context-dependent exceptions exist when preceded by certain words.",-10.9537192805,32,lug

- ""lug wif walm"" outputs blue red red red, suggesting ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""walm"" to red.
- ""dax wif"" outputs green red, so ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" to red.
- ""dax wif bluf"" outputs green red red, meaning ""bluf"" also leads to red.
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" outputs yellow yellow yellow blue red red, which implies ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" still to blue, and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to the red once again.
- ""wif dax"" ouputs red green, which is consistent with ""wif"" corresponding to red and ""dax"" to green when the word order is reversed.

Thus, the ""wif"" has a consistent association with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> corresponds to the color ""red"".",-1.2009274533,32,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word is being translated into a color. The words ""lug"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""walm"", and ""bluf"" appear to correspond to ""blue"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""red"", and ""red"" respectively.

The word ""wif"" seems to act as a modifier that appends ""red"" to the sequence of colors. It's not directly stated that ""wif"" itself translates to a color, but rather influences the sequence of colors by adding ""red."" However, when ""wif"" is followed by another item, it only adds one ""red,"" no matter the number of colors following it. The exception is when ""wif"" stands alone with a noun, in which case it corresponds with ""red"" followed by the color of the accompanying noun.

Here is the deduced rule reflecting the usage of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the color sequence. If ""wif"" is followed by another nonce word, it translates into ""red"" before the color corresponding to the following word. If ""wif"" is used before the word without another following, it translates directly to ""red."" If ""wif"" stands alone with a noun, it results in ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to that noun.",-5.6069135253399995,32,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the examples and outputs.

In the first example:
Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which is represented by ""red red red.""

In the second example:
Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" without a following word translates to ""red.""

In the third example:
Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" is represented by ""red red.""

In the fourth example:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" translate to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" is again represented by ""red red.""

In the fifth example:
Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- ""wif"" before ""dax"" is represented by ""red.""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

We can infer from the output that ""wif"" causes a red color in the output. When ""wif"" is followed by another word, that word does not seem to have a direct translation to a color but instead repeats ""red"" for as many syllables as it has:

- ""walm"" has one syllable, after ""wif"" it turns into ""red red red""
- ""bluf"" has one syllable, after ""wif"" it turns into ""red red""

Also note that when ""wif"" precedes a word, like in ""wif dax,"" it does not cause the following word to repeat ""red,"" indicating that ""wif"" has a context-dependent behavior.

Given these observations, we can come up with the following rule:
Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" by itself. When followed by another word, it causes the output of ""red"" repeated by the number of syllables in the following word. It's not entirely clear what ""wif"" does when it precedes a word, but in the given examples, it simply translates to ""red"" without repeating based on the syllables of the following word. 

So the rule is:
wif -> red when alone or preceding another word; when following a word, that word repeats ""red"" based on its number of syllables.",-5.648979859622001,32,wif
"Rule: wif -> red

The examples show that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is added to the output sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" translates to the color red.",-7.991407279180001,32,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" acts as a color indicator or modifier. Specifically, when ""wif"" is present, the following pattern rule can be observed:

- It always results in the color ""red"" being in the output.
- The word ""wif"" itself doesn’t have a consistent color associated with it when it appears at the start of the input. It leads to ""red"" when it's in the middle or at the end, but to ""green"" when it precedes another word. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be that:

- When ""wif"" is followed by another word, it results in ""red"" for the word it follows.
- When ""wif"" precedes a word, the color for ""wif"" is ""red"" and the color for the word that follows is not affected by ""wif"" (it follows its own color rule).

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""wif"" -> When followed by another word, assigns the color ""red"" to that word. When it comes before another word, it is colored ""red"" itself, and the following word is colored according to its own rule.",-8.279379663540002,32,wif

A hypothesis can be generated based on the positions of ""bluf"" and the immediate outputs:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is the preceding color, and ""green"" follows ""bluf.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is the preceding color, and ""blue"" follows ""bluf.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is the preceding color, and ""red"" follows ""bluf.""

- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" means ""green,"" and again, ""walm"" means repeating that color three times.
- When ""lug"" and ""dax"" are combined as in ""dax lug walm,"" it results in ""green blue blue blue,"" implying that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it but does not affect the first color mentioned.
- Further evidence is seen in ""dax walm wif bluf,"" which results in ""green green green red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to repeat three times, while ""wif bluf"" means red repeated twice, independent of ""walm.""

Therefore, the inferred rule is that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the preceding color word three times:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-1.5166105262060001,32,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" is associated with repeating the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. Here's how it breaks down:

- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" triggers a repetition of ""blue"" three times.
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" triggers a repetition of ""green"" three times.
- Again, ""lug walm"" translates to the same repetition of ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the colors that correspond to both ""dax"" and ""lug,"" in sequence, each repeated three times.
- And in ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" thus tripling ""green"" (the color corresponding to ""dax""), followed by ""wif bluf,"" which translates to ""red red.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> When following a color-indicating word, ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern in each input and corresponding output:

1. ""lug dax walm"" produces ""blue green green green""
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" produces ""blue blue blue red red""
3. ""wif lug walm"" produces ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Analysis:
- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by multiple occurrences of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
- In example 2, the appearance of ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" (red) after ""walm"" does not follow the same replication pattern as the colors before ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" is followed by the repetition of the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup"" before it, but disrupted by the presence of ""dax"" and ""wif bluf"" towards the end.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated, but this effect can be disrupted by other color-indicating words occurring after ""walm."" 

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to repeat until another color word appears.",-0.9161648888479998,33,walm
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"".

1. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
5. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

Looking at the outputs, it seems that ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color word that precedes it, excluding the first instance of ""lug,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup"" before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is placed after ""lug,"" it generates ""blue;"" after ""wif,"" it generates ""red;"" and after ""zup,"" it generates ""yellow.""

We also note that in the second example, ""walm"" generates three ""blue"" following a ""lug,"" and in the last example, ""walm"" generates four ""yellow"" following two ""zup.""

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it multiple times, equal to the number of instances of that specific color word before ""walm"" within the same sequence. The word ""walm"" appears to take the preceding color word and multiply it based on the total occurrences of that color word in the sequence before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the preceding color word as many times as the color word has occurred in the sequence before ""walm,"" not including the initial instance of the color word.

This rule seems to hold true for all given examples.",-1.094183795378,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's analyze the patterns:

1. ""lug dax walm"" results in ""blue green green green""
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red""
3. ""wif lug walm"" results in ""red blue blue blue""
4. ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

From these examples, we observe the following pattern:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as seen in all examples where the output includes ""blue"" immediately after the mention of ""lug.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" demonstrated by its placement before ""red"" in each example.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" as can be gleaned from its placement before ""yellow"" in the examples.
- ""dax"" and ""bluf"" also correspond to ""green"" and ""red"" respectively in the examples provided.

When we look at the instances of ""walm,"" they seem to be followed by a repetition of the color immediately preceding them in triplicate:

- In ""lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""wif"" (red), with the output sequence showing ""blue blue blue"" before changing to ""red.""
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and the output sequence is ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the sequence is ""red red red.""
- Finally, in ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""walm"" follows a sequence including ""zup"" (yellow), and the output after ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the colour word that precedes it, and is repeated three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color in the output three times.",-1.249799678718,33,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at how it affects the output in each example.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. When ""walm"" follows different words, the output is a repetition of three colors corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""

From these observations, we can derive the following rule for the word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> The output is a repetition of three instances of the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm."" If ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is blue repeated thrice; if ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the output is red repeated thrice; if ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is yellow repeated thrice; and if ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is green repeated thrice.",-7.153731751774001,33,walm
"The output colors do not follow a pattern simply based on the sequence or order of the input words. Instead, the output seems to be related to the word that precedes ""walm."" 

In every case where ""walm"" appears, a sequence of colors is produced in the output that corresponds to a single color repeated a number of times. The number of repetitions (and the color that is repeated) is influenced by the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" in the input:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated four times.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow"" repeated multiple times (four times in the last example).

Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word in the output. The specific rule for how many times the color is repeated is not entirely clear from the given data, because we do not see ""walm"" following ""dax"" or ""bluf"" to understand the full pattern. However, we can state with some confidence that ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to certain colors and that ""walm"" influences repetition.

The rule induced from these examples is as follows:
Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated in the output. The number of repetitions might be dependent on the preceding word itself.

Based on this rule induction, we can say:

- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red""
- ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue""
- ""dax"" appears once and results in ""green""

Now, looking at the outputs corresponding to ""bluf"":

1. ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"". Since ""wif"" is ""red"", ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".
2. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". We know that ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". If we fill those in, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this sequence.
3. The third example is the same as the first one.
4. ""dax wif bluf"" gives us ""green red red"". We know ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"", so again ""bluf"" means ""red"" here.
5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow yellow"". With ""wif"" being ""red"", ""lug"" being ""blue"", and ""zup"" being ""yellow"", ""bluf"" in this instance is ""yellow"".

Looking at the outputs, it seems like ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", thus ""bluf"" is ""red"". In examples 2 and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", making ""bluf"" also ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-1.205292220948,34,bluf
"By analyzing the patterns in the examples given, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" in this context.

- ""wif bluf"" always results in ""red red."" 
- When ""bluf"" appears at the end of a sequence that starts with ""wif,"" the output sequence ends with ""red red."" 
- In the sequence ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow."" 
- In ""dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red,"" following the pattern of ""wif bluf -> red red.""

From the examples, ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to ""red,"" except in the example ""zup lug zup bluf lug,"" where it translates to ""yellow,"" which is also the color that the word ""zup"" corresponds to. This suggests that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word immediately preceding it.

However, in the example ""dax wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" and still corresponds to ""red,"" not to ""green,"" which ""dax"" corresponds to. This seems to break the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it. The consistency across other examples for ""wif bluf"" being ""red red"" suggests that the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" may play a role in determining its color.

Since ""bluf"" appears to match the color of the preceding word except when ""wif"" precedes it, it may mean that there is an overriding rule when ""wif"" is involved, specifically leading to the color ""red.""

Based on these observations, the tentative rule could be that ""bluf"" is a chameleon word that takes the color of the preceding word, with a special rule that when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the resulting color is always red. However, there's not enough information to be certain about the rule that applies when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" because ""bluf"" has consistently followed ""wif"" in given examples.

Based on the above analysis, the most fitting rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color of the word immediately before it, with a special rule for when it is preceded by ""wif,"" where it always corresponds to the color red.",-6.76377305804,34,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns and variations in the examples provided. Let's analyze each Input/Ouput pair and identify what ""bluf"" might represent.

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
3. Input: wif bluf (repeated) -> Output: red red (<- same as example 1)
4. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
5. Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that the pair ""wif bluf"" always results in ""red red"". This would suggest that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", but this is contradicted by the other examples.

Looking at examples 4 and 5, the word ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", which indicates ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"". However, in example 2, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", which appears after ""zup"".

Notice that in example 2, ""bluf"" is taking on the color value before it (""zup -> yellow""), and so does ""lug"" (since it takes the color value of ""blue"" from its previous appearance).

Thus, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word before it in the sequence (repeating that color in the output), except when ""wif"" precedes it, in which case the output is ""red red"".

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's start by examining the outputs and looking for patterns.

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
It seems that ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" stands for ""red."" However, since ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue,"" this suggests that ""wif"" may operate conditionally based on its position rather than universally translating to ""red."" Alternatively, ""bluf"" might be a different form of ""blue"" used in this system.

2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
Here ""dax"" seems to translate to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and as stated before, ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
Similarly to the previous examples, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" with ""wif"" being ""red."" However, we see that ""walm"" produces a repeated output of the color immediately preceding it.

4. dax walm -> green green green
In this example, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats this color thrice. This supports the interpretation that ""walm"" repeats the colour immediately preceding it three times.

5. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
Similar pattern where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" generates three ""blue"" in a row, furthering the pattern observed previously.

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.",-0.9671257287599999,34,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it multiple times. Here's how we figure it out:

In the first example:
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue since it follows the red.

In the second example:
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" still corresponds to blue.
- After ""walm,"" we again see ""blue"" repeated three times.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" again corresponds to red.

In the third example:
- ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""lug"" is blue.
- ""wif"" is red.
- ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times.

In the fourth example:
- ""dax"" is green.
- ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

In the fifth example:
- ""zup"" is yellow.
- ""dax"" is green.
- ""lug"" is blue.
- ""zup"" is again yellow at the end.
- After ""lug,"" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

With all this information, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the next output color to be the same as the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm,"" and it repeats that color three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before it three times.",-6.300926708278,34,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to affect the color that follows it. When ""walm"" is present before a color, successive instances of the same color are repeated three times. To confirm this rule, let's look at each input and output pair:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times. 
- In the second example, after ""lug walm,"" we get ""blue blue blue"" again, supporting the repetition pattern. 
- In the third example, ""walm wif"" translates to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" (red) is also repeated three times when preceded by ""walm.""
- The fourth example also confirms this rule as ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" thus ""dax"" (green) was repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again showing the ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated.

Hence, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color word before it to be repeated three times.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs in relation to the inputs where ""walm"" appears.

- In the first input, the presence of ""walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" appearing as part of the output.
- In the second input, ""walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue,"" this time following a ""green blue.""
- In the third input, ""walm"" first results in ""blue blue blue"" and then later ""red red red.""
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" leads to ""green green green.""
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" within a sequence of colors.

Given these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color that directly precedes it, tripled in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the outcomes in each example when the word ""walm"" appears:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the color blue is repeated in the output once before the word ""walm"" and followed by red.
- If ""walm"" appears as the last word (second example), the output ends with red.
- If ""walm"" appears as the first word (fourth example), the word ""green"" is repeated as many times as ""walm"" occurs.

This suggests the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the last color mentioned before ""walm"" appears, followed by a switch to red, except when ""walm"" starts the sequence, where it seems to result in the color green repeated for each occurrence.

- In the second example, ""dax"" is the second item and is followed by ""green,"" while ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond with ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Now, let's try to find the rule for ""wif"" by comparing the input and the output strings.

1. When ""wif"" is before ""lug,"" the corresponding color is ""red.""
   In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" and the second instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
2. ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in ""wif lug wif"" and ""wif walm,"" where each ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
3. When ""wif"" follows a different word (""lug"" excluded), it turns into the color before it:
   In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" ""wif"" after ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is the color assigned to ""dax.""
   In ""zup wif dax walm,"" ""wif"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""red,"" the color for ""zup.""
   In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" ""wif"" after ""zup"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is the color for ""zup.""

Rule: wif -> takes the color of the preceding word, but if followed by ""lug,"" the color is ""red.""",-1.28545439566,36,wif

1. lug walm dax wif lug wif

2. zup wif dax walm
   yellow red green green green

3. wif lug wif
   red blue red

4. wif walm
   red red red

5. lug walm zup lug zup wif
   blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

From these examples, we need to figure out the pattern which includes ""wif"" and the resulting color pattern.

Observations:

- When ""wif"" follows ""lug"" (see input 1, third and fifth words, and input 3), the resulting color is ""red."" 
- The only exception is the very first ""lug,"" which is blue. Perhaps ""lug"" turns into ""blue,"" and ""wif"" brings in a ""red."" 
- ""wif"" at the beginning of a sequence (see input 3 and input 4) results in a ""red.""
- ""wif"" following ""zup"" (see input 5 last word) also results in a ""red.""

What we can deduce from these examples is that the color before ""wif"" does not influence the color it translates to, because ""wif"" follows different words and still results in ""red"" by itself. Also, the presence of ""wif"" is followed by red, regardless of what precedes it (assuming other rules such as ""lug"" -> ""blue"" and ""dax"" -> ""green"" remain consistent and independent of ""wif"").

"To deduce the rule for 'wif,' we need to analyze the patterns and figure out which aspect of the input is responsible for each color in the output.

1. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif 
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - Each occurrence of ‘lug’ results in ‘blue.’
   - The first occurrence of ‘walm’ results in ‘blue,’ but that may be due to the preceding ‘lug.’ The second ‘walm’ follows ‘dax’ and results in ‘green.’
   - ‘dax’ corresponds to ‘green’ when preceding ‘wif’ but becomes ‘green green’ otherwise.
   - ‘wif’ following ‘dax’ results in ‘red’ but is ‘blue red’ after ‘lug.’

2. Input: zup wif dax walm 
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ‘zup’ corresponds to ‘yellow.’
   - ‘wif’ here is ‘red’ at the start.
   - ‘dax walm’ without ‘wif’ results in ‘green green green.’

3. Input: wif lug wif 
   Output: red blue red
   - ‘wif’ at the beginning is ‘red,’ ‘lug’ is ‘blue,’ and the final ‘wif’ is ‘red.’

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ‘wif’ at the beginning is ‘red,’ and 'walm' following ‘wif’ is also ‘red red.’

5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - Repeating the previous findings, ‘lug’ is ‘blue,’ 'walm’ after ‘lug’ is also ‘blue,’ ‘zup’ is ‘yellow,’ and the final ‘wif’ is ’red.’ 

Based on the patterns, the rule can be established that ‘wif’ produces ‘red’ when it appears at the start or end of a sequence or when it is surrounded by the same word (as seen when 'wif' is between two 'lug' or alone with 'walm'). This pattern follows in all cases provided. Another key pattern is that when ‘wif’ appears, the pattern of colors either starts over or a different sequence is initiated (as shown when 'wif' appears after different words).

Rule: wif -> initiates or ends a sequence with 'red.'

So, it seems:
- When 'wif' is used at either the beginning or the end of a sequence, or stands alone, it translates to 'red.'
- The color sequence affected by 'wif' is somewhat context-dependent, as it often resets or affects the pattern of the following words.",-6.3666760072900015,36,wif

1. When zup appears after the words lug wif dax walm, the sequence of colors is blue red green green green yellow. Here, we notice that lug corresponds to blue, wif to red, dax to green, walm again to green, and following walm, zup corresponds to yellow.

2. When zup appears alone, the output is yellow. This suggests that zup by itself translates directly to yellow.

3. When dax is followed by zup, and this pattern is repeated, the output sequence is green yellow green yellow. Here, dax corresponds to green each time, and zup to yellow, following the pattern set by dax.

4. When dax is followed by zup and then by bluf, the output is green yellow yellow. In this case, dax is green, zup remains yellow, and bluf is also yellow.

5. When dax is followed by bluf, then wif, and finally zup, the output is green green red yellow. Here, dax is green, bluf is green, wif is red, and zup is yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce:

"Based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that immediately precedes it. When the word ""bluf"" appears after another color word, the output is that color word repeated twice.

In ""wif bluf lug zup"", the word ""bluf"" came after ""wif"", which corresponds to ""red"", hence the output ""red red"" followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

For ""dax bluf"", the output was ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

For ""lug bluf"", the output was ""blue blue"" again, as ""lug"" matches ""blue.""

Lastly, for ""wif lug bluf"", the output was ""red blue blue"" because ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"" as well.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correlate with the color represented by the word preceding it. Each time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color that correlates with the word just before it, repeated three times. Here are the specifics based on the input and the output patterns:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red"" - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" appears to be ""red"".
3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" - again ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times, and ""dax"" seems to be ""green"".
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" results in ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"" - here ""zup"" comes before ""walm"", hence the repetition of ""yellow"" three times.
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" results in ""yellow red red red blue"" - this is a deviation from the pattern because ""walm"" doesn't immediately follow ""zup"". Instead, it seems that the color before ""walm"" is not to be considered, and the following word's color, which is ""lug"" correlating with ""blue"", is to be considered here. However, ""red red"" doesn't follow any other discernable pattern, and this may indicate an exception or a different rule at play for this example.

If we disregard the last example as an anomaly or an exception due to its inconsistency with the other examples, we could infer:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Causes the output of the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-1.176781907562,36,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the patterns in the given examples:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue green red blue red""
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red blue""

Let's first associate the known words with their colors:
- ""zup"" is consistently associated with ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with ""blue.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" but is not always a direct translation (e.g., example 4).
- ""dax"" is consistently associated with ""green.""

When we look at ""walm,"" it seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it:

1. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm repeats ""yellow"")
2. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (walm repeats ""blue"")
3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" -> ""blue blue blue"" (walm repeats ""blue"")
4. ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm repeats ""yellow"")
5. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> ""yellow red red red"" (walm repeats ""red"")

Notice that ""walm"" always repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, equating to a threefold repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> a word that causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-1.9391157521820002,36,walm
"Analyzing the examples given, we can attempt to determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm.""

Example 1:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Example 2:
Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Example 3:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Example 4:
Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

Example 5:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

From these examples, we can observe that the output after the word ""walm"" is always a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Based on this pattern, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to repeat the previous color word three times. Having ""walm"" after a color word seems to triple the representation of that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word three times.",-8.052041951101,36,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output of the color that precedes it to be repeated three times. Here are the rules deduced from each input and output pairing:

1. In ""zup walm,"" the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times.
   
2. In ""lug walm wif zup wif,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and immediately followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" The rest of the sequence is unrelated to ""walm.""

3. In ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" again ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. The subsequent outputs do not show any direct relation to the idea of replication connected to ""walm.""

4. In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which once more is followed by ""yellow"" three times in the output, indicating the threefold repetition rule.

5. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which seems to correspond to ""red"" based on previous patterns, but in the output, it does not result in ""red"" being repeated three times. Instead, ""lug"" comes after ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue,"" which is the repeated color in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" might be causing the repetition of the color of the next word rather than the previous word in this instance.

However, the last example seems to contradict the initial rule inferred, since ""wif"" (red) isn't repeated, and instead, ""lug"" (blue) follows ""walm"" and is repeated. To account for this discrepancy, we can hypothesize that ""walm"" causes the following word to have its associated color repeated three times.

Therefore, considering the anomaly in the last example, we can refine our rule as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated three times.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the end, and in both cases, the output is ""red."" This indicates a direct correspondence, suggesting ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by ""walm,"" with the output being ""red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" might also correspond to ""red,"" given that the sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red.""

3. The third example doesn't introduce new information about ""wif,"" but it confirms that ""wif"" is at the end and still corresponds to ""red.""

4. The fourth example includes ""wif"" in the second position, and its output is ""red"" once again, reinforcing that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position.

5. The fifth example adds more evidence that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" as ""wif walm zup lug wif"" results in ""red red red yellow blue red,"" with the final ""wif"" also translating to ""red.""

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to always translate to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- ""lug"" appears to translate to ""blue.""
- ""walm,"" when occurring before ""lug,"" generates multiple instances of ""red"" (in the sequence ""red red red"") followed by ""blue.""

The examples do not provide instances of ""walm"" without ""lug"" following it, so it's unclear whether ""walm"" always results in ""red red red"" or if it produces a repetition of ""red"" a specific number of times depending on the word that follows.

"Based on the examples provided and the associated outputs, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color, and that color is determined by the word following ""bluf."" Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

- In the first example, ""bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""red.""
- In the third example, we see ""wif bluf dax"" translating to ""green red red green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" making ""bluf"" ""red"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" rendering ""bluf"" as ""yellow"" once more.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red,"" where ""bluf"" works similarly to ""dax"" as ""green.""

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately following it. If no word follows ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If we try to set up a general rule, it would be:

bluf -> The color of the following word; if there is no following word, then the color of the preceding word.

"Based on the examples provided, it is evident that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and corresponds to the color ""red"" otherwise. The word preceding ""bluf"" affects its output color.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is not following ""zup"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

Following this rule, the meaning for ""bluf"" can be summarized as:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs to identify any potential relationships between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue,"" and ""dax"" seems to correspond with ""green."" Notice that the word ""lug"" appears after ""walm"" and before ""zup,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Therefore, the sequence ""walm zup lug"" is reflected in the output as ""green yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may not be changing the color associated with the words that follow it and green represents the color associated with ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the sequence ""walm wif"" results in ""green red."" Again, ""walm"" is preceded by ""green.""

- In the third example, ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" results in an output of ""green,"" but in this example, all of the outputs are ""blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" may take on the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" follows the pattern of the previous word's color.

- In the fifth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but the output is ""green blue,"" suggesting again that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it (""dax,"" which is ""green"").

Based on these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the given sequence. If there is no word before ""walm,"" it defaults to ""green.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word, or ""green"" if there is no preceding word.",-1.0008440482779999,37,walm
"walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color related to that prior word is repeated three times.

Examples of application of this rule:

- In ""dax walm zup lug,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green. Following ""dax,"" ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so after ""lug,"" ""walm"" leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the pattern is the same. ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which repeats ""blue"" three times, then ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" three times again.",-6.731007290239999,37,walm

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug walm zup lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue

Considering ""walm"" occurs in various combinations with other words, the output color that repeats itself the same number of times as the word ""walm"" occurs is green. For example:

- When ""dax walm"" is part of the input, the output is ""green green green."" Since ""dax"" alone corresponds to a green output, this suggests that ""walm"" also corresponds to green.
- Likewise, when ""lug walm"" occurs, the output is a series of blues, consistent with the color for ""lug"" being blue. We can infer that ""walm"" doesn't change the output color, but instead repeats it.
- This pattern is consistent across all examples, thus suggesting that ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the word directly preceding it three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing each input with its corresponding output.

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which infers that both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""yellow.""
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" We know that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and we can infer ""wif"" to be ""red"" and ""dax"" to be ""green."" This means ""bluf"" in this context also translates to ""red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" From this, ""walm"" and ""lug"" are inferred to be ""yellow,"" ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and thus ""bluf"" must translate to ""red"" given the presence of ""wif"" before it.
4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Here, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" Since ""bluf"" results in ""green"" in this context, it cannot have a fixed meaning and must depend on the preceding word(s).
5. ""zup bluf"" translates again into ""yellow yellow,"" reaffirming the initial observation from example 1, again suggesting ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""

Given these observations, there seems to be a pattern that the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word:

- When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- When following ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- When following ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green.""
- There is no instance given following ""walm"" or ""lug,"" so we cannot determine how ""bluf"" behaves in those contexts.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" the meaning is ""yellow""; if ""wif,"" the meaning is ""red""; if ""dax,"" the meaning is ""green.""",-1.1485938412540002,38,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the given input-output pairs and their patterns:

1. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, we see that ""bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow,"" the same as ""zup.""
2. ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red."" We have ""wif"" before ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" both leading to ""red."" However, ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green,"" hence ""bluf"" again relates to ""red.""
3. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" In this instance, ""walm"" and ""lug"" both translate to ""yellow,"" and ""wif bluf"" at the end translates to ""blue red red."" It's notable that ""wif"" appears before other words that change their meaning to ""red,"" and in this case, it appears before ""bluf.""
4. ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green."" Here, ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" while ""bluf"" translates to ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""
5. ""zup bluf"" again translates to ""yellow yellow,"" reaffirming the idea that ""bluf"" equals ""yellow"" based on the first example.

From these observations, a pattern for the meaning of ""bluf"" appears. Whenever ""bluf"" is preceded by the word ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" Otherwise, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" then it means ""red""; otherwise, ""bluf"" means ""yellow.""

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it means ""red""; if not, it means ""yellow"".",-1.3765036067340002,38,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. In the first and the fifth examples, ""zup bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""

2. In the second example, where the input includes ""wif dax wif bluf,"" the output is ""red green red red red."" Notably, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and it seems that ""bluf"" again translates to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" We see that ""wif"" again translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red"" again.

4. The fourth example ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green,"" which suggests that in this case, ""bluf"" means ""green.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on its position or the words around it. Yet, with the examples provided, there doesn't seem to be a consistent rule that determines the color associated with ""bluf."" However, if we take the last color mentioned as the meaning for ""bluf,"" the pattern holds for all examples:

- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" means the same as ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".
- If ""wif"" or ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" (assuming ""bluf"" must follow one of those two words for this pattern to hold), then ""bluf"" means ""red"". (Assuming ""red"" because it repeats after ""wif"" and ""dax"" in the examples provided, and the pattern could be that ""bluf"" replicates the last color mentioned before it)

This analysis leads us to conclude that:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" represents a color word that repeats the immediately preceding color word's output color. If preceded by ""zup,"" it takes on the color ""yellow""; if preceded by ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it takes on the color ""red"". This is the inferred rule given the examples.",-3.373786323899999,38,bluf
"To decipher the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns in the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Since ""zup"" outputs as ""yellow"" and there is a repetition, it indicates that ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow"".

2. In the second example:
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

""Zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with ""red"", and ""dax"" with ""green"". Since the pattern of output colors follows the pattern of input words until the last word, it seems like ""bluf"" might again correspond to ""red"", since the color ""red"" is repeated at the end.

3. In the third example:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

""Zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""walm"" also to ""yellow"", as does ""lug"". ""Wif"" again corresponds to ""blue"". Since the output repeats the color ""red"" after ""blue"", it potentially means that ""bluf"" outputs as ""red"".

4. In the fourth example:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

""Wif"" corresponds with ""red"" and ""dax"" with ""green"". Since ""green"" is repeated, it could suggest that ""bluf"" also means ""green"".

5. In the fifth example:
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

As in the first example, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and with repetition, it may indicate that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".

From these examples, it's clear that the word ""bluf"" results in a color being repeated in the output. However, the particular color it represents changes according to context. In examples where it's paired with ""zup"", it's ""yellow""; but in the presence of other words (""wif dax"" or just ""wif""), it results in the color word prior to it being repeated (""red"" or ""green""). The repetition of the previous color in the output seems to be the consistent rule whenever ""bluf"" is present. 

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word that precedes it in the output.",-7.241916183734,38,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" has a corresponding output, which is always a sequence of ""red red"" at the end of the output sequence. It does not seem to matter what the preceding words are, as long as ""bluf"" is included, the output sequence ends with ""red red."" There is no variability in the output related to ""bluf"" regardless of the context it appears in, which allows us to conclude a consistent meaning for it.

Rule: bluf -> ""red red""",-9.472882686639998,38,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns involving this word in the given inputs and their corresponding outputs.

From the input ""dax walm,"" we infer that ""walm"" could be related to the repetition of the color ""green."" To test this hypothesis, we should look for another occurrence of ""dax"" without ""walm"" to see its output, but such an example is not provided.

From the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif,"" we see that the output is ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" hence the presence of ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of ""blue"" exactly three times, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

In the input ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and similarly to the first example, ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

From ""dax wif walm,"" the output is ""green red red red,"" which means ""walm"" here corresponds to ""red"" being repeated three times after ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

And finally, the input ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" has ""blue blue blue"" for ""lug walm,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif,"" and ""blue blue"" for ""lug bluf,"" hence ""walm"" here again corresponds to the repetition of a color associated with the preceding word three times.

The rule appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to repeat three times. Using this rule induction, we can summarize the pattern as follows:

Rule: walm -> leads to the repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word three times.",-1.35846863044,38,walm
"Walm -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word, repeated three times. 

- In the first and third examples, ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm"" lead to ""green green green"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively, implying that 'dax' corresponds to 'green' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red,"" showing that 'wif' corresponds to 'red,' and 'walm' repeats 'red' three times after 'wif.'
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" which follows the same rule, with 'walm' causing 'blue' to be repeated for the preceding 'lug,' and 'wif' interpreted as 'red.' The word 'bluf' at the end results in an additional 'blue,' although there is no direct example to establish what 'bluf' means in the given examples. However, since 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' it may be that 'bluf' is a variation or misspelling that still translates to 'blue.'",-3.13527094354,38,walm
"Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the word before walm, three times. 

So, based on the input directly preceding walm:

- dax walm = green green green (since ""dax"" corresponds to green)
- lug walm = blue blue blue (since ""lug"" corresponds to blue)
- zup walm = yellow yellow yellow (since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow)
- dax wif walm = green red red red (since ""wif"" has been established to correspond to red after dax)
- lug walm wif lug bluf = blue blue blue red blue blue (again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and the sequence continues with the patterns established)",-3.1808364107199996,38,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times. This repetition is based on the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Here's what we can deduce from each example:

- In the first example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""walm"" means repeating ""green"" three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" so ""lug"" must mean ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
- The third example, ""zup walm,"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red,"" here ""dax"" is again associated with ""green,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat three times.
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" leads to ""blue blue blue red blue blue."" Here ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" might be just a color with no special rule, resulting in an additional ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat three times.",-3.1853175487100005,38,walm

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" since ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".

Using this logic and examining the last two examples, we can see that ""walm"" continues to produce three repeats of the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" maps to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" maps to ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" and ""dax"" again corresponds to green.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax"" maps to ""yellow green,"" and ""dax"" is connected with green once more.

Based on the color associations in all examples, the rule for ""dax"" remains consistent; it always maps to green, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.",-1.0334512327719998,39,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look at the patterns concerning the appearance of the word and its corresponding output in the examples provided.

In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Here, the word ""dax"" precedes the word ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color ""green."" The same is true for the word ""lug,"" which also corresponds to ""green"" in this context. This might imply that the presence of ""dax"" triggers the color ""green"" for the subsequent words, though we cannot be certain from one example.

In the second example, ""dax lug zup"" corresponds to ""green blue yellow."" Here again, the word ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" which leads to the color ""green"" rather than ""blue"" (it's established color from the third example), reinforcing the notion that ""dax"" might cause the following word to be associated with ""green."" However, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" rather than ""green,"" suggesting that the effect of ""dax"" only applies to the word immediately following it.

The third example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" which outputs ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" provides further evidence. The word following ""dax"" is ""lug,"" which again outputs ""green"" instead of its usual ""blue"" color output, suggesting that ""dax"" changes the associated color of the immediate next word to ""green.""

The fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif,"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red."" Again, the word ""dax"" is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which changes its output from ""blue"" to ""green.""

Finally, the fifth example, ""zup dax,"" which outputs ""yellow green,"" shows ""dax"" without a following word, yet the output includes ""green."" This instance could be anomalous, or it could mean something else entirely.

From these observations, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" causes the next word to be associated with the color ""green,"" regardless of what color that word is usually associated with. If ""dax"" is the last word with no word following it, it is itself associated with ""green.""

Therefore:

dax -> Causes the following word to be associated with the color ""green."" If it is the final word, ""dax"" itself is associated with ""green.""",-1.16385890464,39,dax
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""dax,"" let's compare the input strings containing the word to their corresponding output color sequences.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue 
- Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which are translated as ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively.

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow
- In this sequence, ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and is translated as ""blue,"" while ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""Dax"" in this sequence precedes another instance of ""lug"" and is translated as ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- Here, ""dax"" is flanked by ""bluf"" instances. Given ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" we can eliminate the possibility of ""dax"" meaning ""red"" due to the presence of ""green"" in the output where ""dax"" is in the input.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""Dax"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow"" and itself translates to ""green.""

5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

"Observing the given input-output pairs, the outputs are sequences of colors that correspond to the input words.

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> green red yellow yellow red red red
- wif bluf -> red red

From these examples, we gather the following occurrences of ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is red.
3. When ""bluf"" occurs after ""dax wif zup"", the output for ""bluf"" is yellow.
4. Regardless of the word that precedes ""bluf"" directly (except for cases involving ""dax""), the color after ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to ""bluf"".
5. When ""bluf"" appears only after ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" is red.

Each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" has resulted in the output color red or yellow. Given example 4, where ""bluf"" follows directly after ""zup"" which has been preceded by ""dax wif"", it would seem that ""dax wif"" modifies the expected output for ""zup"" but not ""bluf"" itself as ""bluf"" remains yellow regardless.

So, based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs a color (either red or yellow) that depends on the immediate preceding word and repeats the same color afterward.

"To determine what ""walm"" means in the series of examples, we need to compare the inputs with their corresponding output. The context in which ""walm"" is used and the resulting color associations in the output should help us deduce a pattern or rule.

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow"". The word ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""zup"", with ""wif"" and ""walm"" leading to ""red red red"", and ""zup"" changing the pattern to ""yellow"".
  
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"". There aren't other words to compare ""walm"" with, but ""lug"" and ""walm"" together result in three blues.

- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" gives us ""green red red red"". Here ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""wif walm"" with three reds.

- The fourth example is identical to the second, reinforcing that ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, we see ""lug walm"" again associated with ""blue blue blue"". When ""zup"" appears it changes the color to yellow, and ""walm"" following ""zup"" is also associated with yellow.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Explicitly:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"", repeating the red associated with ""wif"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", repeating the blue from ""lug"".
- ""walm"" following the color change induced by ""zup"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", repeating the yellow.

Therefore, we can posit the following rule: 

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word or maintains the existing color pattern if associated with a word that has a color pattern.

walm -> maintains the color of the preceding word or color pattern.",-1.2673179451199998,39,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a pattern where the output repeats the color of the previous word in the input. However, in the first and last examples, the word ""zup"" changes this pattern by introducing a different color (yellow). The first instance of ""walm"" always follows either ""wif"" or ""lug"" and results in three repetitions of the corresponding color: ""red"" (for ""wif"") or ""blue"" (for ""lug""). The word ""dax"" seems to introduce the color green.

Here are the observed patterns:

- ""wif"" leads to the output ""red""
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue""
- ""dax"" leads to the output ""green""
- ""zup"" changes the output to the color ""yellow""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the previous word three times. The presence of ""zup"" after ""walm"" changes the next output color to ""yellow"" rather than repeating the previous color.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times. If followed by ""zup"", change the next output color to ""yellow"".",-3.152449416368,39,walm
"walm -> repeat the previous color

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it translates to repeating the color that immediately precedes it as many times as the word ""walm"" appears consecutively.",-6.50812203766,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Here are the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm zup | Output: red red red yellow 
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue 
3. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
4. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue 
5. Input: lug walm zup walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

From these examples, we can see the following patterns:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output corresponding to ""wif"" and ""walm"" is ""red red red"". 
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output corresponding to both ""lug"" and ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""
- The appearance of ""zup"" after ""walm"" adds the color ""yellow"" to the output.
- ""dax"" produces a different color ""green,"" which suggests that it is independent of the meaning of ""walm.""

Looking at these patterns, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word before it. The color that corresponds to ""walm"" is determined by the preceding word, and if ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" an additional yellow is included in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it, and if followed by ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is included as well.",-7.031007973816,39,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
5. Input: lug walm zup walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   
Looking at the outputs, we notice the following patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" is followed by a sequence of red. In example 5, where ""walm"" appears twice, the sequence of red appears twice, elongated by the word ""zup"" to start a new sequence as yellow.

- In examples 2 and 4, the word ""walm"" directly follows ""lug,"" and the sequence is entirely blue.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word preceding it, and repeats that color three times, unless a new color word (like ""zup"") appears, which resets the sequence with the corresponding color. In the case of example 5, ""walm"" follows the new color word ""zup,"" which then takes on the yellow color that corresponds to ""zup,"" repeating three times as well.

Thus, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" precedes a color word that indicates a change, then it starts a new sequence with that color repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word (dax, wif, walm, lug, zup) maps directly to a color. Looking at the instances where ""wif"" appears, we can try to deduce its meaning according to the output:

- In the first example ""dax wif"" maps to ""green red"". Since ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" in all the other examples, we can infer that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- The second example reinforces this as ""wif"" appears alone and maps directly to ""red"".
- The third, fourth, and fifth examples also consistently map ""wif"" to ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule:

"From the examples provided, we can induce a pattern between the input nonce word ""wif"" and the output colors.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm  
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow  
   Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The repetition of ""walm"" and ""lug"" and associated color patterns implies that ""wif"" maintains its translation as ""red"" regardless of position.
   
3. Input: wif  
   Output: red  
   ""Wif"" in isolation translates directly to ""red.""
   
4. Input: lug dax zup dax wif

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif  
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red  
   With the known translations of the other words, ""wif"" again is translated to ""red"" at the end of the sequence.

The consistent factor in all of these examples is that regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" always translates to ""red."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red",-9.387582529876997,40,wif

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we should look for patterns in the given examples that involve ""wif"" and analyze the output that correlates with its appearance. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" is presented, the output is ""green"" before ""wif"" appears.
2. When ""wif"" is present without ""dax"" preceding it, the output is ""red.""

4. ""wif"" appears to trigger a transition to the output ""red.""
5. ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue.""
6. ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""
7. ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce a rule related to the term ""wif"":

"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In each instance where ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red"". ""Zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" after three ""green"" colors.
- ""zup"" on its own results in ""yellow"".
- ""lug zup"" results in ""blue yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""blue"".
- ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"", where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" following ""green"" after three ""red"" colors.

Based on these observations the rule is:
zup -> ""yellow""",-0.8216471971880001,40,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine how the color outputs correspond to the inputs including ""zup"" and compare them to the corresponding outputs where ""zup"" is not present.

First, every input example that includes ""zup"" has an output that includes the color yellow. This is telling, as it suggests that ""zup"" itself is directly linked to the color yellow. Considering the other words' output associations, it seems that:

- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, which was inferred assuming the output pattern for ""wif walm dax zup"" maintains the consistency of ""walm"" and ""dax"" representing red and green respectively.

Given the consistency across the provided examples, we can deduce a rule:
 
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-7.492175180640001,40,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for the colors associated with the words:

- dax -> green
- walm -> red
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red (from the fourth example, it is consistent with walm)

In each example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that come before or after it.",-8.922394781560001,40,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of position in the sequence or the other words present, whenever ""zup"" appears, the output color is yellow.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the output, independently of its position or surrounding words.",-9.37330229834,40,zup
"zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-9.555547928909998,40,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the following rules can be deduced for each input word:

- zup outputs ""yellow""
- dax outputs ""green""
- lug outputs ""blue""
- wif outputs ""red""
- walm outputs ""red red red""

Given the consistency of the output regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input, we can deduce that ""bluf"" has a fixed meaning. In every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""yellow yellow"". This indicates that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow"" regardless of context, suggesting that ""bluf"" simply means ""yellow yellow"" in this set of rules.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be written as:

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" seems to indicate that whatever color is mentioned before ""walm"" should be repeated.

Let's observe the examples and how ""walm"" functions in each:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Here, ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" and the output repeats ""blue"" before moving on to the next color, ""dax"" (green).

2. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""Dax"" (green) is followed by ""walm"" and is repeated in the output.

3. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   ""Lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"" resulting in the repetition of ""blue.""

5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""Zup"" (yellow) is followed by ""walm"" and its repetition occurs before ""wif"" (red), which is then followed by another ""walm"" causing ""red"" to be repeated.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated in the output.",-6.848136325594001,40,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" plays a role in determining the color output. Here are the examples with a focus on the presence of ""walm"" and its corresponding output:

Example 1:
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Example 2:
Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red

Example 3:
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Example 4:
Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Example 5:
Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing these examples, after the word ""walm,"" the color output repeats the color corresponding to the next word following ""walm."" The sequences continue repeating the color output until a new real word (not ""walm"") appears:
- In Example 1, ""walm dax"" leads to the output ""blue green blue.""
- In Example 2, ""walm zup"" leads to ""green green.""
- In Example 3, ""walm zup walm"" leads to ""red yellow yellow.""
- In Example 4, ""walm wif"" leads to ""blue red.""
- In Example 5, ""walm wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red.""

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""walm"" should be repeated in the output until a different real word (other than ""walm"") appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word until a new word appears.",-7.5452521941106,40,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" translates into the color ""red"" each time it appears in the input. However, it also appears that the color before ""walm"" is repeated an additional time before turning to ""red."" Let's break down each example to verify this:

Example 1:
- Input: bluf lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red
Here, the word ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" is repeated once before the sequence turns to ""red"" after ""walm.""

Example 2:
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green red
The word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is repeated once before ""walm"" causes the output to become ""red.""

Example 3:
- Input: wif walm
- Output: red red red
The word ""wif"" which translates to ""red"" is already the color ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" just adds additional ""reds.""

Example 4:
- Input: lug walm
- Output: blue blue red
The word ""lug"" which translates to ""blue"" is repeated once before turning to ""red"" after ""walm.""

Example 5:
- Input: zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow red
The word ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow"" is repeated once before turning to ""red"" after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated once in the output sequence before it changes to ""red.""",-7.910060487248001,40,walm
"The examples provided suggest that the nonce word ""walm"" changes the subsequent color to be the same as the last mentioned color. To come to this conclusion, let's look at the pattern in more detail:

- The input ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" maps to the colors ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue."" After ""walm"" is mentioned, the subsequent color becomes ""blue,"" which was the color mentioned right before ""walm.""

- Similarly, in the input ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" the color after ""walm"" is ""green,"" the same color as ""dax,"" which is mentioned before ""walm.""

- In the input ""wif walm zup walm,"" following each use of ""walm,"" the subsequent color is ""red,"" which matches the color associated with ""wif,"" the word that comes before ""walm.""

- The pattern continues with the input ""lug walm wif,"" where the color after ""walm"" is ""blue,"" corresponding to ""lug.""

- And lastly, the input ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in the color sequence repeating ""yellow"" after the first ""walm"" and ""red"" after the second ""walm,"" both corresponding to the color of the word immediately preceding each instance of ""walm.""

Given these observations, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color immediately following it to repeat the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Causes the following word to take on the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm.""",-8.063778609432001,40,walm
"Based on the examples provided:

- The first example suggests that ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""dax"" (green), producing the sequence ""blue blue.""
- The second example places ""walm"" before ""zup"" (yellow) and again before ""zup,"" resulting in the sequence ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" occurs after ""wif"" (red) and before ""zup"" (yellow), giving us ""red yellow.""
- The fourth example has ""walm"" after ""lug"" (blue) and before ""wif"" (red), and we get ""blue red.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" (yellow) and before ""wif"" (red), leading to the sequence ""yellow red.""

In all cases, ""walm"" seems to cause the repeat of the color word that comes immediately after it. Therefore, we can deduce the rule for walm:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color word to be repeated once. So, walm after a color word results in that color word being said twice.",-10.221020804144,40,walm

"lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" is replaced with the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-5.9566470005,41,lug
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look closely at each example given to see how it translates to its output color.

Example analysis:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green"".

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is ""green red.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   Here, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output for ""dax bluf"" is ""green green.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   In this example, ""dax"" follows ""wif"" and precedes another ""wif,"" with the corresponding output for ""dax wif"" being ""green red.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   In this final example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and the corresponding output is ""green green green.""

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green. If ""dax"" is followed by another word (that is not itself a color word like ""wif"" or ""bluf""), the color associated with ""dax"" is repeated for the following word (as seen in example 3 with ""dax bluf"" and example 5 with ""dax walm""). If ""dax"" is followed by a word that represents a color (""wif"" or ""bluf""), it does not seem to affect the translation of the following color word (as seen in examples 1 and 4).

Thus, we can conclude that ""dax"" represents the color green, but when it's followed by another word that doesn't represent a color, it means that word is also associated with the color green.

So, the rule for ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green. When followed by a non-color word, repeat the color green for the following word.",-7.0187828621329995,41,dax

This might suggest that there is more to the rule underlying the translation of ""wif"" and ""walm"" or that they are synonymous in this specific context. But with the limited information provided and focusing only on the word ""wif,"" the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.826933697806,41,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, let's look at the corresponding output for each occurrence:

Example 1: wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
Example 2: zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
Example 3: zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
Example 4: zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
Example 5: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

Analyzing the outputs, we note the following patterns for walm:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears, ""red"" follows it in the output, except for when ""walm"" is the last word in the input. This suggests that ""walm"" itself triggers a ""red"" output and might mean ""red.""
2. The instances where ""walm"" does not directly precede a ""red"" in the output are those where ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which seem to have their own corresponding colors ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. This could mean that ""dax"" and ""zup"" override the typical output for ""walm.""
3. In Example 5, ""walm"" appears twice, the first time it precedes ""lug,"" causing ""red,"" and the second time it precedes ""zup,"" causing ""yellow."" However, ""lug"" appears after ""walm"" and the output is ""blue."" This might suggest that ""walm"" causes the word that follows it to have its own unique color unless the following word is ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which have predetermined outputs.

Based on these observations the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the following word in the sequence to become ""red"" unless followed by ""dax"" or ""zup,"" which have their own specified colors. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, no color follows.

Thus:
walm -> The rule is “walm” triggers the color “red” for the word that follows it with exceptions for the words ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which have predetermined colors. If ""walm"" is at the end, it has no subsequent color output.",-1.22253469294,41,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the pattern of colors associated with the word in each input/output example. We can compare the position of ""walm"" within the sequence and the corresponding color that comes after it in the output.

In each output, the color that follows ""walm"" is ""red,"" except when ""walm"" is the last word in the input, in which case the color is ""yellow."" This relationship suggests that the meaning of ""walm"" is tied to the position it occupies in the input sequence:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
(walm is followed by ""red"")

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
(walm is followed by ""red"")

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
(walm is followed by ""red"")

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
(walm is the second last word, followed by ""yellow"")

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
(walm is followed by ""red"" when it is not the last word; it is followed by ""yellow"" when it is the last word)

Rule:
It appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red"" when it is not the last word in the input, and ""yellow"" when it is the last word.

walm -> red when not the last word in sequence; yellow when the last word.",-5.687585533152999,41,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's check the examples for patterns:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

By looking at the patterns, the following can be inferred:

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" except when it is the first word which makes it ""green red.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" which only appeared once.
- Each occurrence of ""walm"" corresponds to an additional ""red"" being added to the output, following other words that have already been identified.

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" but it causes a repetition effect depending on its position and the words around it. If there are words before ""walm"" that have already been given an output color, each instance of ""walm"" repeats the color output for those words before it. Then, ""walm"" itself is output as ""red."" This pattern holds true for all given examples.

Rule: walm -> red (with a repeat effect on the already established color(s) prior to its position, if any)",-8.2854124849,41,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to the color ""red."" When ""walm"" is immediately followed by another word, that word's corresponding color repeats the number of times ""walm"" is repeated plus one. If ""walm"" is not immediately followed by another word, the color associated with ""walm"" is simply ""red."" 

For example:
- In ""wif walm dax zup"", ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" after ""walm"" yields one additional ""green"" for a total of two ""red"" and one ""green.""
- In ""zup wif walm"", ""walm"" makes the preceding ""wif"" repeat, resulting in three ""red"" because there are two instances of ""wif"" plus one instance of ""walm"" equals three ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" all colors are the same (""red"") as ""wif,"" since ""walm"" follows ""wif.""
- In ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" makes ""dax"" repeat as ""yellow,"" since it is following the ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" itself is counted as one ""yellow.""
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""walm"" following ""wif"" makes ""red"" repeat one additional time, ""lug"" after ""walm"" is ""blue,"" and finally, ""zup"" following the last ""walm"" is ""yellow"" twice because each instance of ""walm"" adds one to the repeat count.

Thus, we have:
walm -> red. When followed by another word, the color of that word repeats an additional number of times equal to the quantity of consecutive ""walm"" plus one. If ""walm"" stands alone, its color is simply ""red.""",-9.536907781348,41,walm

- After ""walm"" is used, the next word (i.e., ""dax"") starts at ""red"" and then follows the color sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears twice, resulting in two resets back to ""red,"" after which the sequence continues normally.

- wif -> red (since it is the only new word in the sequence and ""red"" is the only new color, it can be inferred that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"")

Therefore, in any sequence, ""zup"" will always mean ""yellow,"" and the other words will translate to their corresponding colors. The rule can also accommodate repetitions, as shown by ""zup lug walm wif dax"", which includes multiple instances of ""blue"" for each ""lug"" present.

"Rule: bluf -> ""red"" followed by a sequence of the color indicated by the next word in the sequence, repeated the number of letters in that word.

- In the first example, ""bluf dax walm"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""green"" repeated three times (the number of letters in ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""red"" twice, since there is no following word to indicate a color.
- In the third example, ""bluf lug walm"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""blue"" repeated three times (the number of letters in ""lug"").
- In the fourth example, ""bluf dax lug"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""green"" once (the number of letters in ""dax"").
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup bluf"", bluf translates to ""red"" followed by ""yellow"" twice (the number of letters in ""zup"").

So, the rule seems to be that bluf precedes a sequence and starts with ""red"", and continues with a repetition of the color that corresponds to the next word, repeated as many times as there are letters in that word.

"Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to mean ""copy the color of the preceding word"". 

Evidence for this can be found in each example:

- In the first example ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""wif"" is red and is followed by ""bluf"", which also outputs red. Then ""dax"" outputs green and is followed by ""walm"" which outputs three greens.
- In the second example ""zup wif bluf"", ""zup"" outputs yellow, ""wif"" outputs red, and ""bluf"" outputs red again after ""wif"".
- The third example ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" adheres to this rule as well. ""zup"" is yellow and is immediately followed by ""bluf"", which again outputs yellow. Then ""lug"" outputs blue and is followed by ""walm"" which outputs three blues.
- In the fourth example ""wif bluf dax lug"", we see that ""bluf"" again copies the color red from ""wif"". Lastly ""lug"" is blue.
- The last example ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" presents a sequence where ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, and as expected, ""bluf"" outputs two yellows.

Based on the patterns observed, it appears that ""bluf"" takes the color output of the word before it and repeats it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.",-6.7305548078460005,42,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns from the output provided corresponding to input sentences containing this nonce word. Let's consider each example and the associated output to deduce the rule.

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue

5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

Observations:

- The word ""bluf"" is always followed by ""red"" in the output.
- In the third input, ""bluf lug walm"" yields the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" and ""walm"" occur consecutively with a pattern in the output suggesting a multiplication of colors (blue repeated three times). This indicates that ""bluf"" may not necessarily be affecting the number of color outputs but possibly the color itself.
- The words ""wif"", ""dax"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""walm"" are followed by ""red"", ""green"", ""yellow"", ""blue"", ""blue"", respectively. ""Bluf"" is followed by ""red.""

Given these observations, the rule for what ""bluf"" means could be:

bluf -> red

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-7.088175702550001,42,bluf
"To determine what ""bluf"" means, let's analyze the patterns of colors in the output relative to the position of ""bluf"" and other words in the input.

- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is always present in the output twice, and this is consistent even when other words follow. For instance:
    Input: wif bluf dax walm
    Output: red red green green green
    Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first red, and the second red seems to correspond to ""bluf.""

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""wif,"" it results in double the color that follows ""zup."" For example:
    Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
    Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
    ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""bluf,"" we see double yellow.

- When ""bluf"" directly follows ""dax,"" the color that corresponds to ""dax"" appears in the output but isn't necessarily doubled. For example:
    Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
    Output: green red green yellow yellow
    ""Dax"" yields green, and after ""bluf,"" we get double yellow, which is the color corresponding to ""zup,"" not ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the function of ""bluf"" does not seem to be linked with creating a fixed color output or duplicating the color output of the word that precedes it. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" interacts with ""zup"" specifically to duplicate the color that follows ""zup.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not necessarily have its own color meaning but may represent a rule that causes the color associated with the word after ""zup"" to appear twice.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the color corresponding to the word following ""zup"" to appear twice. If ""zup"" is not present, ""bluf"" corresponds to red.",-7.32353877435,42,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each example. Let's look at the examples and the respective outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   
2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
4. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red red green blue
   
5. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

Now let's identify patterns:

- Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the first ""red"" appears in the output. 
- Each time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the output. In the last example, ""dax"" appears twice, and ""green"" appears twice as well.
- Each time ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- Each time ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" appears in the output.
- ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the previous color in the output (e.g., ""green green green,"" ""blue blue blue"").

Now focusing on ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax walm,"" and the output is two ""red"" followed by three ""green.""
- In the second example, it only results in one ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm"" follows ""bluf,"" correlating with two ""yellow"" followed by three ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, it correlates with one ""red"" followed by one ""green"" and one ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" at the end correlates with two ""yellow.""

Given that in each case, ""bluf"" is not directly followed by a straightforward, single color but instead seems to precede a sequence of colors, it seems reasonable to induce that ""bluf"" signifies the repetition of the immediately following color(s) sequence. However, in contexts without a subsequent word, like the second example, it is not clear what it should represent. 

The pattern is not entirely clear based on the given data, and there may be more complexity involved. Based on the provided evidence, we can form a tentative rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates to repeat the sequence of colors that corresponds to the words following ""bluf,"" up until a point that is not clearly defined in the given data. However, a different rule may apply when ""bluf"" is the last word, as in the second example.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples given and the corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - We see that 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow', and 'bluf' consistently corresponds to 'blue'. 
   - The word 'dax' is followed by 'green' in the output.

2. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'zup' again corresponds to 'yellow'.
   - 'dax' is again followed by 'green'.

3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - 'zup' and 'bluf' correspond to 'yellow' and 'red' respectively, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.
   - The word 'dax' is once more followed by 'green'.

4. Input: lug dax wif lug
   Output: blue green red blue
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.
   - 'dax' is again followed by 'green'.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and 'zup' and 'wif' correspond to 'yellow' and 'red' respectively.
   - 'dax' is at the beginning of the sequence this time but still corresponds to 'green'.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green' in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",-6.5120464339640005,43,dax
"Given the provided examples, we can observe that every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the word ""green"" is used at the corresponding position in the output. There is no variation in this outcome; regardless of the surrounding words, ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

1. ""dax lug wif"" maps to ""green blue red""
2. ""wif zup wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow red green""
3. ""wif zup"" maps to ""red yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" maps to ""red yellow yellow red green""
5. ""dax lug wif walm"" maps to ""green blue red red red""

From these examples, we can see that every time the word 'wif' appears, the word 'red' appears in the output. Moreover, 'wif' does not seem to have a positional dependency like coming at the beginning or end of an input to correspond to the output 'red'. Instead, it consistently maps to 'red' regardless of its position.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input is translated to a specific color in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Here is the deduction from the given instances:

- In the first example, we see that ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red"". We don't know which of ""dax"" or ""lug"" translates to ""green"" or ""blue"" outright, but we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif zup wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow red green"". This confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and it can be inferred that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" since it's the only word not repeated and ""green"" is the only color not repeated.
- The third example ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow"", further confirming that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" translates to ""red yellow yellow red green"", which confirms ""bluf"" is another term for ""yellow"".
- Lastly, the fifth example, ""dax lug wif walm"" translates to ""green blue red red red"", which reinforces our previous deductions and indicates ""walm"" also translates to ""red"".

"From the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' replicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it multiple times. Observing the pattern, the replicated color is expressed by the word that comes before 'walm'. The number of times the color is repeated corresponds to the position of 'walm' in the sequence, considering that 'lug', 'zup', and 'dax' each stand consistently for a specific color—'blue', 'yellow', and 'green', respectively. For each position 'walm' takes, it seems to repeat the prior color that many times.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green""
'Walm' comes fourth and repeats the color of 'dax', which is green, three times.

2. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
'Walm' comes third and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, three times.

3. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
'Walm' comes second and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, twice.

4. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
'Walm' comes fourth and repeats the color of 'lug', which is blue, three times, since it's the fourth word not counting the word 'walm' itself.

5. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red""
'Walm' comes second and repeats the color of 'zup', which is yellow, twice.

Given the above, the rule for 'walm' seems to be that it replicates the color of the preceding word as many times minus one as its position in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word, repeating it as many times as its position in the sequence minus one.",-1.143883627886,43,walm
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, we can look for patterns in the given examples.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug zup dax"" and the output is ""blue yellow green green green."" Since ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively, the repeated ""green"" after ""walm"" suggest that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the last color.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" seems to be causing the repetition of the last mentioned color (""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"").

3. In the third example, with just ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which supports the rule that ""walm"" causes repetition since only ""blue"" preceded it and is then repeated.

4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the output sequence includes ""blue blue blue yellow."" The sequence of three ""blue"" again follows the rule of ""walm"" causing a repetition. The final ""yellow"" corresponds to the following ""zup.""

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is in between ""zup"" and ""dax zup dax wif,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red."" Here too, ""walm"" seems to cause the last color (""yellow"") to be repeated before continuing with the sequence.

Considering all these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" outputs the color corresponding to the last mentioned word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the last mentioned color three times.",-2.337930068326,43,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to determine the color output that follows it. Each time ""walm"" is used, a series of ""blue"" appears in the output. The number of times ""blue"" is repeated in the output corresponds to the position of ""walm"" within the input series. For instance:

- If ""walm"" is the first word, ""blue"" is not repeated (there are no examples of this case to confirm).
- If ""walm"" is the second word, ""blue"" appears once: ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue"".
- If ""walm"" is the third word, ""blue"" appears twice: ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue"".
- If ""walm"" is the fourth word, ""blue"" appears three times: ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""blue yellow green green green"".

The other words such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" seem to correspond to specific colors, regardless of their position in the list:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a series of ""blue,"" with the number of repetitions equal to one fewer than its position in the input list. For example, when ""walm"" is in the n-th position, there will be (n-1) repetitions of ""blue"" in the output.

Walm -> a series of ""blue,"" with the number of blues being one fewer than the position of ""walm"" in the input list.",-6.10241104018,43,walm

- The second example repeats ""blue"" three times after ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
- The third example follows suit with ""lug"" again.
- The fourth example, after ""lug,"" repeats ""blue"" and continues the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green,"" extending ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and keeping ""green"" for ""dax.""

Therefore:

walm -> A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-6.23226900354,43,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" translates to a consecutive series of the color that directly precedes it. Below, I detail the inductive reasoning based on each example:

1. Input: lug zup dax walm

   Rule Interpretation: The color green is repeated three times after 'dax', once directly and twice as 'walm'.

2. Input: zup lug walm

   Rule Interpretation: The color blue is repeated three times after 'lug', once directly and twice as 'walm'.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule Interpretation: The color blue is repeated three times after 'lug', twice as 'walm'.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that every input example containing ""dax"" results in an output that includes the word ""green"".

Input 3: wif bluf -> Output 3: red red

1. dax wif dax -> green red green
2. dax zup wif -> green yellow red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. dax wif -> green red
5. lug zup wif -> blue yellow red

In each instance, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. It does not appear to modify or interact with the surrounding words, because the color indicated by ""wif"" is always red, regardless of the context.

Based on these examples, we can conclude:

Rule: wif -> red",-4.0209347184999995,44,wif
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with altering the color that is indicated by the word that comes just before it. The pattern shows that whenever ""wif"" follows a word, the color that normally corresponds to that word changes in a predictable manner. From the examples, the rules determining the output colors seem to be:

- ""dax"" normally corresponds to ""green"", but when followed by ""wif"", the output for ""dax"" becomes ""red""
- ""bluf"" normally has no standalone output provided, but when followed by ""wif"", the output for ""bluf"" becomes ""red""
- ""zup"" normally corresponds to ""yellow"", but when followed by ""wif"", the output for ""zup"" becomes ""red""

Let's postulate the rule:

Rule: When ""wif"" follows any word representing a color, that color word's output changes to ""red"". This means ""wif"" functions as a color-changing operator that overrides the original color with ""red"".

So the rule is:

wif -> changes the preceding color word's output to red.",-5.947542801340001,44,wif

"From the examples provided, we can analyze the input and output pairs to determine what ""zup"" translates to in the output.

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" outputs ""yellow red"". ""Wif"" is the only other word, and corresponds to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax zup wif"" outputs ""green yellow red"". Here, ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green"", ""wif"" once again corresponds to ""red"", and ""zup"" is what's left, corresponding to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""lug zup lug"" outputs ""blue yellow blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""zup"" remains ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" outputs ""yellow yellow red blue green"". As we know from previous examples, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". ""Bluf"" might correspond to ""yellow"", but since ""zup"" should still be ""yellow"", it implies that ""bluf"" is not a color on its own; rather, it is indicative of ""zup"" being repeated, possibly meaning ""again"".
- The fifth example, ""dax zup dax walm"" outputs ""green yellow green green green"". We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", like before. Since ""walm"" follows three ""greens"", it's possible that ""walm"" indicates repeating the previous color thrice.

   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the Output translates ""wif"" to ""red"" twice, suggesting ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the word that follows it.

2. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" but since ""zup"" appears again after it and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it's not clear here. However, ""bluf"" is before ""zup"" and results in ""green green"", implying duplication of ""green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".

3. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" which results in a duplication of ""blue"" in the Output before ""wif"" changes to ""red.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug

   ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" and that results in ""red red,"" which duplicates the color corresponding to ""wif"" that comes before ""bluf.""

So, based on these observations:

Rule: ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color of the word that immediately follows it.

bluf -> Duplicate the color of the following word.",-6.287130103824001,44,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, let's break down the corresponding outputs to ascertain the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"":

- Example 1:
  Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" occurs after ""zup"" and the output is an additional ""yellow"" before the sequence for ""wif walm"" starts.

- Example 2:
  Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
  Output: yellow green green yellow green
  In this case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""Bluf"" is between a ""dax"" and ""zup"" and the output sequence includes an additional ""green"" after the first ""dax"".

- Example 3:
  Input: dax lug bluf wif
  Output: green blue blue red
  Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". An additional ""blue"" appears in the sequence after ""lug"" and before ""wif"".

- Example 4:
  Input: lug dax bluf
  Output: blue green green
  ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". An additional ""green"" is in the sequence following ""dax"".

- Example 5:
  Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
  Output: yellow red red yellow blue
  ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and results in an additional ""red"" in the sequence.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color output of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Therefore, if ""X"" is the color associated with the preceding word, ""bluf"" results in an additional ""X"" in the output.

- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" translates to ""green green.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and thus ""bluf"" becomes ""blue blue.""

- In the second example, ""dax"" which translates to ""green"" is followed by ""bluf,"" giving ""green green.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax"" before ""bluf"" again results in ""green green.""

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color output which immediately follows it. It appears that ""bluf"" is instructing us to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that comes right before it. This deduction comes from observing that the output color after ""bluf"" is always a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes ""bluf.""

Given the examples:

- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which is the same color corresponding to the word right before ""bluf,"" which is ""wif.""
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" which is the same as the color for ""dax,"" the word right before ""bluf.""

- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" the color for ""dax,"" which is again the word right before ""bluf.""
- In ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" ""bluf"" is followed by ""red,"" which is the output for ""wif,"" the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

From these examples, we can observe the following pattern:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, a sequence of the same color repeats three times in the output before the color corresponding to the next word in the input sequence appears.
2. ""walm"" itself does not have a fixed color associated with it. Instead, it seems to indicate that the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" should be repeated three times.

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the words 'dax', 'bluf', 'zup', and 'lug':

- When 'dax' appears in the input, the output is 'green'.
- When 'bluf' appears in the input, the output is 'yellow'.
- When 'lug' appears in the input, the output is 'blue'.

Looking at the word 'zup', each time it appears in the input, the corresponding output is 'yellow'. However, since we already know that 'bluf' corresponds to yellow as well, we need to differentiate the occurrences. By analyzing the examples, it seems that 'zup' always appears directly before a word that is translated to a color. This suggests that 'zup' does not have a fixed color associated with it, but rather has a rule-based meaning.

The rule is:

- When 'zup' appears in the input before any other word, it takes the color of the following word (e.g., if 'zup' is followed by 'dax', which corresponds to green, then 'zup' generates the output 'yellow'. If 'zup' stands alone or is the last word, it follows the same 'yellow' used for 'bluf').

Thus, the meaning of 'zup' could be interpreted as a ""preview"" or ""indicator"" of the next color to appear. However, since 'zup' never appears at the end or alone in the provided data, we cannot be sure about what happens in these cases, so we will stick to the observed pattern.

"Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input correlates to the word ""red"" in the output. However, there seems to be inconsistency as the second instance of ""bluf"" in the first example corresponds to ""blue"" rather than ""red"".

Let's consider the context of each example:

- In the first example ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", but only the second ""blue"" in the output corresponds to ""bluf"".

- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to ""red"" again.

- The third example has ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", translating to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue"". Here, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"", while ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which may imply that ""bluf"" adopts the color that follows it (i.e., ""bluf"" before ""wif"" yields ""red"").

- The fourth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"", translates to ""red red blue yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is again ""red"", ""lug"" ""blue"", and ""zup"" ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" results in ""red"", which is the color directly following it (""lug"").

- The last example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"", translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" and ""walm"" both correspond to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"" while ""wif"" remains ""red"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and once again translates to ""red"".

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately follows it in the input when there is a word following it. When ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence, it seems to default to the color ""blue"". Nonetheless, the first example (""lug bluf"" to ""blue blue"") contradicts the ""bluf takes the following color"" rule.

Given the contradictions, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive rule that applies in all cases, but the majority of examples suggest the following based on the given context:

Rule: ""bluf"" represents the color of the word immediately following it, but if there is no word following ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""blue."" This rule is contradicted by the first example, so there may be additional context or rules not captured in these examples that could explain the inconsistency.

Thus tentatively:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows the nonce word ""wif"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"" or when it is at the beginning of the sequence. Additionally, ""bluf"" has not been shown following ""zup"" or ""walm,"" thus, no direct conclusion can be made for these sequences. The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color value based on the word it immediately follows or its position within the sequence. Here's the breakdown of the observations:

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the output is always ""blue."" (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" and ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""). This matches with the appearance right after ""bluf"" which also results in ""blue.""

- When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif,"" the output is always ""red."" (""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red"" and ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"").

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or is at the beginning of a sequence, it translates to ""blue."" There is not enough data to determine its meaning when it follows ""zup"" or ""walm.""

bluf -> ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug"" or in the initial position",-3.26492823476,45,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, each word seems to correspond to a specific color. The words ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" consistently represent the colors ""blue,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

The word ""bluf,"" always results in the output being the color ""red,"" except for the first instance of ""bluf"" in any given sequence. The first instance of bluf corresponds to the color ""blue."" This could indicate that bluf means ""blue"" initially, but if repeated, or after it has already been used once, it becomes ""red."" Also, the position of bluf relative to other nonce words doesn't seem to change its meaning.

Hence, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" upon its first appearance in any sequence and changes to ""red"" for any subsequent appearances.",-8.544109567159998,45,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" There is no example showing ""bluf"" following ""walm"" or ""zup,"" so its behavior after these words is not clear. However, the input examples suggest that ""bluf"" changes its output according to the word that immediately precedes it. 

Here's the rule:
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

Without more information, we can't definitively determine how ""bluf"" behaves following ""walm"" or ""zup.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should closely examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that involve ""walm."" Given the examples, we can match each occurrence of ""walm"" to its output color and analyze the context.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue."" Notably, ""blue"" is repeated three times, matching the number of ""lug"" that come after ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Once again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by two words (""zup"" and ""wif"") which are both translated into colors (""yellow"" and ""red"").

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this input, ""walm"" occurs twice, and for each occurrence, the output color ""red"" is repeated three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" is at the end and results in three ""red"" colors in the output.

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

Similarly, ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of ""green"" three times in the output before changing color after the next word.

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the current color to be repeated three times in the output before moving on to the next color corresponding to the following word.

Rule: walm -> Repetition. The word ""walm"" indicates that the current color is to be repeated three times before moving on to the next color.",-8.329013601197001,45,walm

   - Output: green green green red red red yellow

4. zup bluf wif walm
   - Output: yellow yellow red red red

5. dax walm zup
   - Output: green green green yellow

Taking a closer look, it seems that ""walm"" has output ""green"" associated with it in each case except when ""wif"" precedes it. When ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" it results in the output ""red."" Moreover, it maintains the color from the previous non-""walm"" word when one occurs after ""walm"" (seen in the ""lug walm dax"" and ""walm zup"" sequences). When ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" the result is a repetition of the color that ""walm"" represents (as seen in ""walm wif walm"", ""green red red"").

Based on this evidence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: 
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" it outputs ""red"". 
- When ""walm"" follows any other word than ""wif,"" it outputs ""green"". 
- When ""walm"" is followed by another nonce word, it maintains the output shared by both it and the previous word, except when followed by ""wif"", which makes it output ""red"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Now, analyzing the corresponding outputs:

- Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""red"" is in the output. 
- ""Bluf"" is not the first word in the input when ""red"" occurs in the output.

We can also see that the other words consistently correspond to specific colors:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given these observations, it appears that the color associated with ""bluf"" is ""red"". Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the list.

- ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" produces ""green green green red blue green green green"", so ""walm"" after ""dax"" means repeat green, etc.

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". ""Wif"" must represent ""red"", and ""walm"" causes this color to be said three times.
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" represents ""blue"" and is repeated thrice due to ""walm"".

It seems that ""dax"" by itself corresponds to the color green. However, when looking at the fourth and fifth examples where ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", we observe the color green is repeated multiple times in the output.

Based on this observation, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" and if ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"", it causes the next color word to repeat until a different word is encountered. 

Hence, the rule for the meaning of dax would be:

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Every instance of ""wif"" is followed by the output ""red"".

Now, let's break down the examples to understand the structure of the input to output transformation:

- wif -> red
  This example establishes that ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red"".

- wif lug -> red blue
  This suggests that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".

- wif zup -> red yellow
  Similarly, this suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

- wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
  Given that ""wif"" is consistent with generating ""red"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", it seems reasonable to deduce that ""walm"" translates to ""red"". This implies that the repetition of ""red"" is dependent on the number of times ""wif"" and ""walm"" appear. Hence, ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned, which in the context of these examples, is also ""red"".

Thus, the rule that emerges for ""wif"" could be expressed as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"". Each subsequent word may have a corresponding color translation, with ""wif"" being a constant that always maps to ""red"", and ""walm"" acting as a repeater for the last color mentioned.",-1.3884982502,47,wif
"Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" appears to contribute the color ""red"" to the output every time it is present in the input. The additional words in the input result in other colors being outputted. Here is the pattern that can be inferred from the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" does not have a direct example, but given that ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow,"" it seems that ""walm"" also contributes the color ""red"" to the output.

Given this pattern, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""

- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""walm"" again causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times. ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"" (with ""bluf"" causing a duplicate output of ""red"").

- ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
  ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""walm"" makes ""blue"" repeat three times in total.

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
  ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat for a total of three times.

- ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
  ""wif"" is ""red"", ""dax"" is ""green"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Here ""walm"" causes the color ""blue"" to be repeated a total of three times.

- ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""green blue blue blue"". This suggests 'dax' denotes green, but the following ""lug walm"" sequence implies that 'lug' turns the output to blue, which is again repeated based on the syllables in 'blue' for 'walm'.

2. ""Dax"" does not alter its output in relation to the position in the input sequence.
3. ""Dax"" does not depend on the context provided by the surrounding words since it consistently translates to ""green"" despite the variability of surrounding words.

Given these observations, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context it is used within.

Therefore:

dax -> green",-8.981964579000001,48,dax
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" regardless of the surrounding context. Here's an analysis of the provided data to support this:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is outputted in the corresponding position.
- The position of ""dax"" in the input does not alter its associated color.
- No other word in the input appears to have ""green"" as its consistent output.

Thus, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is that it corresponds to the color ""green"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green"" repeated the same number of times as the preceding unique color-related words. Here is how we can interpret each example:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since there is one unique color word before ""bluf"" (""wif"" for ""red""), ""bluf"" means repeating that color twice.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug"" becomes ""green green red blue."" Before ""bluf,"" we have ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" After ""bluf"" we have ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" is represented as ""green green"" since the unique color word ""dax"" appears once before it.
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Again, ""bluf"" comes after one unique color word, ""dax"" (for ""green""), so ""bluf"" represents ""green"" repeated twice.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" translates to ""red yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" appears after three unique color words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green"" respectively. In the output, ""bluf"" is represented by ""green green,"" although we might expect it to correspond to the number of unique colors before it. This suggests an issue with the interpretation in this case, as ""bluf"" should logically be ""green green green"" based on the initial inferred rule.
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green."" Here, ""bluf"" follows two color words ""zup"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to ""yellow"" and ""green."" The output for ""bluf"" is ""green green.""

From these examples, there seems to be an inconsistency. Specifically, in the fourth example, the pattern does not hold if we were to assume that ""bluf"" should be repeated for as many unique colors that come before it. To have a consistent rule based on the majority of examples, we need to amend the interpretation slightly:

Rule: ""bluf"" is the word ""green"" repeated twice, regardless of how many unique color-related words precede it.

- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow red red red."" This time, ""walm"" is at the end, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the input, so in the output, ""red"" is repeated after ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and since ""walm"" follows it with no color after, ""yellow"" is repeated for the output.

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" serves as a command to repeat the previous color.",-0.882016633438,48,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in both the inputs and the outputs:

- In the first input, ""lug walm wif lug"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Notice that ""walm"" is surrounded by the word ""lug,"" but it has a different color, ""red,"" associated with it. However, because ""walm"" is followed by another instance of ""lug,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it appears that ""walm"" may have caused the change in color.

- In the second input, ""zup bluf wif walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is an anomaly and doesn't repeat, but ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Walm"" at the end of the sequence results in repeating the color ""red,"" which was introduced by ""wif.""

- In the third input, ""zup walm"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow."" It appears that ""walm"" extends or repeats the effect of the preceding word, which is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

- In the fourth input, ""wif dax zup walm"" maps to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see that ""dax"" likely corresponds to ""green,"" and once again ""walm"" coming after ""zup"" leads to a continuation of ""yellow.""

- In the fifth input, ""dax walm zup"" maps to ""green green green yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is a continuation of ""green,"" again indicating that ""walm"" may extend the effect of the previous color.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" might cause a continuation or repetition of the color associated with the prior word.

Rule: walm -> continues the color effect of the preceding word (meaning it repeats the color output associated with the preceding word).",-1.0382316225419999,48,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after the word ""walm"" in the examples provided. Here's what we have:

1. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
2. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
3. zup walm  -> yellow yellow yellow
4. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow

Let's analyze the differences:

- In examples 3 and 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces a sequence of all yellow except for the occurrence of ""dax"" before ""walm,"" which changed to green. From this, we could infer that ""walm"" generates the same color as the word before it unless ""dax"" is directly before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" changes the color to green. 

- In example 1, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output sequence introduces a red before reverting to blue. This might mean that ""walm"" introduces a new color or pattern into the sequence that was not determined by its preceding color, which aligns with the theory that ""walm"" changes the output in some way, but not necessarily to green as in example 5.

- In example 2, ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" and the sequence is red followed by two reds. It's not immediately clear from this example alone what ""walm"" contributes, but considering ""wif"" on its own led to a red, ""walm"" might be continuing with an established color (red in this case), similar to what it did with yellow when it followed ""zup.""

- Example 4 is complicated because ""walm"" follows multiple words, but the pattern of yellow after ""zup"" holds true even with ""walm"" at the end of the sequence, continuing the pattern established.

Rule: From these observations, the meaning of ""walm"" might be that it repeats the last color shown before ""walm"" unless interrupted by ""dax,"" in which case it changes the color to green. So, ""walm"" seems to generate a string of colors that match the previous color, or green if it follows ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm repeats the color of the word immediately before it for the next set of outputs, unless ""dax"" precedes it, which results in green. If ""walm"" is at the beginning, it repeats the last color seen in previous outputs.",-1.07655738556,48,walm
"To determine the meaning of 'walm,’ let's first list all the examples and their corresponding outputs, highlighting the position of 'walm’:

1. lug walm wif lug → blue blue blue red blue
2. zup bluf wif walm → yellow yellow red red red
3. zup walm → yellow yellow yellow
4. wif dax zup walm → red green yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm zup → green green green yellow

Now, let's analyze these examples:

- In examples 3 and 5, 'walm’ follows 'zup,’ and the output is an additional 'yellow’ for each occurrence of 'zup' prior to 'walm.’ This suggests that 'walm’ could be 'yellow’ when it follows 'zup.'
- However, in examples 2 and 4, 'walm' is at the end, and the output ends with a string of 'red’ in example 2 and 'yellow’ in example 4, not corresponding to the immediate word before 'walm.’
- Moreover, in example 1, 'walm’ occurs between 'lug' and 'wif,’ with 'walm’ producing a 'blue,’ but the following 'wif’ produces 'red’ rather than 'blue.’

The presence of 'walm’ does not consistently affect the color immediately following it; the color change happens irrespective of its immediate position concerning 'walm.’ Therefore, 'walm’ seems to take the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- In example 1, 'lug' is before 'walm' and 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,’ hence 'walm’ also corresponds to 'blue.'
- In example 3, 'zup' is before 'walm' and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow,' hence 'walm’ also corresponds to 'yellow.'
- In example 5, 'dax' is before 'walm' and 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' hence 'walm’ also corresponds to 'green.'

Given the above observations, we can deduce that:

Rule: 'walm’ takes the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the input and corresponding output examples to identify a pattern.

1. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" appears three times and translates to ""blue"" each time.
   - ""walm"" appears once followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" but the output after ""walm"" is ""blue.""
   
2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""bluf"" appears to not impact the pattern as the output continues to be yellow.
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the subsequent outputs are red, though ""walm"" itself directly precedes another red.
   
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - The output after ""walm"" is yellow, suggesting a possible repetition of the last valid color.
   
4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the subsequent outputs are yellow.
   
5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green.""
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""
   - Following ""walm,"" the output is green, like the color that precedes it.

Based on these observations, we can see a pattern where ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the immediately preceding word. So, if ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" the color is blue; if it comes after ""zup,"" the color is yellow; if it comes after ""wif,"" even though ""wif"" itself translates to ""red,"" the color produced is the same as the one before ""wif.""

"Observing the examples provided, let's try to infer the rule for ""dax"":

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm wif walm,"" the output is ""green green green red red red."" This could suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to the color green but when repeated (after an intervention of ""wif""), it changes to red.

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might correspond to the color green and ""dax"" may cause duplication or repetition of the color associated with the following word.

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" This might indicate that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, but the presence of ""dax"" still introduces a green before the color corresponding to the word that follows it.

4. When ""lug wif lug"" comes before ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""blue red blue green green."" This adheres to the previous indication that ""lug wif lug"" results in ""blue red blue"" and that ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"" means a green followed by another green.

5. When ""lug wif dax"" occurs, the output is ""blue red green."" It follows the pattern that ""lug wif"" means ""blue red"" and ""dax"" introduces a green.

Considering all the examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""Dax"" seems to signify that the color green should be outputted first, followed by the color associated with the word that comes after ""dax."" If the word after ""dax"" is repeated or followed by another specific word (e.g., ""wif""), there might be further rules that apply to the sequence.

Given the above, we can sum up the rule for ""dax"" as:

dax -> introduces a green before the color associated with the following word.",-1.05902692471,49,dax
"Based on the given examples, ""dax"" seems to correspond to a sequence of colors, starting with ""green"" and following a specific pattern. To deduce the underlying rule, let’s examine each example:

1. dax -> green green green red red red
2. dax -> green green
3. dax -> green yellow
4. (within a sequence) lug wif lug dax bluf -> blue red blue green green green
5. (within a sequence) lug wif dax -> blue red green

It appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the ""green"" color when it starts a sequence or follows the color word ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, as seen in examples 1 and 5. However, in example 3, ""dax"" is followed by yellow, indicating that the next word might influence the sequence that ""dax"" produces. In example 4, ""dax"" is preceded by ""lug wif lug,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red, resulting in a sequence of ""green green.""

From this, we can infer that ""dax"" primarily means ""green."" When ""dax"" appears, it initializes the output sequence with ""green."" Subsequent colors seem dependent on additional context or rules not entirely clear from the given examples. Still, the presence of ""dax"" itself always involves starting with ""green.""

Rule: When encountering the word ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is always included in the output, and it often initializes a color sequence, with subsequent colors dependent on context.",-3.09989536612,49,dax
"Rule: dax -> Outputs one green for each syllable in the following word. 

Explanation:
- ""walm"" has one syllable, so ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green.""
- ""bluf"" has one syllable, so ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green.""
- ""zup"" has one syllable but appears to have some condition that changes the second output to yellow, so ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow.""
- However, when ""dax"" is used in conjunction with ""lug wif,"" the pattern does not hold the same. ""lug wif lug"" outputs ""blue red blue,"" and it follows by ""dax bluf"" which outputs ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" still represents one green for each syllable in the next word, despite the words that come before it.
- ""lug wif dax"" following the prior logic and ignoring the ""lug wif"" sequence would mean ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" corresponding to the next word, which is one syllable.

Note: Since there is one instance where ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow,"" there may be additional rules not apparent from the examples given. However, with the provided data, the rule about syllables is consistent except for this one example.",-3.7862297313399997,49,dax
"Rule: dax corresponds to a sequence of colors starting with green, where the sequence's length and colors are determined by the word that follows dax. The first instance of dax is always followed by green. The following pattern can be observed from the examples:

1. walm following dax leads to a triple repetition of green followed by red: ""green green green red red red.""
2. bluf following dax leads to a double repetition of green: ""green green.""
3. zup following dax leads to green followed by yellow: ""green yellow.""
4. A single instance of dax without a following word gives just one green: ""green.""

If the word after dax is not in the examples given, dax is followed by green and potentially other colors in an unknown pattern.

Therefore, dax acts as a marker for a sequence of colors, with the subsequent word defining the specific sequence.

So the rule is:
dax -> A marker for a sequence of colors, the specifics of the sequence are defined by the word that follows dax.",-4.49178928182,49,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to figure out the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax."" Let's examine each input and its corresponding output to determine a pattern.

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green

5. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green

Observations:

- Whenever dax appears at the beginning of the input, the corresponding output starts with green.
- The word that follows dax seems to define the number of times green occurs in the output.
   - In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens followed by other colors. This means ""walm"" could be associated with the number 3.
   - In the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is two greens. So ""bluf"" could be associated with the number 2.

- When ""dax"" appears later in the sequence, as in the fourth input, it seems to 'reset' the output color sequence back to green.
- In the third input, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green followed by yellow. ""Zup"" might be associated with the color yellow and since ""dax"" precedes it, ""dax"" itself does not seem to replace ""zup,"" but to set the output color back to green before it turns yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule related to ""dax"" can be interpreted as follows:

Rule:
- ""dax"" resets the color sequence to green.
- The number of times green is repeated in the output corresponds to the meaning of the word following ""dax,"" suggesting a number association (e.g., ""bluf"" seems to mean 2, ""walm"" seems to mean 3).
- After the series of green induced by ""dax,"" the color sequence continues based on other words (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).

So, dax -> Resets the color sequence to green and the number of greens corresponds to the value associated with the following word.",-6.783700490624,49,dax

To make a rule for ""wif,"" we'll look at other words:
- ""dax"" appears to translate to ""green"" (second and third inputs)
- ""walm"" appears at the end of a sequence, followed by three ""red"" which could suggest that ""walm"" is related to repeating the word before it.

- ""bluf"" does not have a clear translation but based on the last input, it might mean ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when looking at the third and last inputs.

From these observations, it is evident that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the context within the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is as follows:

- Whenever we see ""wif bluf"" it translates to ""red red.""
- Whenever we see ""bluf"" not immediately preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to ""blue.""

This inference is made by isolating the occurrences of ""bluf"" and identifying the patterns in the outputs:

1. ""lug wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue blue"" - here ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and since ""bluf"" comes right after ""lug"" (meaning ""blue""), ""bluf"" becomes ""blue"" as well.
   
2. ""wif lug bluf wif"" translates to ""red blue blue red"" - as before, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" but ""bluf"" is ""blue"" after ""lug"" and not after ""wif"".
   
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"" - ""bluf"" comes right after ""wif,"" so it is ""red"" in this instance.
   
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" - where ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" showing that its translation to ""yellow"" is not consistent and likely context-dependent; however, ""wif bluf"" again translates to ""red red"".
   
5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" - where ""bluf"" is directly following ""wif,"" so it is again ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> means ""blue,"" except when immediately following ""wif,"" where it means ""red"".",-2.46761403834,49,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond directly to the color ""blue."" However, there are also instances that follow a pattern where the ""bluf"" is not translated to ""blue"" but rather repeats the color that precedes it.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red when ""wif"" is present before it and blue when ""lug"" precedes it. There are no instances of ""bluf"" standing alone or in a different context to determine its color without one of these two words adjacent to it. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
   - Example: ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red""

2. When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the pattern for the nonce word ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and their respective outputs.

From the examples, we observe the following:
- Whenever ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax"", the sequence ""green green green"" is produced.
- Whenever ""walm"" is preceded by any word other than ""dax"", a sequence of three colors identical to the color corresponding to the preceding word is generated.
- In the absence of a word before ""walm"", it defaults to a sequence of three reds.

Here are the observations written out:

1. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
   (The sequence starts with a green for ""dax"", yellow for ""zup"", then repeats green for ""dax"", and ""walm"" produces three more greens.)

2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
   (""lug"" leads to blue, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and produces three more greens.)

3. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
   (""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""walm"" after ""dax"" thus three greens, and ""zup"" to yellow.)

4. dax walm zup walm -> green green green yellow yellow yellow
   (Starts with green for ""dax"", ""walm"" then produces three greens, ""zup"" yields yellow, and ""walm"" without a different word in front repeats the ""yellow"" three times.)

5. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
   (""wif"" transitions to red, ""walm"" with nothing but ""wif"" in front repeats the red three times, then ""zup"" gives a yellow.)

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", then output three green colors.
- If ""walm"" follows any other word, output three instances of the color that corresponds to the preceding word.
- In the absence of a specific rule about what comes before ""walm"", it defaults to a sequence of three reds.

Therefore:

walm -> A sequence of three colors. The color depends on the preceding word: if preceded by ""dax,"" the sequence is green; otherwise, it repeats the color associated with the preceding word (defaulting to red if no color-coding is established).

Rule: If ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" output green green green; if any other word precedes ""walm,"" repeat the corresponding color of the preceding word three times; if alone or no context is provided, assume red red red.",-1.0660891676359998,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the provided input and output pairs.

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the sequence always has an additional ""green"" in the output:
   - Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
   - Input: lug dax walm -> Output: blue green green green
   - Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" there is an additional ""red"" in the sequence:
   - Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow

3. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output ends with ""yellow"":
   - Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green
   - Input: lug wif dax walm zup -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
   - Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

4. Additionally, when ""walm"" is used twice in succession, the color of the second ""walm"" is based on the first occurrence:
   - Input: dax walm zup walm -> Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Putting these observations together, we can deduce a rule:

""walm"" likely introduces a repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it, where:
- If preceded by ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""green(s)""
- If preceded by ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""red(s)""
- If preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" results in additional ""yellow(s)""
- If preceded by another ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the preceding ""walm""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-4.809712584754375,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns corresponding to the other words and their outputs.

- ""dax"" always precedes a single green output.
- ""zup"" always follows either green or red outputs and is followed by yellow.
- ""lug"" is always followed by blue and precedes greens (if it precedes ""dax"" or ""walm"").
- ""wif"" produces red outputs, and its presence seems to turn the following outputs red until we encounter ""zup,"" which switches back to yellow.

Now let's look at the behavior of ""walm"":

1. In every instance ""walm"" is used, there are three greens in the output.
2. The three greens follow whatever color output is associated with the word immediately before ""walm.""
3. When ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the yellow follows the greens.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it generates three green outputs in a row, regardless of what precedes it.

Rule: walm -> three consecutive green outputs.",-6.938743497454,49,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we should look for patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

3. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

4. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

Now let's analyze the ""walm"" occurrences and the colors that follow it:

- In example 1, after ""walm,"" there are three greens.
- In example 2, after ""walm,"" there are three greens.
- In example 3, after ""walm,"" there are two greens followed by a yellow.
- In example 4, after the first ""walm,"" there is a yellow, and after the second ""walm,"" there are two more yellows.
- In example 5, after ""walm,"" there are three reds.

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times, unless ""zup"" follows after ""walm,"" which then results in yellow (as seen in the third and fourth examples, and taking into account that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first list the outputs following each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
2. lug walm -> blue blue blue
3. wif walm dax -> red red red green
4. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

Looking at these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times regardless of what the color is, followed by the original color associated with the next word.

Let's break this down further:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which normally produces green. The output after ""walm"" is three yellows (associated with ""zup"" preceding ""walm"") followed by green.
- In the second example, ""lug"" normally translates to blue, and after ""walm,"" it's indeed blue repeated three times.
- In the third instance, ""dax"" after ""walm"" should be green. Before ""walm,"" ""wif"" is red, so the output is three reds followed by the green associated with ""dax.""
- In the fourth instance, ""zup"" generally means yellow, and ""walm"" is followed by ""zup."" The output is three instances of green (from ""dax"" before ""walm"") followed by yellow.
- In the fifth instance, ""dax"" both precedes and follows ""walm,"" which means it should be green, and this is reflected in the output as three greens, and there is no color change because ""dax"" comes after ""walm.""

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" seems to cause the output color associated with the word before it to repeat three times, followed by the color that would normally be associated with the word after it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times, followed by the color associated with the following word.",-4.62027008914,51,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color that would be assigned to the word immediately preceding it.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats this color (yellow) three times.

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats this color (blue) three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   The word ""wif"" corresponds to red, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats this color (red) three times. Later in the sequence, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""walm,"" which again repeats blue three times.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats this color (green) three times.

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   The word ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""walm,"" which repeats this color (green) three times.

Based on the examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" can be articulated as:
walm -> Repeating the color of the preceding word three times.",-6.017922742027,51,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Let's examine the patterns:

1. In the first example, ""zup walm dax"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that the word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""

2. The second example, ""lug walm,"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

3. In the third example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red"" and later ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it three times.

4. The fourth and fifth examples further support this rule. The word preceding ""walm"" dictates the color that is output three times in a row.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-7.11337323914,51,walm
"Comparing the input phrases with their corresponding output colors, we can observe the following patterns associated with the word ""walm"":

1. In every input where ""walm"" is present, the output consists of a repetition of three identical colors.
2. These repeated colors are not necessarily dependent on the word that immediately precedes or follows ""walm"".
3. The color created by ""walm"" in the output seems to be determined by the word preceding ""walm"" in the input. For example:
   - When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" (as in the first input), the output is three yellows.
   - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (as seen in various inputs), the output is three greens.
   - When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" (as in the second input), the output is three blues.
   - It is not clear what color ""wif"" produces since it does not directly precede ""walm"" in any of the inputs provided.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule for the meaning of ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word thrice in the output.

Rule: If X is the color associated with the word that comes just before ""walm"", then ""walm"" causes the output to be X X X (three times X).",-7.33433681116,51,walm
"Analyzing the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Looking at the patterns, it's notable that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the color green is repeated three times in the output. No other words seem to cause a thrice-repeated color in the output. The color that follows the three greens seems to correspond with the word that follows ""walm"" in the input (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue).

Based on this pattern, we can propose a rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it produces three green outputs in a row, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it.

Therefore:

walm -> three green outputs in sequence.",-9.18161178486,51,walm

- In the second input ""lug walm zup"", the first word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow"".

- The fourth example ""dax wif lug"" yields ""green red blue,"" showing ""dax"" as ""green,"" ""wif"" as ""red,"" and ""lug"" again as ""blue"".

"Based on the examples provided, the transformation from 'bluf' to its output seems to consistently produce the output 'red red'. However, each instance of 'bluf' in the inputs has been accompanied by a different word which, in turn, has outputted a color once or twice, that corresponds to the word preceding 'bluf', followed by 'red red'.

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after that, we see 'blue blue', without a separate 'red red'.

2. Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
   Again, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', and after that, we see 'blue blue', as in the previous example.

3. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
   'wif' seems to correspond to 'red', 'bluf' should then output 'red red', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf -> Output: blue blue blue red red
   Here 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'walm' to 'blue', and 'wif' to 'red', followed by 'bluf' which outputs 'red red'.

5. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
   'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', then comes 'bluf', which should output 'red red' according to the rule we're deducing, followed by 'wif' which corresponds to 'red', and 'walm', which again corresponds to 'red'.

From these examples, we can induce a potential rule for 'bluf': 'bluf' consistently outputs 'red red', possibly appending the color corresponding to the word right before it.

However, the first two examples seem to contradict this if we apply this rule, as we don't see 'red red' after the color corresponding to 'lug' ('blue'). There might be an error or additional context not covered by the examples given.

To make a rule based on the data provided, while acknowledging there's some ambiguity, the rule could be:

Rule: 'bluf' outputs 'red red' after the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it, with the exception that when 'lug' precedes 'bluf', the output is only the color corresponding to 'lug' twice (as seen in the given examples).

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the patterns between the input and the output.

In the first input, ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue green red blue red."" The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" we can infer that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""dax"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" showing that the presence of ""walm"" introduces two additional ""blue"" before the next color that corresponds to the following word.

In the second input, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" The word ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears after ""lug,"" and we see two additional ""blue"" in the output.

In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" turns into ""green green green red red red yellow."" We can see that ""walm"" follows ""dax"" for three ""green"" and follows ""wif"" for three ""red."" ""Zup"" has not appeared in previous examples, but its output is ""yellow,"" so we can infer that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" hence ""walm"" after ""dax"" gives two additional ""green.""

The fifth example, ""wif lug dax walm,"" changes to ""red blue green green green."" The pattern here also follows, with ""dax"" being ""green"" and ""walm"" adding two more ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the output to be three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word that follows ""walm."" If there is no word following ""walm,"" the last mentioned color is repeated three times. Therefore:

walm -> Triplicates the next color in the sequence (or the last mentioned color if none follows). Rule.",-1.0112060094120001,52,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the examples provided, let's consider the outputs and their correspondence with the inputs.

- In the first example, the sequence ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" in the output. The only instance of ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of three blue colors.
- In the second example, the sequence ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue"" with ""walm"" again corresponding to a sequence of blue colors but appended after ""blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow"" with each ""walm"" corresponding to a sequence of green colors following the pattern of ""dax walm"" from a previous example and ""wif walm"" resulting in additional reds.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" corresponds to an additional two green colors after ""green.""
- The fifth example ""wif lug dax walm"" is ""red blue green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in additional green colors.

Having analyzed the given input-output pairs, it appears that ""walm"" induces repetition or extension of a sequence of colors based on the color that precedes it. For example, after ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, ""walm"" adds more green. The rule applied seems to be that ""walm"" extends the sequence of the previous color.

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> repeats the prior color in the sequence.

Note: This rule is based on the provided examples; further examples might reveal additional rules or exceptions.",-1.137150835952,52,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, walm appears to mean repeating the color of the last mentioned known keyword. For instance, when the last color-coded word is 'dax' (which corresponds to green), 'walm' leads to a repetition of green. When 'lug' is the last known keyword before 'walm' (and 'lug' corresponds to blue), 'walm' results in the color blue being repeated. 

Rule: 
1. Identify the color associated with the word immediately preceding 'walm'.
2. Repeat that color for the output of 'walm'.",-9.03450600368,52,walm
"Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" translates to ""green"" repeated once more than the number of times ""walm"" has occurred consecutively. 

Thus, when ""walm"" appears:

- Once, it is followed by ""green green""
- Twice in a row, it is followed by ""green green green"" for each occurrence.

Using this rule:

- In the first example, ""walm"" generates ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" has been established to translate to ""blue"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" directly after ""lug"".
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" results in ""green green green"" each time it appears because ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" after ""dax"" generates ""green green green"".

Therefore, walm -> ""green"" repeated one more time than its consecutive occurrences.",-9.12862878589,52,walm

2. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output color is always green and repeated thrice.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output color is always green and preceded by red.

So the rule appears to be that the color for ""walm"" depends on the word that precedes it, and often includes repetition or an association with the color produced by the preceding word. Specifically:

- After ""lug"", the color is blue (no repetition in the example given).
- After ""dax"", the color is green and repeated three times.
- After ""wif"", the color is green but with red preceding it.

3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

From example 1, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since it's around ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""dax"" in this instance translates to the word ""green.""

In example 2, the only word beside ""dax"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" maintaining the consistency of ""dax"" being ""green.""

The pattern of ""dax"" being ""green"" holds up in example 3 as well, as it alternates with the word ""wif,"" which has been established to mean ""red."" The remaining words, ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" correspond to ""yellow.""

Example 4 is more complex but adheres to the established pattern; ""lug"" is still ""blue,"" and the appearance of ""dax"" nearer to the end follows a pattern of repetition. ""Walm"" seems to be a repeating sequence of ""green,"" with the number of repetitions equalling the positions away from ""dax"" it is. When ""lug"" comes right after ""dax,"" which means ""green,"" the sequence is ""green blue blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" could relate to repeating the next word's corresponding color once before it.

Example 5 strengthens the idea that ""walm"" indeed means a sequence of ""green,"" which would match the earlier idea of repeating the subsequent word. But since ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" we might expect ""dax"" to be simply ""green"" as it leads the sequence.

With these analyses, there's no evidence to contradict the simplicity of ""dax"" meaning ""green."" It does not seem to change based on position or context in the provided examples. Thus, we can induce the rule:

- In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" results in ""yellow green,"" so once more ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, we don’t have a ""yellow"" directly following ""zup,"" but instead a sequence of ""red red red yellow,"" which may imply that ""zup"" can affect multiple consecutive items in the sequence.

Putting these observations together, it seems clear that ""zup"" has the effect of changing the color sequence that follows. Whenever ""zup"" is included in the input, the following items are ""yellow"" instead of their regular colors, until a new regular color appears.

The rule for ""zup"" might also be that it serves as a reset or override for the color that directly follows it, turning that color into ""yellow."" However, since in some cases the ""yellow"" color persists beyond just the next item in the sequence, it appears that ""zup"" can sometimes change a sequence of colors to ""yellow,"" potentially until the sequence is broken by a different color or sequence effect. Therefore, the exact change in pattern regarding length and condition after ""zup"" is unclear and might need more examples to fully understand.

Given this information, we can preliminarily define ""zup"" with the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" changes the expected color output to ""yellow"" for at least the item that follows it, and potentially for a sequence that follows until another color or reset condition appears. 

zup -> meaning. Rule: Resets the color sequence to ""yellow.""",-6.59756621942,53,zup
"Analyzing the provided examples, I will attempt to deduce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup.""

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
    - Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
    - ""walm"" after ""wif"" corresponds to ""blue"" (as seen at the end of the sequence), but ""walm"" alone corresponds to ""green""
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
    - After ""zup,"" ""wif"" changes from ""red"" to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" changes from ""green/blue"" to ""yellow.""

2. zup lug
    - Output: yellow blue
    - ""lug"" remains ""blue"" after ""zup""

3. zup wif lug zup walm
    - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
    - ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red""
    - ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating the presence of ""zup"" might be turning everything that follows into ""yellow.""

4. zup dax
    - Output: yellow green
    - Normally, ""dax"" is ""green,"" so here ""zup"" might be not affecting ""dax.""

5. dax walm wif walm zup
    - Output: green green green red red red yellow
    - Everything after ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" as ""walm,"" which normally would be ""blue"" after ""wif,"" is listed as ""yellow.""

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" has the effect of changing the color association of some (but possibly not all) following words to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> causes the following words to change color to yellow, with some exceptions depending on the following word (e.g., ""dax"" remains green).",-6.9615175227099995,53,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we should look for patterns in each example. Here's the analysis:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is always red.
2. Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output is always blue.
3. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is always green.
4. The output for ""lug"" is a consistent blue.

With these observations, we can infer the following from the given examples:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""walm"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue

Now we need to derive the pattern for ""zup.""

In the first example, the presence of ""zup"" seems to trigger a change from ""red"" to ""green"" and ""yellow"" outputs, regardless of the preceding words, and then back to ""blue,"" following the pattern for ""lug"" and ""walm"" without interruption.

However, in the second example, ""zup"" is directly followed by ""lug"", and the output is ""yellow blue,"" consistent with ""lug"" outputting blue.

In the third example, ""zup"" appears in the sequence, and each appearance of ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" regardless of the next word.

In the fourth example, ""zup dax"" outputs ""yellow green,"" and since ""dax"" always outputs green, ""zup"" here again results in ""yellow.""

The fifth example is essential, as ""zup"" is the last word, yet there is a string of ""red"" followed by ""yellow,"" corresponding to the sequence of ""wif walm wif walm zup."" The reds are for ""wif,"" and the blues are for ""walm.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""zup"" might be a modifier that changes the output pattern to ""yellow"" regardless of the following word:

In the second example:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

The third example is consistent with zup being yellow and wif being red, walm being yellow, and lug being blue.

The fourth example reconfirms that dax is green and zup is yellow.

The fifth example is consistent with previous identifiers for dax and walm, and reaffirms that zup is yellow.

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""dax"" -> green

To verify this, we can look at the given outputs and inputs:

- In ""wif bluf zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red,"" which is the color associated with ""wif."" Then ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"" again.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and its output is ""blue,"" the same as ""lug."" The pattern holds for the rest of the sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns between inputs and outputs, paying attention to the repetition and positioning of colors in the output that correspond to instances of ""walm.""

Input: lug walm zup

Input: dax lug walm

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- After ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax,"" ""walm"" translates to three greens.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" and ""wif,"" resulting in red repeated three times, followed by a blue after a ""lug.""

Given these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" becomes a sequence of three colors that follow a certain rule. It appears that ""walm"" might derive its color sequence from the color immediately preceding it, repeating that color three times. However, in the case where ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" a blue follows the repetition. The following rule can be derived:

Rule:
- When ""walm"" is preceded by another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times.
- If ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" an additional blue is appended to the output after the three repeated colors.

- In the first example, ""bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red blue yellow."" Since ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""zup"" to yellow consistently in other examples, it seems that ""bluf"" translates to red.

2. In example 2, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" Again, ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of the color before it which, in this case, is green (associated with ""dax"").

3. In example 3, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red."" This reinforces the hypothesis that ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to repeat.

4. In example 4, ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" seems to cause the color of ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times each.

5. In example 5, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Here, ""walm"" again has caused ""wif"" (red) to repeat three times.

If we look at the color sequences and their positions relative to the word ""walm"" in the input, it appears that ""walm"" might represent repetition of the color immediately following it in the sequence of the input. Let's check this with the examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" follows ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red blue,"" so ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""walm"" represents three repetitions of ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" makes three greens appear in the output, which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and, following the pattern, ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be outputted three times.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by nothing since ""lug"" comes before ""wif walm,"" leading to ""red red red,"" which is consistent with the repetition rule of ""walm.""

4. In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" which is consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" and ""walm"" repeating it three times. Furthermore, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which supports ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again causes the repetition.

   ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and both are translated to ""green."" This does not provide any additional information about ""dax"" alone since ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: wif dax | Output: red green
   ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"" again.

4. Input: dax lug dax | Output: green blue green
   ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and the end and is consistent with the meaning ""green."" ""lug"" is between them and translates to ""blue.""

5. Input: lug wif dax | Output: blue red green
   Here, ""dax"" is at the end and again corresponds to ""green.""

Looking at these examples, whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, it consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it. The surrounding words all have their unique color associations, which seem independent of the meaning of ""dax.""

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf"" let's inspect the input-output pairs given. Each input seems to contain a nonce word (dax, lug, wif, zup) followed by ""bluf,"" and the output contains one or two color words.

Here is a breakdown of the outputs associated with the given inputs:

- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
- ""zup bluf"" (twice) -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

Notice that:

- When ""bluf"" is paired with ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might translate to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" causes the color word to be repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output is ""blue red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated. This fits the earlier notion that ""bluf"" causes the repeat, as ""wif"" seems to translate to ""red.""
- ""zup bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and, as before, ""bluf"" causes the color word to repeat.
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red,"" further supporting the repetition pattern associated with ""bluf.""

Thus, the most consistent rule that we can deduce is:

Rule: bluf -> causes the color word that Precedes ""bluf"" to be repeated.",-1.37164495428,55,bluf

"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word. Rule:

Each nonce word before ""bluf"" is associated with a unique color:

- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

- ""lug"" correlates with blue.
- ""zup"" correlates with yellow.
- ""wif"" correlates with red.

When ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated twice.

Therefore: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word twice.",-2.81661243756,55,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs in each example. We have:

Input: dax bluf  | Output: green green
Input: lug wif bluf | Output: blue red red
Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
Input: wif bluf | Output: red red

An initial observation is that the output is always a repetition of a color word, and the color seems to correlate to the input word that immediately precedes ""bluf."" The input word that comes before ""bluf"" is matched with a color as follows:

dax -> green
lug -> blue
zup -> yellow
wif -> red

Given this pattern, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" functions as a command or operation to repeat the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows a word, the output is the color associated with that word repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> results in the repetition of the color that the preceding nonce word represents.",-8.198366919168,55,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, walm seems to mirror the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

In the first example, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green,"" which implies that walm takes on the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

In the second example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" We see that walm takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here walm takes the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

In the fourth example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Walm takes the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'walm' is a word that causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding it, multiple times. The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times that preceding color word has occurred previously in the input sequence.

Let's examine the provided examples to understand the rule:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   'dax' corresponds to the color green, and 'walm' causes this color to repeat three times. Since 'dax' is mentioned once before 'walm', the output is three 'green'.

2. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   'lug' corresponds to the color blue, and 'walm' comes after 'zup', which corresponds to yellow. 'zup' is mentioned once before 'walm', so the output is three yellow's following 'zup'.

3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   'lug' precedes 'walm' here, and 'lug' appears once before 'walm', resulting in the output repeating 'blue' three times.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   'zup' comes before 'walm' and has appeared once before 'walm', leading to three yellow's in the output.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here 'lug' comes before 'walm' and it has appeared once before 'walm', which results in the output repeating 'blue' three times.

Thus, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. The word is repeated a number of times equal to one plus the number of times the preceding color word has appeared previously in the input sequence.

Therefore, walm -> causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it, n+1 times, where n is the number of times the preceding color word has appeared in the input sequence before 'walm'.",-6.877145415416999,55,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the output seems to be tied to repeating the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" Here's the breakdown:

- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the output is ""green green green"". 
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", resulting in a double ""yellow"" in the output before the following ""lug"" which is ""blue"".
- In ""lug walm wif zup wif"", ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""blue"", resulting in a triple ""blue"" in the output before ""wif"" which is ""red"".

Following this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" three times. Therefore:

Each word corresponds to a color, with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""walm"" corresponding to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"". The repetition happens with the same number of colors as initially presented before the word ""zup"".

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif walm zup walm"", we see ""red yellow"" before zup and the repetition of ""red yellow yellow"" after zup, which indicates that the pattern before zup (red, yellow) should be repeated with the next word(s) (walm), and since walm corresponds to yellow, it is repeated twice to finish the pattern.
- In the second example, ""lug zup wif zup"", it follows the same pattern with ""blue"" being before the first zup, then ""red"" before the second zup, with the pattern repeating ""yellow"" after each zup.
- In the third example, ""wif zup"", we have ""red"" before zup and then ""yellow"" after zup, following the same logic.
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"", ""yellow"" comes first, followed by the pattern ""red yellow yellow"", indicating that the color sequence starts with the first color following ""zup"".
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm zup walm"", the pattern ""blue blue blue"" before zup is followed by ""yellow yellow yellow"" after zup, repeating the color of ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule is that zup indicates a point where the sequence of colors should start repeating from the previous color pattern established before ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> indicates the repetition of the color sequence pattern established before it.",-5.061379658300001,56,zup
"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" is a word that changes the color indicated by the previous word to yellow. The change persists for one repetition of the color, before returning to the original color associated with the word.

Here is the breakdown:

- When the word ""wif"" (which translates to red) is followed by ""zup,"" the output color turns to yellow, and then it returns to red.
- When the word ""lug"" (which translates to blue) is followed by ""zup,"" the output color turns to yellow, and then it returns to blue.

- In the second example, ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" In this case, ""wif"" is red, and ""zup"" is yellow. The first occurrence of ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" and thus, ""red"" is repeated three times. The second occurrence of ""walm"" is also after ""wif,"" and again, ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Again, ""walm"" is after ""lug"" (blue), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times, and it is not affecting the subsequent color ""red"" which is associated with ""wif.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""

2. wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Rule: wif -> red",-7.32434343644,57,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" However, there seems to be an additional rule or pattern that dictates that the output color repeats corresponding to the number of times a word appears in a sequence.

Let's analyze the examples to understand this:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" appears once and the color ""green"" is output once. ""Zup"" appears once and ""yellow"" is output once.

2. In the second example, there are no repeats in the input, and the word ""zup"" appears once, followed by ""bluf"" once. The output is two yellows, which indicates that ""zup"" could mean ""yellow,"" and the repetition rule applies since ""zup"" and the following word ""bluf"" appear side by side.

3. The third example has ""dax"" once, followed by ""zup"" once, and other words each appearing once. The output is ""green yellow red red blue,"" following the rule that when ""zup"" is present, the output color yellow is repeated for the following word, which would be ""wif"" and translated to ""red.""

4. In the fourth example, the sequence ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" results in the color pattern ""blue green green yellow blue red,"" again showing the repetition of the color corresponding to ""zup"" for the following word ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears once at the beginning, followed by ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which are repeated terms, so ""yellow"" is output three times.

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" and when ""zup"" is present, the output color yellow is repeated for the following word as well (considering the following word as a color term being translated).

zup -> yellow (with repetition effect on the following color term).",-5.35872083914,57,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's look at the common denominator in each output whenever ""zup"" is used in the input.

1. The first and second examples show that ""zup"" on its own yields ""yellow"" as output. This suggests that ""zup"" could potentially mean ""yellow.""

2. However, it's essential to see ""zup"" in context with other words to check for consistency:

    - In the first example, when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow.""
    - In the third example, when ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" the output is also ""yellow.""
    - In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" and again, the output is ""yellow.""
    - In the fifth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and once more, the output is ""yellow.""

3. Another pattern to note is that when ""zup"" follows a word, the preceding word tends to not alter its corresponding color in the output. For instance, ""walm"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" regardless of whether ""zup"" follows.

Given the consistent response and no indication of ""zup"" affecting or being affected by the preceding word, the inductive rule we can derive is that ""zup"" independently translates to ""yellow,"" regardless of the context in which it is used.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-10.19926918964,57,zup
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Moreover, the other nonce words seem to correspond to other specific colors regardless of where they appear in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is:

zup -> yellow",-11.02147339554,57,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Looking at the examples:

1. When ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" the output is yellow (... walm zup -> ... green yellow).
2. When ""zup"" stands alone or at the beginning, the output is yellow (zup -> yellow).
3. When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is green, and for ""zup"" is yellow (dax zup -> green yellow).
4. When ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" which always outputs as green, ""zup"" itself outputs yellow (bluf zup -> green yellow).

In all instances, regardless of the word that precedes ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" is consistent - yellow. This indicates that ""zup"" always outputs as the color yellow, regardless of context within these examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-11.498147070848,57,zup
"Based on the given examples, a pattern can be observed where the word 'zup' is always translated to 'yellow'. There's no context provided that suggests 'zup' changes meaning based on position or surrounding words. Thus, the simplest deduction would be that 'zup' directly translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-12.344017814039997,57,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's first identify the patterns associated with the other words and their corresponding colors:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" but it's also associated with ""yellow"" when paired with ""zup."" Since ""dax zup lug zup bluf"" gives us ""green yellow blue yellow yellow,"" we see that ""lug"" only corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""dax.""

Now, observing the outputs associated with ""bluf,"" we have:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Since we know that ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is blue, it follows that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" must also be yellow.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red."" Since there's no other word for comparison, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding word, which here is ""wif"" and is red.
- In all other examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by a word and the output color for ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that comes before it.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-2.360764216012,57,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word 'bluf' consistently results in an 'Output' where the last two colors are the same and match the color produced by the word immediately preceding 'bluf'. To determine the meaning of 'bluf', let's analyze the examples. 

In the first example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""red red.""

In the third example, the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and the output after ""bluf"" is ""yellow yellow.""

Similarly, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""bluf"" produces two of the same colors as the word just before it.

From these observations, we can deduce that 'bluf' indicates that the following color should be repeated twice, and this color should match the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before 'bluf'.

   - ""dax"" -> green
   - ""lug"" -> blue
   - ""wif"" -> red

3. The output colors seem to appear in the same order as their corresponding words in the input.

- ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue"" (noted twice)
- ""lug walm wif lug"" follows the established pattern with ""walm"" yielding ""blue blue blue"", but there is an additional color ""red"" before the final ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug.""
- ""dax walm zup lug walm"" includes ""walm"" twice, first yielding ""green green green"" after ""dax"" and then ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug"" with an additional ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" inserted in between.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" acts as a modifier that means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. Here are the observations that support this conclusion:

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"", which indicates that ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" includes the ""wif"" element changing the sequence by introducing red once before continuing with blue. It suggests that ""walm"" repeats the color (blue), but can be interrupted by another color indication (in this case, ""wif"" for red).
- In ""dax walm zup lug walm"", the ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats the associated color (green) three times, and then after ""zup"" and ""lug"", ""walm"" follows the same pattern by repeating the colors associated with the last mentioned colors (yellow and blue, respectively).

- In the second example, the input is solely ""dax"" and the output is green.

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is at the end of the input sequence and corresponds to green in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" appears at the end after a sequence of other words and colors, and the corresponding output is green.

- When ""dax"" is the only word in the input, the output is solely ""green.""
- The presence of other words such as ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to other colors irrespective of the presence of ""dax.""

- When other words are present without ""wif,"" they have their own corresponding colors (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"").
- When ""wif"" is present with a sequence of words, including other nonce words, it seems that ""wif"" repeats the color ""red"" for itself plus every word that follows it until another color word is encountered.

From this, we can induce that the rule for ""wif"" is that it generates a ""red"" for itself and each subsequent word following it until a new color-coded word appears.

Rule: wif -> Generates a ""red"" for itself and for each word following it until a new color word is encountered.",-4.4118717681,58,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" from the given examples, let's examine each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif | Output: red -> One instance of ""wif"", one instance of ""red"".
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red -> One instance of ""wif"", three instances of ""red"".
3. Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red -> One instance of ""wif"" at the end, resulting in one ""red"" at the end; ""dax walm"" seems to translate to ""green green green"".

5. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red -> ""wif"" occurs three times corresponding to three instances of ""red"" at three different points in the sequence.

From these examples, an observable pattern is that the output ""red"" appears every time ""wif"" is used. However, ""wif"" seems to slightly influence the behavior of the words that follow it since the number of ""red"" outputs does not always correspond directly to the number of ""wif"" instances.

Based on these examples, a possible rule could be that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and it may also affect the repeated output of ""red"" depending on its position and the words that follow it. However, the examples are not enough to deduce a clear, consistent rule about the influence on the following words, as ""walm"" and ""bluf"" seem to have their repetitions after ""wif.""

Given the constraints that we have, a tentative rule could be: 

Rule: When ""wif"" occurs in a sequence, it outputs ""red"" and may cause repetition of ""red"" depending on the context.

Admittedly, this rule might be incomplete due to the complexity of the examples. More examples would be needed to refine the rule, especially examining how ""wif"" interacts with different words and in various positions.

"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for a pattern that is consistent in each instance the word occurs. In each example, ""bluf"" is present and we see the word ""red"" appear twice immediately following the sequence containing ""bluf.""

4. Input: ""wif dax zup bluf"" → Output: ""red green yellow yellow""
5. Input: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" → Output: ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

When “bluf” is mentioned in the input:
- In example 1, it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup.""
- In example 2, it follows ""wif.""
- In example 3, it again follows ""wif.""
- In example 4, it follows ""zup.""
- In example 5, it follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""wif.""

The constants before and after ""bluf"" seem to not influence its output. The outputs always seem to include a double ""red"" following the items listed before ""bluf."" None of the other inputs, when occurring without ""bluf,"" result in the ""red red"" pattern in the output. It seems that ""bluf"" directly results in ""red red"" in the output sequence, indicating its meaning could be related to a pair of reds.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a static color. Instead, it might depend on the context or the placement within the sequence. The consistent element is that ""bluf"" always translates to ""red"" or includes ""red"" when it is at the end of the sequence.

However, the current examples do not provide enough context to specify a concrete rule for ""bluf."" The connections between ""bluf"" and specific output colors are inconsistent, except that the presence of ""bluf"" guarantees a ""red"" in the output somewhere after its appearance.

1. lug walm -> blue blue blue

3. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Following ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" is supposed to repeat the color before it, yellow, four times (one for the ""lug"" after ""walm"" plus three). However, there's an extra ""lug"" after ""walm"" which is not repeated. So, it appears that ""lug"" after ""walm"" is not influencing the pattern here.

Disregarding the additional blue in the third example, which might be an inconsistency or a different rule that we do not have enough information to understand, the rule can be outlined as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of words following ""walm"" plus one.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word, the number of repetitions equals the count of words following 'walm' plus one.",-1.1337649063259998,58,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" when directly following a color word seems to trigger the repetition of that color word's corresponding color. Each color word is associated with a color (lug -> blue, dax -> green, bluf -> blue, zup -> yellow, wif -> red), and ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times. If the color word is repeated before walm (e.g., lug lug walm), then it seems to cause the color to repeat as many times as the preceding color word plus one additional repetition. If ""walm"" follows multiple different color words, the sequence generated seems to repeat the corresponding colors of each of the preceding color words in order of their appearance plus one additional repetition.",-7.54769432242,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's focus on how its presence affects the output in each example. In each case, ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of a color, which corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This repetition is one less than the number of words present before ""walm.""

For example:

- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue""; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and there is only one word before ""walm,"" so it repeats ""blue"" two more times (one less than the number of words).
- ""lug dax walm"" outputs ""blue green green green""; ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and there are two words before ""walm,"" so it repeats ""green"" three times (one less than the number of words).
- ""zup wif walm lug"" has two words before ""walm"" (which are ""zup"" and ""wif""), and it repeats ""red"" (which corresponds to ""wif"") three times (one less than the number of words).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, and the color is repeated one less than the total number of words that appear before ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" in the output, repeating it one less than the number of words present before ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-7.61192461472,58,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must examine the outputs in relation to their respective inputs. Analyzing the pairs:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   
2. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green

3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow

We can notice the following patterns:

- The presence of ""walm"" in the input always results in an output that repeats a color multiple times. 
- The number of times a color is repeated corresponds to the number of words in the input before ""walm."" 
- Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. From the examples, we can deduce that:
  ""lug"" -> blue
  ""dax"" -> green
  ""bluf"" -> cannot be determined from the given examples
  ""zup"" -> yellow
  ""wif"" -> red

So the rule regarding ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word directly preceding it, as many times as there are words before ""walm.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can observe that whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in any input, it causes the corresponding output to repeat the color of the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. For example, when ""dax bluf"" is the input, the output is ""green green,"" where ""green"" corresponds to the color associated with ""dax,"" and it is repeated after ""bluf.""

Here are the observations leading to the rule:

1. ""dax bluf zup"" -> ""green green yellow"" (The color for ""dax"" is 'green' and is repeated after ""bluf."")
2. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" (""lug"" is associated with 'blue,' which is repeated after ""bluf."")
3. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" (""wif"" is associated with 'red,' and 'red' follows ""bluf."")
4. ""wif bluf lug zup"" -> ""red red blue yellow"" (""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is associated with 'red,' hence 'red' is repeated.)
5. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" (""lug"" is associated with 'blue,' and 'blue' follows ""bluf."")

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: If ""x"" is the word before ""bluf,"" and ""x"" corresponds to a certain color, then the output for ""bluf"" will be the color corresponding to ""x.""",-1.1147176491,59,bluf
"In each example, the word ""bluf"" precedes a color in the corresponding output. In each case, the color that follows ""bluf"" matches the color of ""bluf"" itself:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- However, in the second example, ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds again to red.
- The fourth example also shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to red.
- The fifth example has ""bluf"" corresponding to blue.

Given that ""bluf"" corresponds to different colors in different contexts, it suggests that ""bluf"" is not statically associated with a specific color. The common factor seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the following word in the input. There are some inconsistencies, however, as ""bluf"" does not precede any word in the third example, yet it still produces ""red.""

Taking a closer look, let's consider that the color in the output is dependent also on the word that directly precedes ""bluf"":

- ""dax bluf"" resulted in ""green green"".
- ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue"".
- ""wif bluf"" consistently resulted in ""red red"".

So, it appears that ""bluf"" might adopt the color associated with the word preceding it. Since ""lug"" leads to blue and ""wif"" leads to red, ""bluf"" following these words becomes red or blue respectively. 

However, when ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" the resulting color is consistently green. This creates an inconsistency because ""dax"" also maps to green in the output on its own. It seems that ""dax"" forces a green color on the subsequent word, including ""bluf.""

To summarize, ""bluf"" seems to take on the color of the preceding word, except when it succeeds ""dax,"" where it always turns green, possibly because of the strong association between green and ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word except when it follows ""dax,"" where it turns green.",-4.135140952508,59,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" can be determined by identifying a pattern in the color correspondences. Across all examples, the output color following ""bluf"" is the same as the color before ""bluf"". Here is the observed pattern in the context provided:

- In ""dax bluf zup,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""bluf"" also leads to ""green.""
- In ""dax lug bluf wif,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also leads to ""blue.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also leads to ""red.""
- In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" once again ""wif"" leads to ""red"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""red.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" leads to ""blue.""

Given these examples, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color output of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".",-5.3787879411,59,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we'll look for patterns related to its position and surrounding words in the given examples:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
2. Input: dax lug bluf wif | Output: green blue blue red
3. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: lug bluf | Output: blue blue

Now let's analyze the occurrences:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, the output color that corresponds to ""bluf"" is the same color given to the word that precedes it.
- ""bluf"" doesn't always appear in the same position, which means its meaning isn't positional.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""wif"" to ""red"". Each time ""bluf"" follows one of these words, the color output is the same as for the preceding word.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the directly preceding word.",-5.64174762167,59,bluf
"Bluf -> meaning. Rule: The output for ""bluf"" is always the same color as the preceding word's output. If the preceding word's output is green, ""bluf"" outputs green. If the preceding word's output is red, ""bluf"" outputs red, and if the preceding word's output is blue, ""bluf"" outputs blue. If there's no preceding word (not present in the examples), we can't determine the output based on the given information.",-6.523701881399999,59,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" influences the output in the following way:

1. With each occurrence of ""wif"" and ""dax"":

- Input: ""wif lug dax walm"" -> Output: ""red blue green green green""
- Input: ""dax wif walm"" -> Output: ""green red red red""

After both ""wif"" and ""dax"", we notice additional ""reds"" in the output, suggesting that these inputs affect the meaning of ""walm."" However, the presence of ""lug"" seems consistent with the output of ""blue,"" regardless of ""walm.""

2. Independent of ""wif"" and ""dax"":

- Input: ""zup lug walm"" -> Output: ""yellow blue blue blue""
- Input: ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: ""yellow red red red blue""
- Input: ""dax lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""green blue red red red""

In these examples, after the word ""walm,"" there is a repetition of a color instead of introducing a new one, and that color is the same as the one generated just before ""walm"" (except in the case of ""lug"" which consistently stands for ""blue"").

Therefore, we can determine the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color word it follows (except when following ""lug"") until a new color is introduced by another input word.

Applying this rule:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green"" which is then followed by ""green green,"" because ""walm"" follows ""dax"" whose output is ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red,"" followed by ""red red red,"" because ""walm"" follows ""wif"" whose output is ""red.""

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be the following:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the most recent color (excluding any ""blue"" from ""lug""). If ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" it will result in ""blue"" being repeated. If it follows any other word, that word's color output is repeated.",-0.9623983482300001,59,walm
"Observing the examples, we notice a pattern where the output seems to repeatedly mention a color word for every occurrence of the word ""walm.""

Let's examine the output for each input:

- When ""wif"" is present, ""red"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" is in the output.

It appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated multiple times in the output, specifically three extra times. Notably, ""walm"" comes after a color-coded word in all examples.

For instance:

1. ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green,"" where ""green"" is repeated three times after ""dax,"" indicative of ""walm"" making ""green"" repeat.
2. ""zup lug walm"" outputs ""yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""lug,"" ascribable to ""walm"" making ""blue"" repeat.
3. ""zup wif walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red red red blue,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif,"" pointing to ""walm"" triggering the repetition of ""red.""
4. ""dax lug wif walm"" outputs ""green blue red red red,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif,"" also suggesting ""walm"" makes ""red"" repeat.
5. ""dax wif walm"" outputs ""green red red red,"" where ""red"" is repeated three times after ""wif,"" once again indicating ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word just before ""walm"" in the input to be repeated three additional times in the output.

Here are the observed patterns:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""
2. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
3. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""

Consequently, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows: ""walm"" causes the next color word to be tripled in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the output patterns in relation to the input examples.

In every output, the appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm."" Let's validate this by looking at each example:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green. There are three repetitions of green after ""walm.""

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. There are three repetitions of blue after ""walm.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. There are three repetitions of red followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.

4. Input: dax lug wif walm

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. There are three repetitions of red after ""walm.""

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" it translates to ""green green green,"" which seems to suggest that ""walm"" ensures the repetition of the color associated with ""dax.""
- In the ""zup dax walm zup wif"" input, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to follow the rule of tripling the color associated with the word just before it (in this case, ""green"" from ""dax""). ""Zup"" shows up twice and both times it corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""wif"" at the end turns into ""red.""
- With ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" seems to be ""red."" Following ""wif,"" ""walm"" again causes the repetition, this time of ""red.""
- In the last example, ""wif"" appears three times, corresponding with ""red"" each time. ""Dax"" remains consistently ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

- Lastly, ""wif dax wif lug wif"" produces a sequence where ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" ""dax"" is still ""green,"" and a new word ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

The most consistent observation we can make from the examples is that the nonce word ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

   - ""dax"" on its own translates to ""green"".

2. Input: dax walm

   - ""dax"" between ""zup"" and ""walm"" translates to ""green"". ""walm"" again has a ""green"" output for each syllable. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", both at the beginning and when repeated. ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red"".

4. Input: dax wif walm

With these observations, we can deduce a possible rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word 'walm' causes the output to repeat the color of the last word before 'walm' for a certain number of times. Here's the analysis:

Example 1: ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" The word 'walm' appears after 'zup', and 'yellow' is repeated three times before the next word 'dax' is translated to 'green'.

Example 2: ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, 'walm' follows 'lug', and 'blue' is repeated three times.

Example 3: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue."" 'Walm' comes after 'dax', and 'green' is repeated three times before 'lug' is translated to 'blue'.

Example 4: ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" 'Walm' follows 'zup', and 'yellow' is repeated three times before 'dax' translates to 'green'.

Example 5: ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" 'Walm' follows 'lug', and 'blue' is repeated three times.

From these examples, we can deduce that 'walm' means to repeat the color of the last word spoken before 'walm' three times before continuing with the next translations. If there's a word after 'walm', its corresponding color is stated after the three repetitions.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns and how the output colors relate to the input words:

In all of the given examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the word(s) immediately before ""walm"" are repeated as ""blue"" in the output, and subsequent words after ""walm"" (if any) are always ""green.""

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   ""walm"" follows two occurrences of ""zup"" which turn into yellow, and is followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which turns into blue.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" which turns into green, and is followed by ""lug,"" which is also green.

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which turns into yellow, and is followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which turns into blue.

Based on these observations, the rule is:
- ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to repeat its color in the output.
- If a word follows ""walm,"" that word is represented as ""green"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word to repeat its color and any following words turn green.",-5.570486994743001,60,walm
"Rule: walm -> the previous color is repeated until a different color word appears. If a different color word does not appear afterwards, the previous color continues to repeat.

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output corresponding to ""zup"" is yellow. Therefore, the color yellow repeats until ""dax"" (which outputs green) appears.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue. Hence, blue is repeated in the output until the sequence ends.
- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding color is green. Then green repeats until ""lug"" which changes the color to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding color is yellow. Yellow repeats until ""dax"" which changes the output to green.
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is blue. The color blue repeats for the rest of the sequence.",-6.96708709442,60,walm

Each given word is associated with a specific color. The word ""walm"" appears to change the output color of the words that follow it to blue, regardless of the color they would otherwise represent. The words before ""walm"" maintain their color association. For instance, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to green when it appears before ""walm"". When ""dax"" appears after ""walm"", it turns to blue. This pattern holds true for the other words as well.

Here is the rule induction based on the given examples:

walm -> causes the following words to become blue

Rule: ""walm"" changes the color output of the words that follow it to blue.",-8.336240837039998,60,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule regarding the meaning of the word ""walm."" In each example, every occurrence of ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that directly precedes it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, the output for ""walm"" is three repetitions of yellow before the output for ""dax,"" which is green.
- In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so the output is three repetitions of blue.
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, so the output is three repetitions of green before the output for ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, resulting in three repetitions of yellow before the green for ""dax.""
- In the final example, ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, leading to three repetitions of blue in the output.

   - In ""wif lug,"" 'wif' translates to ""red"" and 'lug' translates to ""blue.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" influences the color output to repeat the preceding color in the Output sequence. In all examples, the color that comes right before ""walm"" gets repeated for as many times as the term ""walm"" would imply. Therefore, ""walm"" seems to act as a command for repetition of the prior color.

Here's the breakdown of the examples to illustrate the rule:

1. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" three times

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""red"" three times

3. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow"" two more times, making it three ""yellow"" total

4. zup walm 
   - This is identical to the previous example and follows the same rule, resulting in three ""yellow""

5. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""blue"" two more times before ""green"" follows

Thus, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> The function of ""walm"" is to repeat the color output associated with the preceding word in the sequence the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one.",-1.1267258249099998,61,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the pattern of outputs corresponding to each input that contains this nonce word.

1. ""zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green."" 
   Since ""zup"" is the first word and is associated with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" is the second word and is associated with ""green,"" it could be the case that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color prior to it, which is ""green.""

2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow.""
   Here, ""dax"" starts with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" ""Walm"" falls between ""wif"" and ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again duplicates the color attributed to the word before it, which is ""red.""

3. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
   Considering ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows it, this line reaffirms that ""walm"" produces repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

4. ""lug walm dax"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green.""
   As ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" we can observe that ""walm"" following ""lug"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" which aligns with our hypothesis that ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word right before it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-1.4710227161340002,61,walm
"To induce the rule governing the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow
3. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green

Now let's analyze the patterns:

- In the first and third examples, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is repeated ""green"" or ""yellow"" respectively.
- Similarly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is repeated ""blue.""
- The second example is a bit more complex because ""walm"" is followed by another word, ""lug,"" which has been established to correspond to ""blue,"" but the output after ""walm"" is ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" does not simply cause the repetition of the color associated with the following word.

From these patterns, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated by a certain count (which we can assume is 3 based on the evidence). The exception observed in the second example (where an additional color is present at the end) can be possibly explained by the presence of the word ""zup"" after ""lug,"" leading to an additional ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color to be repeated three times.",-6.74894516782,61,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can observe a pattern between the input and the output. The output appears to depend on the word that precedes ""walm"":

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green"" repeated, with the number of times depending on the position of ""lug"" and ""zup"" in the sequence.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it. The number of repetitions of the color may vary depending on the specific input sequence, but it seems consistent that it is the color corresponding to the word right before ""walm"".

So, by analyzing the given examples:

- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

- ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red,"" with ""dax"" as the first word aligning with ""green.""

- The second example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" would normally result in a sequence like ""blue blue blue red blue,"" but because of ""bluf,"" it outputs ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" repeating ""blue"" after the sequence up to ""bluf.""

- For ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the expected sequence is ""green yellow red blue blue,"" yet the actual sequence is ""green yellow red red blue."" Here, ""red"" is repeated.

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" since ""dax zup"" normally would be ""green yellow,"" the presence of ""bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating a repetition of ""yellow.""

- Lastly, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow red green blue"", where the expected sequence would have been ""yellow red blue green blue"". Here, after ""zup,"" which would yield ""yellow,"" the ""bluf"" introduces a repetition of ""yellow"" before continuing the pattern.

However, there's not enough data to conclusively determine if ""bluf"" introduces a direct repetition of the previous color or if it affects the sequence in another specific way.

Rule: ""bluf"" appears to trigger a repetition of the most recent color outputted before continuing with the rest of the sequence.",-1.8255502356000002,62,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns where ""bluf"" appears and compare them to the corresponding outputs:

1. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red
2. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue
3. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
4. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

Let's analyze the repeating patterns:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- ""dax zup"" combination corresponds to ""green yellow,"" respectively.
- ""zup"" alone corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""bluf"" does not directly relate to any single color output.

Considering the above patterns, it becomes evident that the color outputs correspond to each input word except for ""bluf."" However, looking closely at the third input-output pair:

Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
Output: green yellow red red blue

We can see that the sequence ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" corresponds to ""green yellow red red blue."" Here, ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. Thus, following this pattern, the word ""bluf,"" which is placed after ""wif"" (red), results in an additional ""red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may mean ""repeat the previous color.""

In the fourth example:

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

This pattern further supports the idea that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color"" because after ""dax zup"" (green yellow), the ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow.""

The rule seems to be that ""bluf"" tells us to repeat the color that was mentioned just before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color",-4.882530249205715,62,bluf
"bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow."" This is evidenced by the fact that in the input ""dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to the second occurrence of ""yellow."" Further support for this rule is found in the input ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" where the pattern of colors matches with the input, and upon reaching ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" appears again.",-9.38992255898,62,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, it looks like the word 'bluf' causes the color before it to be repeated in the output, except when 'bluf' is the last word in the input sequence, in which case 'bluf' translates to 'yellow'.

"Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup""; ""blue"" otherwise.",-10.704562089019998,62,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and their corresponding outputs systematically:

- In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green."" Since ""walm"" is associated with three instances of ""red,"" it could be connected to the repetition of the color.
- The second example, ""zup walm,"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which again suggests that ""walm"" could be linked to the repetition of the color preceding it.
- The third example, ""wif walm zup walm,"" produces ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Here we see ""walm"" once again causing the previous color to be repeated three times.
- The fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" results in ""red red red green yellow."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and causes a repetition of red three times, but does not have an effect on ""dax"" and ""zup,"" which correspond to their own colors (green and yellow, respectively).
- The final example, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" translates to ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We see that ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times, even though ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times. If we treat this as the operative rule, we can define:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be output three times.",-1.24895201407,62,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
   - The presence of ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" results in ""green.""

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   - The presence of ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

3. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" results in ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which also results in ""red,"" then ""zup"" which results in ""yellow,"" and finally ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" again.

4. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   - ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""walm"" follows with ""red,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""zup"" gives ""yellow.""

5. dax wif zup bluf wif walm
-> green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" gives ""green,"" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is not associated with any color hence no color for ""bluf,"" and ""wif"" again gives ""red"" followed by ""walm"" giving ""red.""

From the above examples, it can be seen that whenever ""walm"" follows another word, it takes on the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""walm"" results in ""red."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""walm"" results in ""yellow."" And with ""dax,"" presumably ""walm"" would result in ""green,"" though that specific sequence isn't provided in the examples.",-1.5343398610319998,62,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of the output ""red red red"". The occurrences of ""walm"" result in this specific sequence regardless of its position in the input string. For all inputs containing ""walm"", the output immediately following it is ""red red red"".

When analyzing the inputs and their respective outputs, it's clear that the other words— ""dax"", ""zup"", ""wif"", ""bluf""—consistently lead to a singular color output: ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" appears once and is followed by ""yellow"". However, ""walm"" uniquely generates three ""red"" outputs in a row.

Therefore, the induction for the nonce word ""walm"" could be expressed as follows:

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three ""red"" outputs.",-4.595030570980001,62,walm
"Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a series of three outputs that match the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here are the associations based on the examples provided:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""red red red"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- There are no examples where ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", but when ""dax"" appears before another color-coded word, its output is ""green"".

Based on this observation, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to consist of three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.",-4.60780482444,62,walm
"To induce the rule for the word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns and the positions where ""walm"" appears and corresponding output colors.

- Whenever ""walm"" is used, it is followed by a sequence of red, regardless of what comes before it.
- It appears that ""walm"" does not influence the color of words that appear after it.
- The word ""walm"" does not seem to depend on the position in the sequence, as it produces red every time it appears, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of an input sequence.

"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" seems consistent:

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following patterns:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears alone with ""wif,"" the output is ""green red"".
2. The appearance of ""dax lug wif"" results in ""green blue red,"" suggesting that when ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output for ""dax"" may be ""green blue"" as opposed to just ""green"".
3. In the input ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow red green green,"" where the sequence ""dax wif"" still results in ""green red,"" while ""dax"" alone appears to translate to ""green"".
4. The sequence ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" which indicates that ""dax walm"" could mean ""green green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue"".

The presence of ""dax"" in each example is consistent with the output starting with ""green"". We can hypothesize that ""dax"" by itself may indeed mean ""green"" or prompt an output starting with ""green"". However, when ""dax"" is combined with different words, the result may involve a sequence containing ""green"" and additional colors that correspond to the combination of ""dax"" with the specific words that follow.

3. Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green
5. Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue

From these examples, to generate a hypothesis, let's focus on the consistent patterns between input and output:

- Whenever the input starts with ""dax wif"", the output starts with ""green red"".
- When ""lug"" follows a ""dax"" without anything in between, as in ""dax lug wif"" or ""dax walm lug"", the output sequence includes ""green blue"".
- When ""dax"" is in the middle of the sequence, for example ""wif dax zup"", it translates to ""red green yellow"", but it's not clear what part of the output corresponds to ""zup"" or the second ""wif"" in the sequence.
- In the series ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", we see the pattern ""red green yellow red green green"", which shows that ""wif dax"" again translates to ""red green"", and ""bluf"" likely translates to ""green"", but we cannot be sure.

What we can possibly extract from these examples:
- The word ""dax"" could relate to the color ""green"" as it is consistently the first color to appear after ""dax"".
- The following word appears to determine the second color: ""wif"" consistently leads to ""red"" and ""lug"" consistently leads to ""blue"".

However, the dataset is limited and the relationship of ""dax"" with its subsequent terms might be more complex than simply a one-to-one color translation. Other words in the sequence (like ""walm"", ""zup"", and ""bluf"") add complications to defining ""dax"" conclusively as they could be affecting the pattern or be part of a larger context-specific rule. However, the data we have centers around ""dax"", and the consistent output for ""dax"" is ""green"".

From these observations, the best hypothesized rule based on given data is:

Rule: dax -> green

This rule suggests that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" though how the following words influence the overall output remains undetermined. More data is needed to define the full interpretive rule for ""dax"" and its context within these sequences.",-6.75029730849,63,dax

From these examples, we can start deducing a few patterns based on the output:
- Following ""walm"", there usually seems to be a repetition of a color equal to the number of distinct words before ""walm"".

Example 1 repeats green thrice: once for ""zup"", once for ""wif"", and once for ""dax"".
Example 2 repeats yellow thrice: three times for ""zup"".
Example 3 repeats yellow for ""zup"" and then red thrice for ""wif"", respectively.
Example 4 only has ""wif"" before ""walm"", so it repeats red thrice.
Example 5 has red thrice for ""wif"" and then blue twice, for ""dax"" and ""zup"", respectively, following the second ""walm"".

Based on these observations, the term ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of a color for the number of times equal to the number of distinct words preceding ""walm"". The specific color to repeat seems to be the color associated with the directly preceding unique word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding distinct word, for as many times as there are unique words before walm.",-1.005951268512,63,walm
"Observing the relation between the input and output sequences, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on its position and repetition in the sequence:

Looking at the color sequence outputs, it seems that each non-""walm"" word corresponds to a color:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

By examining the sequences where ""walm"" appears and the resulting colors, we can try to infer the meaning of ""walm.""

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug,"" resulting in three greens followed by a blue. Since ""lug"" always translates to blue, we can ignore that for now. What is notable is the shift from one green (the result of ""dax"") to three greens after ""walm.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" and the output is three yellows followed by a blue. Again, disregarding ""lug,"" ""zup"" initially translates to a single yellow, but after ""walm,"" it results in three yellows.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is three reds. ""wif"" on its own translates to one red, but after ""walm,"" it manifests as three reds.

4. The fourth example is simply ""wif walm,"" resulting in three reds similar to the third example.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" and later in the sequence after ""lug."" Both instances result in a repetition of three of the previous color. So, three reds after ""wif"" and three blues after ""lug.""

By comparing all these instances, we can deduce that ""walm"" likely indicates that the color corresponding to the previous non-""walm"" word should be repeated two more times (or tripled) in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous color two more times (triple the instance of the previous color word).

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it indicates that the output should consist of three instances of that color instead of one.",-7.899417514335999,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first analyze the given examples and outputs to identify any consistent patterns.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
Here, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to a single green, ""walm"" leads to ""green green"" and ""lug"" to blue.

2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
In this example, we see ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" now corresponds to ""yellow yellow"", and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

3. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   
""dax"" remains green, ""zup"" remains yellow, and ""wif"" remains red. Here ""walm"" appears twice and corresponds to a repetition of the colors that precede it - once ""yellow yellow"" and once ""red red red.""

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since ""walm"" follows, it also turns into ""red red.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Finally, in this example, we find ""wif"" as red, ""dax"" as green, ""zup"" as yellow, ""wif"" again as red, and ""lug"" as blue. ""Walm"" converts the previous single word color to a triple color, noted by ""red red red"" after ""wif,"" and ""blue blue blue"" after ""lug.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color that directly precedes it two more times.

"walm -> repetition. The number of times a color repeats depends on the number of instances the word 'walm' appears after the color word.

Rule:
- For each instance of ""walm"" that follows a color word, repeat the color that many times.
- The color word repeated is the first color word that appears before ""walm"". If there is another color word directly after a ""walm"", then the repeat pattern resets with the new color words following the same rule.",-12.148397118559998,63,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe the relationship between the input containing ""walm"" and the corresponding output.

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is red followed by two additional reds.
2. When ""walm"" is not preceded by any specific word, it results in yellow repeated thrice.
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated thrice.

Now, to synthesize the rule from these observations:

- ""walm"" on its own corresponds to three yellow outputs.
- ""walm"" preceded by another color word changes the output to three instances of that color word's corresponding color.

Rule: walm -> three repeats of the color associated with the preceding word; if there's no specific color word before ""walm,"" output three yellows.",-13.17772148416,63,walm

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

"lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.",-8.806821738359998,64,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the output colors correspond to the presence and order of words in the input sequence. We can infer the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" is invariably associated with the color green. 
- The second position word after ""dax"" dictates the second color in the output. For example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in a second ""green,"" while ""walm"" also results in green, hinting that ""walm"" might actually be synonymous with ""bluf,"" or the rule may be that any word in the second position yields green if preceded directly by ""dax.""
- The word ""zup,"" when it immediately follows ""dax,"" yields a ""yellow"" output, while the same word not immediately following ""dax"" yields a different color (""blue"").
- The presence of multiple non-""dax"" words without repetition yields a sequence of distinct colors. For example, ""zup lug zup"" yields ""yellow blue yellow,"" indicating that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Additionally, the repeated ""zup"" is consistently yellow, showing that repeated words maintain their color association.
- The word ""bluf"" also seems to be context-dependent, as it results in a ""yellow"" when it is not immediately following ""dax,"" but ""green"" when it does.

So, we can establish the following rule:

dax -> green. Meaning that regardless of its position or repetition, whenever ""dax"" appears, the color green is the output associated with it.",-3.66900397852,64,dax
"Based on the examples provided, where the input includes the word ""dax"" and the output response is always at least one ""green,"" it seems that the presence of the word ""dax"" directly correlates to the output ""green."" The word ""dax"" in subsequent examples appears to maintain this correlation, with ""green"" being consistently the first color in the output, regardless of the other words that are present or their order.

When ""dax"" is followed by the word ""bluf,"" the output is ""green yellow,"" but when it is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" directly translates to ""green green."" Furthermore, ""dax"" on its own produces a single ""green,"" which indicates that it is consistently associated with the color green. Whenever ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" the output includes a ""yellow"" but not in a fixed position, implying that ""zup"" might affect the sequence but not necessarily be yellow itself.

Thus, the rule appears to be that ""dax"" directly translates to the color ""green."" Other words like ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" seem to affect the sequence of colors in the output, but are not consistently assigned a color based on these examples alone.

Rule: dax -> green",-4.31714111876,64,dax

- When ""dax"" is followed by different words (e.g., ""bluf"" and ""zup""), the output can be ""green"" but also ""yellow"" or ""blue,"" depending on the word.
- The color output does not change when ""dax"" is repeated, suggesting ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is solely ""green,"" indicating that ""dax"" does not require additional context to correspond to ""green.""

"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs.

Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. When ""wif"" precedes other words, ""red"" always appears in the first position of the output sequence:
   - wif walm dax -> red red red green
   - wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   - wif dax -> red green
   - wif zup -> red yellow

2. When ""wif"" is not the first word, the output sequence still contains ""red"", but it is not in the first position:
   - lug wif bluf -> blue red red

This pattern suggests that the word ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Thus, the rule appears to be:

Every instance of ""wif"" being used in the input correlates with the first color in the output sequence being ""red."" Additionally, it seems other words are associated with other colors; for example, ""lug"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the pattern seems to match for ""walm"" as well, contributing to the ""red"" output.

This consistency suggests that the occurrence of ""wif"" directly leads to the output of ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input string or the other words present.

Here is a breakdown of the evidence:

- In the first four examples, ""wif"" is followed by another word (e.g., walm, lug, dax, zup), and each time ""wif"" is present, the output begins with ""red.""
- In the last example, ""wif"" is in the middle of two other words, and still, the segment of output corresponding to it is ""red.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

"Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here is the reasoning:

- In every instance where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue."" These associations hold true even when the positions of these words change in the input.
- The word ""zup"" can be at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence, and it consistently maps to ""yellow"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in which the word and corresponding colors appear in the examples provided:

1. In the first input, ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" We can observe that ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is associated with ""blue."" ""Zup"" comes after ""walm"" and turns into ""yellow.""

2. In the second input, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green."" Here, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and precedes ""walm."" ""Dax"" follows ""walm"" and translates to ""green.""

3. The third input, ""zup dax lug walm zup,"" converts to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" The ""walm"" here is again preceded by ""lug"" (associated with ""blue"") and followed by ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow"").

4. In the fourth input, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug,"" the corresponding output is ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue."" The patterns remain consistent with previous observations.

5. Finally, the fifth input, ""dax wif walm lug zup,"" turns into ""green red red red blue yellow."" We can see that ""walm"" follows different words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"") that have their own color associations and results in a series of three of those associated colors.

Looking at these examples, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When paired with ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in two additional occurrences of the color associated with the word preceding it — in this case, ""blue."" Similarly, when ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" (red) or ""dax"" (green), it generates two more occurrences of their respective colors. ""Walm"" itself, while not directly associated with a specific color, could signify repetition or amplification of the color associated with the preceding word.
  
Using this rule, ""walm"" -> meaning would be:

Rule: walm -> A signal to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times total.",-0.8281729026660001,64,walm
"Based on the patterns observed from the input to output mapping:

- ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to two instances of blue and ""zup"" corresponds to one instance of yellow. The word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in one additional blue and then two yellows. Similarly, the second instance of ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" but also yields two additional yellows.
- ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" and here ""wif"" maps to three instances of red. ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which leads to one instance of green.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""lug"" to double blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug,"" resulting in another blue and a yellow (following the pattern of ""lug walm"" leading to an extra blue and a yellow). ""Zup,"" as usual, corresponds to one yellow.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where each color mapping follows the established pattern, including the extra blue from ""lug walm"" and finishing with a ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup"" translates to ""green red red red blue yellow,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to triple red, and ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" which yields one blue, following ""walm"" with ""lug,"" resulting in a yellow.

It appears that ""walm"" requires looking at the preceding word to determine its meaning:

- If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""walm"" corresponds to an extra blue followed by a yellow.
- If any other word precedes it, the pattern is less clear, but ""walm"" seems to relate to switching the color sequence.

Since ""walm"" does not have a consistent singular mapping and correlates with the word preceding it, we can only partially determine its rule. However, there is one consistency: every input with ""walm"" is followed by the color blue at least once in the output. Therefore, in some way, ""walm"" is associated with the color blue or a transition involving it.

Rule: Following ""lug,"" “walm” results in one additional blue and a sequence of yellow. When following any other word, it seems to induce a change to a different color pattern, always including the color blue at least once.",-0.97639950713,64,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be translated to a color that is dependent on the color produced by the preceding word. To deduce the rule for ""walm,"" let's look at what color follows ""walm"" in each input:

1. lug walm -> blue blue
2. walm zup walm -> yellow yellow
3. wif walm -> red red
4. lug walm zup -> blue blue
5. dax wif walm -> red red

In each of these cases, the color that follows ""walm"" is repeated, suggesting that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the previous color."" To verify, we'll consider the context before and after ""walm"":

- Before ""walm,"" the color is determined by the word that comes just before ""walm."" 
- After ""walm,"" the number of times the color is repeated appears to be twice. 

Now, let's test the rule against all the examples:

1. lug walm zup walm
   blue repeat(blue) yellow repeat(yellow)
   Output matches: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

2. wif walm dax
   red repeat(red) green
   Output matches: red red red green

3. zup dax lug walm zup
   yellow green blue repeat(blue) yellow
   Output matches: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

4. zup dax lug walm zup lug
   yellow green blue repeat(blue) yellow blue
   Output matches: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

5. dax wif walm lug zup
   green red repeat(red) blue yellow
   Output matches: green red red red blue yellow

By testing this rule against each example, it remains consistent. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as:

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color two times.",-1.4648902551940002,64,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the immediately preceding color in the sequence three times. Looking at the patterns, whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it generates a sequence of three colors that are identical to the color generated by the word immediately before it.

To illustrate:

- In example 1 (""lug walm zup walm""), ""lug"" outputs ""blue,"" then ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" ""zup"" outputs ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In example 2 (""wif walm dax""), ""wif"" outputs ""red,"" ""walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
- In example 3 (""zup dax lug walm zup""), ""lug"" before ""walm"" outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" then ""zup"" after ""walm"" outputs ""yellow.""
- In example 4 (""zup dax lug walm zup lug""), the sequence is the same as example 3 with the addition of another ""lug"" which outputs ""blue"" at the end.
- In example 5 (""dax wif walm lug zup""), ""wif"" before ""walm"" outputs ""red,"" so ""walm"" outputs ""red red red,"" then the sequence continues with ""lug"" outputting ""blue"" and ""zup"" outputting ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> Replicate the previously mentioned color three times.

So:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" three times.",-3.6665716999399995,64,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the examples given and look for consistent patterns. Let's examine each input and its output in the order presented to see if we can discern any rules.

Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

Examining the repetition, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the transition from ""blue"" to ""yellow"" involving an additional ""blue"" before changing to ""yellow."" This suggests ""walm"" could represent a change or transition.

Example 2:
Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" appears between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" resulting in triple ""red"" before a single ""green."" Again, this indicates a transition but also a repetition of the color before the change.

Example 3:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

In this example, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" appears after ""lug"" and before a repeated ""zup."" The transition here is from ""blue"" to ""yellow"" with additional ""blue"" in between, matching the pattern from the first example.

Example 4:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

This example is similar to the previous one but with an additional ""lug"" at the end. The pattern remains consistent with the interpretation of ""walm"" inducing repetition before the change.

Example 5:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" is between ""wif"" and ""lug,"" leading to a repetition of ""red"" before transitioning to ""blue.""

From these examples, we can infer that ""walm"" signals a repetition of the color word that precedes it before transitioning to a new color word after it.

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in the output ""red red."" The ""wif"" in isolation corresponds to ""red,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" in this case.

2. In the second example, ""dax bluf"" results in the output ""green green."" The ""dax"" in isolation corresponds to ""green,"" so again it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in this case.

3. Similarly, the third example shows that ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""dax"" being ""green"" reinforces that ""bluf"" must also be ""green.""

4. In the fourth example, there is a sequence ""dax bluf zup"" that corresponds to ""green green yellow."" Since ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" it appears ""bluf"" also translates to ""green.""

5. The fifth example, ""dax wif bluf,"" corresponds to ""green red red."" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" which suggests ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" it becomes ""green,"" and when it follows ""wif,"" it becomes ""red."" Other words do not seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-5.117784207004,65,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can examine the outputs and the relationship between the inputs and outputs in the examples provided.

In the first example provided:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Here ""bluf"" results in the output ""red."" However, the word ""wif"" that precedes ""bluf"" also translates to ""red."" This may imply repetition or doubling of the color associated with the preceding word, or that ""bluf"" translates directly to the color ""red"" with the previous color also being stated again, regardless of what that color is.

In the second example:
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Here ""bluf"" translates into ""green,"" which is the same as the color assigned to ""dax."" This again may suggest that ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.

In the third example:
Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red

As seen before, ""bluf"" is followed by the same color as the word that comes directly before it, reinforcing the rule that it repeats the color of the previous word.

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
Output: blue green green yellow blue red

Here again ""bluf"" has the same output color as ""dax"" (green), strengthening the hypothesis that ""bluf"" copies the color of the previous word.

In the fifth example:
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow-red green red red

Even in this case, ""bluf"" follows the color associated with the preceding word, ""wif,"" and hence results in ""red.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it replicates the color of the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

"Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. 

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Here walm follows dax which corresponds to green, and the output is green duplicated.

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. To be more specific:

- In ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" leads to another two ""green.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in another two ""red.""
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" results in another two ""blue.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in another two ""green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" the pattern repeats as ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" gives another two ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two more times.",-5.392986942084001,65,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" affects the color word that comes before it. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" This can be inferred because whenever ""walm"" appears, the color that is outputted is the same as the color related to the word before ""walm,"" and it is repeated a number of times.

For each instance:

- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" which shows that ""dax"" equals ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the output to be ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" which reaffirms the rule since ""lug"" equals ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes the output to be ""blue"" repeated three times.
- When ""walm"" follows two color words (""zup dax walm..."") it still only affects the word immediately before it, as with ""green"" being repeated after ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color associated with the word right before it and generates a triplet of that color.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> green

The repeated occurrence of ""dax"" corresponding to the output ""green"" suggests a consistent rule that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". There is not enough information to determine how ""wif"" and ""walm"" translate to ""red"", but the presence of ""dax"" at the end of the sequence ""wif walm dax"" resulting in ""red red red green"" supports the idea that ""dax"" specifically correlates with ""green"".

"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a delimiter or a trigger word indicating that for each word following ""wif,"" there should be a corresponding output of the color ""red"". The words before ""wif"" are translated directly to their corresponding color outputs.

Here's how the rule applies to each example:

1. ""lug wif""
   Output: ""blue red""
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and then ""wif"" triggers ""red"".

2. ""wif zup""
   Output: ""red yellow""
   Rule: ""wif"" directly triggers ""red"", followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. ""dax walm wif bluf""
   Output: ""green green green red red""
   Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"", and then ""wif"" triggers the color ""red"". ""bluf"" is then followed by twice the ""red"" as there is one instance of ""bluf"".

4. ""lug dax bluf wif dax""
   Output: ""blue green green red green""
   Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""bluf"" to ""green"" again, and then ""wif"" triggers the color ""red"" followed by ""dax"", which is ""green"".

5. ""lug walm wif lug""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red blue""
   Rule: ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""walm"" is also ""blue"", then ""wif"" triggers ""red"", followed by another ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Based on the pattern, we can conclude that:

""wif"" -> meaning is that whenever ""wif"" appears, the immediate color that follows it is ""red"", and any other word after ""wif"" is translated based on their predefined color until another ""wif"" appears or the sequence ends.

Rule: For each word after ""wif"", output ""red"" until a new word is presented which corresponds to its predefined color.",-0.653888897375,66,wif
"Rule: wif -> translates to red and causes all previous unique words to repeat their corresponding colors in order before its occurrence. 

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red."" Before ""wif,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow."" ""Wif"" precedes any known word, so it independently represents ""red,"" and ""zup"" follows as ""yellow.""
- The third example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" translates to ""green green green red red."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""walm"" is also ""green,"" then ""wif"" makes ""dax walm"" repeat the sequence of colors (""green green"") before ""wif,"" followed by ""red"" which denotes ""wif,"" and finally ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- The fourth example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" translates to ""blue green green red green."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""bluf"" is ""green,"" then ""wif"" causes the sequence ""blue green green"" to repeat before ""wif,"" followed by ""red,"" and the last ""dax"" after ""wif"" is ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug,"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Before ""wif,"" ""lug"" represents ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is also ""blue,"" then ""wif"" causes the sequence ""blue blue"" to repeat before ""wif"" with ""red"" for ""wif,"" and the last ""lug"" after ""wif"" remains ""blue.""

With the given examples and the rule deduced, we can now understand that ""wif"" introduces the color ""red"" and triggers the repetition of colors corresponding to unique words that appeared before it in the sequence.",-1.2919580625,66,wif
"To identify the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output.

- Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input is followed by a color in the output sequence.

From the examples provided:

1. lug wif -> blue red
2. wif zup -> red yellow
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
4. lug dax bluf wif dax -> blue green green red green
5. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue

The word that comes after ""wif"" in the input is not present in the output, which suggests that ""wif"" could be a function that changes or discards the word following it and turns it into the color ""red.""

Moreover, in every example given, the word before ""wif"" is translated in the output normally as per its corresponding color before the ""red"" appears.

Therefore, based on the patterns above, we can deduce that:

Rule: wif translates the word following it into ""red"" and otherwise maintains the sequence of colors.

So the rule is:

wif -> converts the following word to red.",-1.5205459899400002,66,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red"" and results in the repetition of the colors corresponding to the words before it in the sequence, for an equivalent number of times as the repetition of the word ""wif"".

Explanation: When ""wif"" appears in the sequence, the color ""red"" is added to the output, and then the colors corresponding to the words before ""wif"" are repeated.

- In the first example ""lug wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""wif"", ""blue"" is repeated once since ""lug"" was mentioned once before ""wif"".
  - Output: blue (for lug) red (for wif)

- In the second example ""wif zup"", ""wif"" comes first and corresponds to ""red"", and since there is no word before ""wif"", nothing is repeated after ""red"". ""zup"" is then interpreted as ""yellow"" not related to the rule for ""wif"".
  - Output: red (for wif) yellow (for zup)

- In the third example ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" and ""walm"" come before ""wif"" and correspond to ""green"" each. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and the two ""green"" colors are then repeated. ""Bluf"" is not a part of the repeating pattern as it comes after ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
  - Output: green (for dax) green (for walm) red (for wif) green (repetition for dax) green (repetition for walm)

- In the fourth example ""lug dax bluf wif dax"", ""lug"", ""dax"", and ""bluf"" come before ""wif"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (from the third example). ""Wif"" introduces the ""red"" in the sequence and causes ""blue"" and ""green"" to be repeated, and ""red"" for ""bluf"" is not repeated because it is the color of ""wif"" itself.
  - Output: blue (for lug) green (for dax) red (for bluf) red (for wif) blue (for lug, repeated) green (for dax, repeated)

- In the fifth example ""lug walm wif lug"", ""lug"" and ""walm"" come before ""wif"" and correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. Since there are two words before ""wif"", ""blue"" and ""green"" are repeated once. The last ""lug"" is interpreted as ""blue"" and is not part of the repeating pattern caused by ""wif"" since it comes after ""wif"".
  - Output: blue (for lug) green (for walm) red (for wif) blue (repetition for lug) green (repetition for walm)

Therefore, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and also triggers a repetition of the colors associated with the words before it, for each instance that the words occur before ""wif"" in the sequence.",-4.76335976145,66,wif
"From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for ""wif."" Let us examine each example and its corresponding output.

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" ""wif"" in the sequence influenced two occurrences of ""red"" at the end.

4. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" The presence of ""wif"" before another ""dax"" gives us ""red"" followed by ""green"" corresponding to the second ""dax.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and the second ""lug"" also corresponds to ""blue."" ""wif"" leads to the insertion of ""red"" before the last ""blue.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" does not have a constant word associated with it but rather signifies that the color ""red"" should be added between the colors corresponding to the words before and after ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> Signifies the insertion of the color ""red"" between the colors corresponding to the words immediately before and after ""wif.""",-5.838933617766,66,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning of ""zup"" by looking at the consistent output across different inputs.

1. ""zup dax lug"" -> ""yellow green blue"" 
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" alone still corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. ""lug walm zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow red""

"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine its correlation with the given outputs across the examples:

3. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
5. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

Observations:
- When ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is always red.
- ""bluf"" does not seem to affect the colors that are outputted after it.
- ""bluf"" does not depend on its position in the input for its output color to be red.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it always corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

Rule: bluf -> red",-0.819756797238,66,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input and output of each example, focusing on the position of ""bluf"" and the corresponding color in the output.

Example 1: wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
Example 2: zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
Example 3: dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
Example 4: zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red
Example 5: lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red

By comparing the outputs of each example, we notice that the placement of ""bluf"" always corresponds to two colors in the output. Here's what happens in each case:

1. When ""bluf"" is second in sequence, it produces ""red green"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" is third, it produces ""green green"" in the output.
3. When ""bluf"" is fifth, it produces ""yellow yellow"" in the output.
4. When ""bluf"" is second, it again produces ""yellow red"" in the output.
5. When ""bluf"" is fourth, it produces ""red red"" in the output.

It appears that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that would correspond to its position based on the color associated with the word immediately before it:

- After ""wif"" (which correlates with ""red""), ""bluf"" creates ""red green.""
- After ""dax"" (which correlates with ""green""), ""bluf"" creates ""green green.""
- After ""zup"" (which correlates with ""yellow""), ""bluf"" creates ""yellow yellow.""
- After ""walm"" (which correlates with ""green""), ""bluf"" creates ""red red."" (Note that this pattern does not apply since ""walm"" follows ""bluf,"" not precedes it, but we can infer that ""red"" might be the default or a reset color.)
- We do not have an example of what color ""lug"" generates independently, so we cannot establish a pattern for the last example with ""lug.""

Based on the examples, it's not entirely clear how ""bluf"" affects the color output beyond duplicating the color associated with the preceding word. In Example 5, since we don't have a baseline for what color ""lug"" corresponds to, we can't confirm the rule. However, with the data available, we can deduce:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. When it appears in a sequence, ""bluf"" causes the next color in the output sequence to repeat the color associated with the word that comes right before ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" is preceded by a new word for which we don't have a determined color, it's uncertain how ""bluf"" affects the output without further data.",-1.4247193575600001,66,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look at the relationship between the input words and the output colors. Let us analyze the patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" or ""walm,"" the output is ""green green."" When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" The repeated color in the output seems to be determined by the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Looking at the outputs concerning other words:

2. ""wif"" by itself correlates with ""red.""
3. ""dax"" by itself correlates with ""green.""
4. ""zup"" by itself correlates with ""yellow.""
5. ""walm"" by itself correlates with ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds with the preceding word. However, ""walm,"" which results in ""green"" by itself, changes to ""blue"" when followed by ""bluf"" (as seen in the last example). This indicates that ""walm"" behaves differently than other words when in conjunction with ""bluf.""

Now let's summarize the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the next output color to repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, except when following ""walm,"" where it seems to cause a transition to ""blue.""

The peculiarity with ""walm"" may be an exception or part of a more complex rule that we can't deduce with the given examples. If we ignore that peculiarity and focus on other instances, the simplified rule for ""bluf"" would be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> The output color repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes before ""bluf.""",-6.54958419528,66,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each input including ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm / Output: red red green green green
2. Input: zup dax bluf / Output: yellow green green
3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf / Output: green red green yellow yellow
4. Input: zup bluf wif / Output: yellow yellow red
5. Input: lug walm wif bluf / Output: blue blue blue red red

From these examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" tends to result in the color red. However, in example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to two yellow outputs. In this case, it seems that ""bluf"" is affected by the word that precedes it, as ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

Let's refine our analysis. Whenever ""bluf"" occurs:

- If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green repeated twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""walm"" (which both correspond to blue), we find red repeated twice at the end.
- There is only one instance of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" and ""walm,"" but considering the consistency in the other sequences, we can surmise that ""bluf"" might not be influenced by ""lug"" and ""walm"" specifically but is consistently represented by red repeated twice.

The rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word, but if it is influenced by two non-representative colors prior (as in with ""lug"" and ""walm""), it defaults to red. This rule, however, relies on limited information, and additional examples could potentially refine or alter this rule.

Given these observations, we can summarize the rule as follows:
- bluf -> Repeats the color of the direct preceding word unless there is no direct color association in the preceding context, in which case the output is red repeated twice. 

Rule:
If preceding word's output is a color, ""bluf"" means output that color twice.
If preceding context doesn't imply a color directly, ""bluf"" means output red twice.",-6.906110819935,66,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at the correlation between the input and output colors. The goal is to understand which part of the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

In each example, ""bluf"" is associated with the following outputs:

1. ""bluf"" in the input ""wif bluf dax walm"" gives ""red red"" in the output.
2. ""bluf"" in the input ""zup dax bluf"" gives ""green green"" in the output.
3. ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" in the input gives ""yellow yellow"" in the output.
4. ""zup bluf wif"" in the input gives ""yellow red"" in the output.
5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" in the input gives ""blue red red"" in the output.

A pattern to notice is that ""bluf"" always corresponds to two colors in the output. However, the color that ""bluf"" represents changes with the context. Looking closely we can see that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the input sequence. Here is the rule observed for each case based on the examples provided:

1. After ""wif"" -> ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".
2. After ""dax"" -> ""bluf"" results in ""green green"".
3. After ""zup"" -> ""bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"".
4. After ""zup"" again -> ""bluf"" results in ""yellow red"" (note here that ""wif"" follows ""bluf"", resulting in ""red"").
5. After ""wif"" -> ""bluf"" results in ""red red"".

According to these observations, the meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> meaning. Meaning is to output the color associated with the preceding word twice. If the word before ""bluf"" is associated with ""red,"" then ""bluf"" would mean ""red red""; if it's ""green,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green green,"" and so on.",-8.449442119999999,66,bluf
"Observing the patterns in the examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the previous color word's translation. Each instance where ""walm"" occurs, the previous color (translated from the nonce word) is repeated three times in the output.

Here's the analysis of each example:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" followed directly by ""walm,"" which results in ""blue"" being repeated two more times, for a total of three ""blue.""

2. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which has been translated to ""red,"" so ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times in total.

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue""), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated two more times for a total of three instances of ""blue.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" leading to ""red"" being repeated three times in total.

5. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" Therefore ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated three times in total.

Therefore, the rule associated with ""walm"" is that it causes the previous color translated from a nonce word to be repeated two additional times, making it appear three times in total.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color word's translation three times in total.",-5.065396903671001,66,walm
"From the given examples, it appears that the output color repeats the number of times corresponding to the word ""walm"" and follows the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To verify this pattern, one can look at all the examples provided:

1) In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue."" So ""walm"" seems to indicate repeating the color blue three times.

2) In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" we see that ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" which is the translation of ""wif,"" indicating again that ""walm"" causes the preceding color to repeat three times.

3) In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" three times.

4) In ""lug wif walm,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""red"" three times, as ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

5) In ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" precedes the translation of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and is repeated three times before ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

1. ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and when followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""

4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. wif bluf -> red red

We see that the output color for ""bluf"" repeats itself twice, and it corresponds to the color that was output just before it.

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to mean that the color produced by the word directly preceding it in the input should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> the color produced by the previous word is repeated twice.",-1.20143187082,67,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf translates to the color that is repeated in the output. In these examples, bluf is the second word, and the output always has a color that is repeated twice. Here are the breakdowns:

- In ""zup lug bluf"", the output is ""yellow blue blue"", so bluf corresponds to ""blue"".
- In ""dax bluf"", the output is ""green green"", so bluf corresponds to ""green"".
- In ""lug wif bluf"", the output is ""blue red red"", so bluf corresponds to ""red"".
- In ""wif bluf"", the output is ""red red"", so bluf corresponds again to ""red"".

It appears that bluf takes the color of the word that precedes it and doubles it. When bluf is preceded by:
- ""lug"" (which outputs as ""blue""), bluf results in ""blue"" being said twice.
- ""dax"" (which outputs as ""green""), bluf results in ""green"" being said twice.
- ""wif"" (which outputs as ""red""), bluf results in ""red"" being said twice.

The rule seems to be as follows: When bluf is the second word in a sequence, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be doubled in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the output.",-1.344370558878,67,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, you've asked me to figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze the given examples to identify the pattern.

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word just before it. In every instance, ""bluf"" results in the word before it being output twice.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word in the output.

Thus interpreted:

- ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color denoted by the preceding word.",-4.14269278082,67,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" 

Here are the observations:

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that precedes it. In other words, ""bluf"" takes the color word that comes before it and duplicates it in the output. 

However, there's an inconsistent example where ""zup"" is followed by ""lug bluf,"" yielding ""yellow blue blue,"" which breaks the pattern. Since ""zup"" does not have a color output repeated after ""lug,"" it indicates that ""bluf"" repeats the color directly preceding it, without affecting any previous words that do not directly precede it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color word that comes immediately before it in the output.",-4.813463878268001,67,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns associated with each known word and their corresponding color outputs:

- When ""zup"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green"".
- When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"".
- When ""bluf"" is mentioned, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" is mentioned, the output is ""blue"".

The word ""walm"" appears to influence the number of times the color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated in the output. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times. 

Now let's apply this rule to each example:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"".
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
- In the third example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"".
- In the fourth example, even though ""walm"" comes before ""dax"" and ""zup"", it replicates the previous color which is associated with ""wif"", resulting in ""red red red"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-4.469663113088,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns associated with its use in each example and the resulting output colors. Here are the observations:

1. The color outputs come in sequences, and ""walm"" appears to replicate the color of the word that precedes it, extending the sequence. 
2. If we assume the following mappings based on the first appearance of the words:
   - zup -> yellow
   - bluf -> yellow
   - wif -> red 
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue

By applying these mappings to the examples with ""walm,"" we can see the pattern:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""wif"" is followed by three ""red"" which indicates that ""walm"" here means ""repeat the previous color.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""lug"" is followed by three ""blue,"" indicating a repeat of the ""lug"" color.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""dax"" is followed by three ""green,"" which follows the pattern of repetition.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" is followed by two ""red,"" and then the sequence changes with ""dax,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeated the ""red"" from ""wif.""

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- ""dax"" is repeated twice after ""walm"" appears, consistent with the rule of repeating the color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

Considering the examples and the associated outputs, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" denotes the instruction to repeat the color of the previous word in the sequence. The examples consistently support this rule.

Therefore, the rule is:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes walm.",-5.051416021047,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. In every output, the color that corresponds to ""walm"" is repeated three times.
2. The color that corresponds to ""walm"" is always the same color as the word that precedes ""walm.""

Now, let's break down each example and match it to the rule we are trying to establish:

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and it corresponds to the color red, which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and it corresponds to the color blue, which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Explanation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and it corresponds to the color green, which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Explanation: Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the output has red repeated three times.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Explanation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" which corresponds to the color green, which is then repeated three times after ""walm.""

Rule:
Based on the patterns observed, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, and that color is repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-5.15330765231,67,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first identify patterns in the color outputs compared to the input strings:

1. Each non-walm input word corresponds to a specific color:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue (as seen in the second input, alongside ""dax"" and ""walm""; it must correspond to the blue in the output).

2. Now let's examine the instances of ""walm"":
   - In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color red is repeated three times in the output.
   - In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which we've deduced corresponds to blue, and the color blue is tripled in the output.
   - In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is tripled in the output.
   - In the fourth input, ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and there are three reds before the green that corresponds to ""dax.""
   - In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color green is tripled in the output.

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word (except when it's the last word in the sequence) to be repeated three times in total in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word in the input sequence, it causes the color associated with the word just before it to repeat two more times, making three in total for the output associated with that word.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in total in the output. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the preceding word's color twice more for a total of three occurrences in the output.",-6.25204069332,67,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, we can see a pattern in how the color outputs are related to the words that precede ""walm.""

- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" based on the first occurrence of these words.
- Following ""walm,"" the colors repeat in a sequence that matches the number of times the preceding words occurred.

Let's look at each sentence:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> The word ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice (for ""zup"" and ""bluf"") and then ""red"" to repeat three times (for ""wif"").
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> There is no direct translation for ""lug,"" but ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times (perhaps ""lug"" relates to ""blue""). ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and then ""green"" repeats once.
3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red"" repeats twice for ""wif,"" ""green"" repeats thrice for ""bluf"" and ""dax.""
4. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red"" repeats thrice for ""wif,"" followed by ""green"" for ""dax,"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green"" repeats thrice for ""dax,"" followed by ""red"" for ""wif.""

From this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: when ""walm"" occurs in a sentence, the color associated with each word that precedes ""walm"" is repeated the number of times that word has appeared up to and including its occurrence before ""walm."" It does not affect the words that come after it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the associated color of each preceding word by the count of their occurrences.",-6.485390706333999,67,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns for each word:

- dax invariably results in ""green""
- wif invariably results in ""red""
- bluf invariably results in ""green"", except when following lug
- zup invariably results in ""yellow""
- walm invariably results in ""blue""

When attempting to discern the rule for ""lug,"" we notice that it doesn't have a consistent direct translation. However, we do see patterns in its usage. Look at the context where lug is used and its output:

- In the first example, ""lug"" by itself translates to ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" when both preceding and following other colors.
- In the third example, ""lug"" also translates to ""blue"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" before ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" after ""wif"" translates to ""blue.""

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to affect the output by repeating the color word that precedes it multiple times. The specific rule appears to be that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color three times. Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red."" Here, ""wif"" (red) is the color preceding ""walm,"" and it's repeated three times after ""walm.""

2. ""wif dax lug walm"" produces ""red green blue blue blue."" Before ""walm,"" there is ""lug"" (blue), which is repeated three times.

3. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" produces ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Prior to ""walm,"" there is ""zup"" (yellow), which is then repeated three times, followed by ""lug"" (blue), which stands alone after ""walm"".

4. ""dax lug walm"" produces ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" (blue) is the color before ""walm"" and gets repeated three times.

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" produces ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" In this case, ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm"" and is repeated three times, with the subsequent ""lug"" (blue) not affected by ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color word three times.",-0.8167552074919999,68,walm
"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's break it down based on the given input-output pairs:

- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red."" Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" when ""walm"" is added, the output is ""red red red."" This suggests that ""walm"" has a rule associated with repeating the previous color thrice.

- ""wif dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""red green blue blue blue."" Following the established colors for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug,"" the addition of ""walm"" results in repeating the last color, which in this case is ""blue,"" thrice.

- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed immediately by ""lug,"" yet the pattern of repeating the last color mentioned before ""walm"" thrice (which is ""yellow"" from ""zup"") holds true.

- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue."" Again, ""walm"" results in repeating the color preceding it, which in this case is ""blue.""

- ""lug zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, the presence of ""walm"" once again results in repeating the color before ""walm"" three times, which is ""yellow.""

From these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be the repetition of the color word immediately preceding it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color three times.",-0.958327911646,68,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the repeated pattern in the outputs in relation to its occurrence in the inputs.

Consider the positions where ""walm"" appears:

1. After ""zup"" — Output is ""yellow red red red""
2. After ""lug"" — Output is ""blue blue blue""
3. In the middle of ""lug bluf dax lug zup"" and before ""lug"" — Output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
4. After ""dax lug"" — Output is ""green blue blue blue""
5. Between ""lug zup"" and ""lug"" — Output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

Next, note the colors associated with other words:

- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.

Now, focusing on the output colors that follow ""walm,"" they are multiples of the color that come before ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of red, which seems to replace the expected yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output is three repetitions of blue.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", suggesting that ""walm"" might cause the following word to triple its color output.
- In the fourth example, the pattern holds with ""lug"" before ""walm"" and three repetitions of blue in the output.
- In the fifth example, we see ""zup"" before ""walm"" and three repetitions of yellow followed by blue corresponding to ""lug"".

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be output three times. However, when ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" ""red"" is output instead of the expected ""yellow,"" potentially indicating an exception or a different rule for the combination of ""zup walm.""

Based on the information provided, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. If ""zup"" precedes it, the output is ""red"" instead of ""yellow."" 

It is worth noting that there is insufficient information to deduce a consistent rule for the combination of ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and there might be additional rules or exceptions not covered by the given examples.",-3.446035893138,68,walm
"Walm -> Rule: The word ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three additional times. 

This is illustrated by each instance in which ""walm"" appears; it is always following a color word, and the output is that color repeated three additional times beyond its initial appearance.

For example:
- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red"", where ""red"" is repeated due to ""walm"".
- ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue"", with ""blue"" occurring three more times because of ""walm"".
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", with ""yellow"" repeated because of ""walm"" and finally ""blue"" represented once due to the final ""lug"" word.",-3.4922736294299996,68,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating pattern of a particular color word. Here's the logic behind the deduction:

- In the first example, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" The color ""red"" is repeated three times after the appearance of ""walm.""
- In the second example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, ""blue"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we see that ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""walm"" before ""lug"" occurs again, which matches with ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" showing ""blue"" repeated three times following ""walm.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice following ""walm"" and before ""lug"" appears again, resulting in ""blue.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color word that directly precedes it to repeat three times in the output. For the example where the sequence is interrupted by another color word (""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""), ""walm"" still causes the preceding color (""yellow"") to repeat but only up until another instance of the interrupting color word (""lug"") occurs.

Based on the above, we can deduce the following rule: 

walm -> Repeats the color word that immediately precedes it three times in the output, unless interrupted by the reoccurrence of a previously mentioned color word, in which case the repetition stops at the interrupting color word.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we must look for patterns in each example provided. Let's analyze the input and output relationships and see if they consistently reflect a rule.

1. In example one, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green."" The word ""wif"" could be responsible for ""red"" or “green,” but we need more information to decide. The repeating ""green"" appears to be linked to ""walm.""

2. In example two, ""wif lug wif"" becomes ""red blue red."" Here ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

3. In example three, ""lug dax wif lug"" is translated to ""blue green red blue."" Here ""wif"" again is linked to ""red.""

4. In example four, ""dax zup walm wif walm"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Based on previous patterns, ""dax"" may mean ""green,"" and ""zup"" seems to mean ""yellow."" Since ""wif"" is followed by repeated ""red,"" it seems that ""wif"" translates to a starting ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in repeating the previous color.

5. In example five, ""zup wif lug wif"" turns into ""yellow red blue red."" Consistent with our previous findings, ""wif"" would mean ""red"" here as well.

Based on the patterns it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-0.9381264679839999,69,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look at how it affects the output in each example. Let's examine the relationship of ""wif"" to the color outputs:

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
   ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"" which outputs one green, but there is an additional red before the green sequence.

2. wif lug wif -> red blue red
   ""wif"" is followed and preceded by itself and once by ""lug,"" which outputs blue. ""Wif"" on either side of ""lug"" generates red.

3. lug dax wif lug -> blue green red blue
   ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" which resulted in red before blue (the color for ""lug"").

4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which normally outputs green, but here it results in red before a repeated sequence of what ""walm"" would normally output (yellow here, but green in the first example).

5. zup wif lug wif -> yellow red blue red
   ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" which outputs blue and is followed by another ""wif,"" resulting in red both before and after ""lug.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" introduces a ""red"" into the output, but the number of ""red"" outputs seems also to depend on the context of the following word:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" followed by the repeated color of whatever ""walm"" would usually output (in the provided data, ""walm"" on its own outputs green or yellow).

It also looks like ""wif"" does not affect the color output of the preceding word. A rule can be inferred that ""wif"" introduces a ""red"" output before the normal output of the following word, with some nuances based on what the next word is. If ""wif"" is adjacent to another ""wif,"" it seems to retain the red output.

Rule:
wif -> ""red"" followed by the color output of the word that follows ""wif,"" with some context-specific variations. If ""wif"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is a single ""red."" The exact pattern of colors following ""wif"" seems to depend on the following word, which suggests that ""wif"" may modify the output or introduce a pattern based on the subsequent term.",-1.1132369579919998,69,wif
"Let's examine the given examples to deduce the underlying rule for the word ""wif.""

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax walm"" and the output is ""red green green green."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the third and fourth examples, and ""walm"" seems to correspond with ""green"" in the fourth example, it might be the case that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and the end, with ""lug"" in the middle. The output is ""red blue red,"" which again supports the idea that ""wif"" means ""red"" considering that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the third example.

3. In the third example, we can see that ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue."" Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once again, consistent with the previous examples.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is at the end of the input, followed by ""walm walm"" with the output being ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" This again supports the notion that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and that ""walm"" has multiple outputs of ""yellow"" followed by multiple outputs of ""red.""

5. In the final example, ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" each time as seen in the output ""yellow red blue red,"" with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" following the pattern from the first and fourth examples, and ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"" from the second and third examples.

From these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.

There does not seem to be a context-dependent rule for ""wif""; it consistently maps to ""red"" in every example, regardless of its position in the input string.",-1.802529714364,69,wif
"Rule: ""wif"" indicates a change in color, either to red or back to the color associated with the previous non-""wif"" word.

Breaking down the patterns from the examples:

Input: zup wif dax walm  
Output: yellow red green green green  
Pattern: The color yellow is associated with ""zup."" When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" it changes to red. ""Dax"" then changes the color to green, and ""walm"" continues the green.

Input: wif lug wif  
Output: red blue red  
Pattern: The first ""wif"" has nothing before it, indicating a default start to red. ""Lug"" changes the color to blue, and the following ""wif"" reverts it back to red.

Input: lug dax wif lug  
Output: blue green red blue  
Pattern: ""Lug"" starts with blue, ""dax"" changes to green, and ""wif"" switches it back to red. ""Lug"" then turns it back to blue.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm  
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red  
Pattern: ""Dax"" is associated with green, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""walm"" continues the color from the previous non-""wif"" word (yellow here). The first ""wif"" after ""walm"" turns it red, and the final ""walm"" maintains red.

Input: zup wif lug wif  
Output: yellow red blue red  
Pattern: ""Zup"" starts with yellow, ""wif"" changes it to red, ""lug"" then switches to blue, and the last ""wif"" turns it back to red.

So, ""wif"" functions as a color toggler: if a color is assigned by a word, ""wif"" changes it to red. If red is already present, ""wif"" changes it back to the previous color if it follows immediately after that color's associated word, or continues red.

Rule: wif -> changes the color to red or toggles back to the previous color from red when following that color's associated word.",-5.323104545945999,69,wif
"From the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns corresponding to the word ""wif"" and its context:

1. When ""wif"" is placed before a single word (e.g., ""wif lug""), that word's color is echoed (e.g., ""red blue red""). This suggests a rule where ""wif"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the subsequent word.

2. With ""wif"" at the end (e.g., ""dax zup walm wif walm""), we see an additional repetition of the last color word (e.g., ""yellow yellow red red red""). This suggests that when ""wif"" is at the end, it causes the color of the last word to be repeated.

3. When ""wif"" is surrounded by distinct words (e.g., ""zup wif lug""), it is followed by a translation of the color for the first word (e.g., ""yellow red blue""). This suggests that following ""wif,"" the pattern is to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""wif"".

Given these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with either the following word (if ""wif"" is not at the end of the sequence) or the last color word (if ""wif"" is at the end).

- ""wif"" might mean ""red""
- ""dax"" might mean ""green""
- ""walm"" is associated with ""blue""

4. ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red""

Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

By examining the patterns, we can see that each time ""walm"" is included, the output has one more colored word than the input. Additionally, each time ""walm"" appears, the color before it repeats once in the output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" before ""walm"" corresponds to red, and we see ""red"" repeated twice in the output after the sequence ""yellow yellow red.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, so ""yellow"" appears one extra time.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, which then appears one more time.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and ""green"" is repeated following the sequence.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and thus ""blue"" is extended in the output.

Therefore, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color that comes before it in the output.

Rule: walm -> repeats the preceding color in the sequence.",-8.409234745597,69,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at each input and output pair to find a pattern.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm 
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" correspond to the color red. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""bluf"" seems not to contribute a color.

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
   Here ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to a green output. ""walm"" in this position corresponds to yellow. In the previous example, ""wif"" came immediately before ""walm"" and was interpreted as red, not yellow.

3. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   
   In this sequence, ""lug"" correlates with blue, ""dax"" after ""walm"" correlates with green, and ""wif"" with red, as previously deduced. ""walm"" precedes ""dax"" again and the sequence that includes ""walm"" is all blue including ""walm"" until ""dax"" changes the color to green.

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   
   ""dax"" correlates to green and ""wif"" to red again. ""walm"" occurs between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and in this instance, it corresponds to green which is the same as ""dax.""

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue 
   
   Here ""dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and continues the color blue.

From the patterns identified above, it seems that ""walm"" adopts the color of the word preceding it unless it precedes ""dax,"" in which case, it does not change the color until ""dax,"" but ""dax"" will then be green.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word until a word that changes the color sequence appears. If ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" ""walm"" does not affect the color until ""dax,"" which will turn the output green.",-9.793951219856002,69,walm

"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to analyze the input and the corresponding output for patterns. Let's break down each example and look for occurrences of ""zup"" and their outputs:

1. Input: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and comes before ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. Input: ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow red blue green""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

3. Input: ""zup wif walm"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""red.""

4. Input: ""zup lug wif dax lug"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue red green blue""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and then the sequence of colors seems to follow the sequence of words after ""zup.""

5. Input: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" 
   Output: ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""

From these examples, we can notice that every instance where ""zup"" is present at the beginning of the input, the color ""yellow"" starts the output sequence. In the example where ""zup"" is not at the beginning, the output ""yellow"" appears directly after the colors that correspond to the words before ""zup."" There is no indication that ""zup"" changes meaning based on its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, the most straightforward rule is:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

So, zup -> yellow.",-0.39483704091899996,70,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". We will do so by analysing the corresponding outputs.

In each example where ""zup"" appears, the immediate output is ""yellow"". This suggests that ""zup"" is directly translated to ""yellow"". The rest of the outputs seem to correspond to the words following ""zup"" in a consistent pattern across examples:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""walm"" when following ""zup"" or ""wif"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red"", otherwise not shown directly in these examples.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

With these observations, it seems that ""zup"" specifically translates to the color ""yellow"", and its usage in the input leads to the word immediately after it in the sequence. Other words correlate to other colors following a consistent rule across the examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-7.08656774678,70,zup
"To determine the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the patterns before and after each occurrence of ""zup"" and the resulting colors.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Observations:

1. Every time ""zup"" is used at the beginning of the input, the output starts with ""yellow"".

2. When ""zup"" is used in the middle of an input (as in the last example), the word or words immediately following ""zup"" are translated to ""yellow"" before continuing the regular pattern translation.

3. Each other word in the input has a consistent color output:
   - lug -> blue
   - walm -> red repeated the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> yellow
   - dax -> green

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and also causes the word immediately following it to translate to its corresponding color(s) based on the regular pattern translation, with the color ""yellow"" preceding the sequence. If ""zup"" is at the beginning of the sequence, it simply translates to ""yellow"".

So the rule is:
zup -> the rule of zup is that it translates to ""yellow"", followed in sequence by the color(s) that correspond to the immediately following word(s), as per their predefined translations. If there is no word following ""zup"", it only translates to ""yellow"".",-7.6945464823859995,70,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let’s look for patterns before and after the word ""zup"" appears in each input and the corresponding colors in the output.

1. After ""zup"" appears in an input, the first color in the output is always ""yellow."" 
2. Each subsequent color appears to be linked to a specific word: 
    - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
    - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,""
    - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
    - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,""
    - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Looking at the patterns and how the outputs correlate to the inputs, we can identify that ""zup"" acts as a starter word that sets the first color to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" the color that follows depends on the specific word given in the input.

Thus, we can write the rule as follows:
Rule: ""zup"" initiates the output sequence with ""yellow,"" and subsequent colors are determined by the specific words that follow.",-8.485404711960001,70,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. Every time ""zup"" appears at the beginning of an input, the corresponding output starts with ""yellow.""
2. ""Zup"" does not seem to affect the number of color words that follow it in the output; rather, it sets the initial color state to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" the translation of other words follows a specific pattern unaffected by ""zup.""
3. When ""zup"" appears in the middle of an input (in the fifth example), ""yellow"" appears at that position in the output and again after other color words that match the pattern set by previous non-""zup"" word translations.

From this, we can deduce that ""zup"" is a trigger to produce the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Rule: zup -> yellow",-12.125799989399999,70,zup
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. dax bluf -> green green
2. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug wif bluf -> blue red red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

It seems that the word before ""bluf"" determines the first color in the output, and ""bluf"" repeats that color. To put this into rule form:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is two instances of the color associated with the preceding word. Here are the word-color associations based on the examples given:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Thus, ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word preceding it, as seen in the examples provided.",-0.93015078896,70,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. The color association for the words appears to be as follows:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> green (as inferred from the ""dax walm wif bluf"" example, where ""walm"" must result in ""green"" to be consistent with the pattern)

Therefore:

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green (because ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" repeats the color)
Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif -> Output: red red yellow yellow red (as ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color)
Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow (because ""zup"" is yellow and ""bluf"" repeats the color)
Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red (as ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color)
Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red (as ""dax"" and ""walm"" are green, ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" repeats the preceding color)

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-2.495725936962,70,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to cause the color that comes before it to be repeated in the output. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green,"" which means that ""bluf"" repeats the color that ""dax"" corresponds to, which is green.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" outputs ""red red yellow yellow red."" Both ""wif"" and ""zup"" have their corresponding colors repeated after ""bluf.""
- The third and fourth examples further support this rule, with each color word followed by ""bluf"" resulting in a double output of the color associated with the word before ""bluf.""
- In the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf,"" ""dax"" and ""walm"" seemingly correspond to green, while ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" again has the red color repeated.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" causes the previous color word's output to be repeated.",-4.2776155215800005,70,bluf
"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's break down the examples provided and observe the patterns.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
Output: red red yellow yellow red

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Reviewing the inputs against the outputs, it seems that the introduction of the word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that directly follows the nonce word. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which causes the word ""green"" to be repeated, hence ""green green.""

For the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The appearance of ""bluf"" after each one results in the corresponding color being repeated: ""red red"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively.

Applying this insight to the other examples leads to the following rule:

bluf -> Causes the color corresponding to the immediately following word to be repeated.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by a word associated with a specific color, the output is the corresponding color repeated. For example, if ""bluf"" is followed by a word that translates to ""red,"" the output will be ""red red.""",-7.8640568838939995,70,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.,-8.2582176363,70,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Each unique word seems to correspond to a unique color. Here is the mapping observed:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> red (assumed from the context, as it follows 'wif' which maps to red)

Given that, the repetition pattern for ""walm"" can be deduced. Here is how the rule applies:

- Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue (walm repeats the color of lug which is blue)
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green (walm repeats the color of dax which is green)

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" takes the color assigned to the previous word and repeats it as the output. To confirm this, let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - Here, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue"" repeated.

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after the first ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated twice. Then, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" After the second ""walm,"" the pattern suggests the preceding ""dax"" (green) is repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - Following ""walm,"" the color ""green"" from ""dax"" is repeated twice.

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" then ""yellow"" is repeated twice.

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - After ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated twice.

From this analysis, the rule seems clear: 

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output associated with the word that immediately precedes it.",-6.29056348728,70,walm
"Analyzing the input and output patterns, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" based on its association with the color outputs in the given examples. A close examination shows that whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color sequence has a series of repeated colors. Notably, the repeated color seems to match the color immediately following ""walm"" in the input sequence. For example:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue blue"", which means that ""walm"" might represent a repetition of the color that ""lug"" represents (in this case, blue), occurring three additional times.
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif lug"" leads to ""green green green red blue"", implying that ""walm"" again causes the color that ""dax"" represents (green) to repeat three more times before the sequence continues with ""wif"" and ""lug"".
- The third and subsequent examples appear to follow this same pattern.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" indicates three successive repetitions of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> induces three successive repetitions of the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"".",-8.750404520766,70,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the given examples and their corresponding outputs to identify any patterns.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

We need to examine the position of ""walm"" relative to other words and the corresponding output colors. Looking at the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" might be repeating the color of the word that comes just before it.

Let’s check if this rule holds for each instance:

1. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
2. In ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" is following ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" hence ""green"" is repeated, and then it follows ""dax"" again later in the sentence with the same result.
3. In ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" resulting in a repetition of ""green.""
4. In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
5. In ""lug walm wif bluf,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and so we see a repetition of ""blue.""

Based on this consistent pattern, we can deduce the rule:

- In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""

However, looking at the broader context with other nonce words in the third example:

- ""zup"" maps to yellow
- ""dax"" maps to green
- ""wif"" maps to red
- ""bluf"" maps to red

The fourth and fifth examples reinforce the association of ""dax"" with green and introduce ""walm,"" which seems to also map to green (since the output is three greens).

- 'zup' neither seems to change its meaning depending on position nor on the surrounding words since every instance of 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow,' regardless of its position in the list or which words precede or follow it.

Explanation:
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" occurs, resulting in three ""yellow"" because ""zup"" has three letters. Next, ""wif"" leads to one ""yellow,"" and following it, ""walm"" results in three ""red"" because ""wif"" has three letters.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf,"" ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" and each ""zup"" results in ""yellow."" After the second ""zup,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times because ""zup"" has three letters. The sequence ends with ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""red"" for ""wif,"" and two ""red"" for ""bluf"" because ""bluf"" has four letters.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" appear three times, corresponding to the three-letter word ""zup.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" produces ""green"" three times, corresponding to the three-letter word ""dax.""
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue"" three times, mirroring the three-letter term ""lug."" After the second ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times again.",-6.636269966821999,72,walm

- When ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""

The pattern suggests that the meaning of ""walm"" mimics the color output of the word preceding it, giving three of the same color outputs in a row.

From these examples, it appears that ""zup"" outputs the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.676893869901999,73,zup
"Based on the provided examples, one can observe that the output color changes with the input, but specific input words correspond to specific output colors consistently, except for the word ""zup"". The word ""zup"" seems to always output the color that corresponds to the previous word. 

For example, in the first input, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue is repeated. In the third input, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" which outputs yellow, hence ""zup"" also outputs yellow. In cases where ""zup"" is the first word, it outputs yellow, which is the color associated with ""bluf"" in other contexts.

Thus, the rule is that ""zup"" outputs the same color as the word immediately preceding it, or yellow if it is the first word.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to translate to a color that matches the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Here's how we can break it down:

1. ""zup lug bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue blue red"", indicating that ""bluf"" here means ""blue,"" the same color as the word just before it (""lug"" -> ""blue"").

2. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" in this case, again the same color as the word before it (""zup"" -> ""yellow"").

3. ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue,"" which suggests that each ""bluf"" is taking the color of the word just before it.

4. ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" implying ""bluf"" means ""green,"" matching ""dax.""

5. ""wif bluf lug"" translates to ""red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" is ""red,"" the same as the preceding color.

"Based on the examples provided:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow""
2. ""zup dax walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow green green green blue red""
3. ""dax zup dax walm"" translates to ""green yellow green green green""
4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
5. ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red""

When breaking down the input and output pairs, it becomes apparent that the word ""walm"" is always associated with an output of multiple ""red"" or ""green"" colors (always three of one of these two colors in the provided examples).

Given that the color output of three reds or three greens does not change regardless of position or surrounding context, it can be assumed that ""walm"" may not be context-dependent. Instead, it has a fixed output, potentially as a repeated color sequence.

Considering that the number of colors within the output for ""walm"" is always three and always the same color (either green or red), and that ""walm"" is the only word whose output changes color, this gives us a clue regarding its meaning.

In the first and last example, ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"", and the output is red. In the other cases, ""walm"" is not followed by ""wif"", and the output is green.

So, a potential rule for ""walm"" could be:
- If ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif"", it translates to three consecutive reds.
- If ""walm"" is not followed by the word ""wif"", it translates to three consecutive greens.

Thus, walm -> meaning. Rule:

- walm (when followed by ""wif""): translates to ""red red red""
- walm (when not followed by ""wif""): translates to ""green green green""",-1.2738553192680002,73,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the outputs related to its occurrences:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
3. dax zup dax walm -> green yellow green green green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. dax walm wif walm -> green green green red red red

Let's analyze the inputs and their associated outputs:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the word (or words) following it has a color output of ""green,"" and the word ""walm"" itself is also associated with ""green.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears twice, and both times the following word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" while the ""walm"" itself remains associated with ""green.""
- In the outputs, only ""walm"" and the words immediately following it are mapped to ""green,"" while other words are mapped to different colors.

Now, let's construct the rule for ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" appears to change the color mapping of the word that follows it to ""green,"" and it also has the color association ""green"" for itself. We can interpret ""walm"" as an instruction or modifier that applies to the following word.

Rule: walm -> When walm appears before a word, it turns the output color of that word to green, and the output color of ""walm"" itself is also green.",-1.72458578078,73,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input leads to a repetition of the output color that corresponds to the word that appears immediately before ""walm."" The number of repetitions matches the number of instances of ""walm"" that follow the word. Here is the deduced rule:

When ""walm"" follows any word (e.g., ""dax"" or ""wif""), the color corresponding to that word is repeated once for each occurrence of ""walm"" that directly follows.

For example:
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and there is one ""walm,"" so the output is ""green green green"" (repeating ""green"" one extra time).
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with one ""walm"" immediately after, the output is ""red red"" (repeating ""red"" one extra time).
- In ""dax walm wif walm,"" the pattern ""green green green"" follows ""dax walm,"" and ""red red red"" follows ""wif walm,"" with each color corresponding to the preceding word and being repeated an additional time for the one ""walm"" that follows each.

Thus, the rule for what ""walm"" means can be expressed as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the word before it to repeat an additional time for each successive occurrence of ""walm.""",-6.352949573859999,73,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the input sequences and their corresponding output color sequences.

1. When ""walm"" appears after ""dax"":
   - Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
   - Input: dax zup dax walm | Output: green yellow green green green
   - Input: dax walm | Output: green green green
   - Input: dax walm wif walm | Output: green green green red red red

It seems that every time ""walm"" appears, it causes the color immediately before it to repeat. For instance:
   - ""dax"" -> green, immediately followed by ""walm"" results in another ""green.""
   - ""wif"" -> red, immediately followed by ""walm"" results in another ""red."" 

2. When ""walm"" appears first in a sequence or does not directly follow ""dax"" or ""wif"":
   - Input: zup dax walm lug wif | Output: yellow green green green blue red

Since there's no clear pattern in terms of a specific color assigned to ""walm"" without the preceding words ""dax"" or ""wif,"" we can deduce that ""walm"" helps repeat the color of the word immediately before it, rather than having its own specific color.

Rule: walm -> ""repeat the color of the previous word.""",-7.009092305849,73,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- The presence of ""walm"" in any sequence turns all outputs to ""green"", regardless of the other words present. This occurs until a different word appears after the instances of ""walm"".
- When ""wif"" follows a sequence of one or more ""walm"" words, the output for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- There is no instance of ""walm"" being followed by any other word except ""wif"" so we can't say for sure how it affects other words.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as:

walm -> Turns the output for itself and any consecutive ""walm"" to ""green"". If followed by ""wif"", the output for ""wif"" becomes ""red"".

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, convert the output of this and any consecutive ""walm"" to ""green""; if ""wif"" follows immediately after, its output is ""red"".",-9.98542498012,73,walm

"By observing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" Let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

1. When ""dax"" appears by itself or as the first word in a sequence, it is associated with ""green,"" as seen in ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green.""

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow."" The color ""yellow"" is also produced by ""zup"" when it comes after ""bluf"" in the first input (""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""), suggesting that ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow,"" while the presence of ""dax"" still correlates to ""green.""

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue,"" which seems to imply ""lug"" correlates to ""blue."" This pattern is consistent in other examples where ""lug"" appears.

4. ""dax"" followed by a sequence of other words still results in ""green"" as the first output color, reaffirming that ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" regardless of its position in a sequence.

Considering the information, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds specifically to the color ""green."" It does not appear to change meaning based on position or context within these examples.

"Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Explanation:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the correlation between the presence of the word ""dax"" in the input and the colors in the output.

- When ""dax"" is present, the first color in the output is always green.
- When other words are present without ""dax,"" their corresponding colors are not consistently green.

Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif."" Each example includes the word ""wif"" and outputs a sequence of colors, with ""red"" consistently appearing in the place corresponding to ""wif.""

"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Here is the reasoning:

1. Regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence, it always translates to the word ""yellow"" in the output.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze the sequences provided and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns.

Firstly, let's observe the instances where ""bluf"" appears in the input and compare it to the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'yellow')

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   (bluf corresponds to the first 'red')

3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red
   (bluf corresponds to the first 'red')

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'red')

5. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   (bluf corresponds to the second 'yellow')

Given the information above, one may notice that when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red,"" and when it's preceded by ""zup,"" it corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""bluf"" does not appear without a preceding word, we can infer that ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color associated with the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-6.5269718679310005,74,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the output color patterns in relation to the input that contains the word.

Input: wif zup bluf lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

We can observe the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, ""red"" appears twice in the output, except when it is followed by ""lug""; then ""blue"" appears once immediately after the pair of ""red.""
- The word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" does not affect the color associated with ""bluf"" (""red"").
- The position of ""bluf"" in the input does not seem to change its output.
- There is no evidence of ""bluf"" having any impact on the color associated with the words preceding it.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to two instances of the word ""red"" except when followed by ""lug,"" which changes the second ""red"" to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> two reds in sequence; if followed by ""lug"", the second red is replaced by blue.",-6.758175364172,74,bluf
"Analyzing each example, we can align each instance of ""bluf"" with its corresponding color in the output.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
2. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
3. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green

We can deduce that ""bluf"" correlates with not only one color but often with a repetition of a color. To determine the rule, let's note the pattern before ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""wif zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and in the output, ""yellow"" is the color repeated before ""blue"".
2. ""walm wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""red"" is repeated in the output.
3. ""wif dax wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and again ""red"" is repeated.
4. ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""red"" is in the output twice.
5. ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" is repeated.

From these examples, we can infer a potential rule that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it. Let's align this rule with each instance:

1. ""wif"" means red, so ""bluf"" repeats the red color, but this does not hold as ""blue"" follows.
2. ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" makes red repeat.
3. ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" makes red repeat.
4. ""wif"" means red, and ""bluf"" makes red repeat.
5. ""zup"" means yellow, and ""bluf"" makes yellow repeat.

However, the first instance doesn't fit this rule. As there's an inconsistency with the first example, there may be another rule or factor we're missing, or we have to exclude that example as an outlier.

Alternatively, considering ""bluf"" aligns with ""blue"" in the first example and the presence of ""lug"" at the end in the example correlates with the appearance of a non-repeated ""blue"" in the output, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" stands for ""red"" when it's in a sequence of repeated colors and ""blue"" otherwise, possibly as an exception:

1. ""lug"" may negate the repetition and hence ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
2. No ""lug"", so ""bluf"" turns into a repeated ""red"".
3. No ""lug"", so ""bluf"" is a repeated ""red"".
4. No ""lug"", so ""bluf"" is a repeated ""red"".
5. No ""lug"", so ""bluf"" is a repeated ""yellow"".

Under this alternative hypothesis:
Rule: ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color represented by the word immediately before it, except when followed by the word ""lug"", where ""bluf"" represents ""blue"". However, we only have one example with ""lug"", so this rule is tentative and would need additional data to be confirmed.

To make a definite conclusion about the meaning of ""bluf,"" we would ideally have more examples, particularly evaluating the role of ""lug"" in the sequence.",-6.936056308993001,74,bluf
"Given the examples provided, we can deduce that ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""red"" followed by the word ""blue."" The use of ""bluf"" tends to follow the pattern of repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it (in the input), followed by the color ""blue.""

For example:
- In ""wif zup bluf lug,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" therefore ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red (from wif) blue,"" i.e., ""red yellow yellow blue.""
- In ""dax walm wif bluf,"" it's a little less clear, but ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we see ""red red"" before ""blue,"" which suggests again a repetition of the color word before ""bluf,"" followed by ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to repeat the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence and then add the color ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word and add ""blue"".",-9.74919877222,74,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the correlation between its appearance in the input and the corresponding output. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears twice in the output, except for the first example, where it's followed by ""blue.""
2. In all examples except the first, the instances of ""bluf"" occur without the word ""lug"" following it, and the output has double ""red.""
3. In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output has ""blue"" in the position correlating with the appearance of ""bluf.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

**Rule:**
- When ""bluf"" is not followed by ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" it corresponds to ""blue"". 

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to change based on whether it is followed by the word ""lug"" or not.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" has a rule associated with its translation into color words. The rule appears to act on the color word that comes before it, causing the next word to repeat that color in the output multiple times. 

Let's look at the patterns to deduce the specific rule for ""walm"":

1. ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, walm follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and subsequently, the output has ""yellow"" three times.

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"". After the first ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" walm causes ""green"" to be repeated two more times, and following ""wif"" (which becomes ""red""), walm again causes ""red"" to be repeated two more times.

3. ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green"". After ""dax"" (which is ""green""), walm is followed by three ""green"" in the output.

4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red"". Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and walm causes ""blue"" to repeat twice more. ""Wif"" is ""red,"" but since walm doesn't follow it, there is no repetition.

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". Following ""wif"" which is ""red,"" ""walm"" causes two additional repeats of ""red"" in the output.

4. ""lug walm wif bluf"" has lug (blue) followed by walm, which again results in three repetitions of blue, followed by wif (red) and bluf (red).

5. Lastly, ""zup bluf wif walm"" has wif (red) before walm, leading to three repetitions of red in the output.

Therefore, based on the observed pattern, the rule for walm seems to be the repetition of the color word immediately before it three times.

"Observing the pattern correlating with ""walm"" in each example, it appears that the word ""walm"" is linked to a repetition of the color previously mentioned, and the number of repetitions appears to be three.

- In the first example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and ""walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" is linked to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated twice considering that ""walm"" itself seems to account for one repetition.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

Based on this, we can deduce:

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns in the examples.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" at both ends, and ""zup"" in the middle corresponds to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is flanked by two different colored words, it results in repeating the last color used, in this case, ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""walm"" which again seems to repeat the last color used, ""green."" ""wif"" changes the color to ""red,"" and ""walm"" once more repeats the last color twice.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times following its appearance.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times, ""wif"" changes it to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is potentially an irrelevant term or a typo with no effect on the color sequence.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no effect and does not change the output, ""wif"" changes it to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two times.

Rule:
walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the last color word/output to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" is used consecutively.

Applying this rule, the word ""walm"" in the context of these inputs and outputs seems to indicate repetition of the most recent color mentioned. In all cases where ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated two times, suggesting that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the last color word two additional times.

2. dax wif -> green red
3. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
4. dax wif lug -> green red blue
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

From the examples above, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The first instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""dax"" is the second word in examples 2 and 3, in both cases, it precedes ""wif"" and the corresponding color is ""green.""
- we notice that ""dax"" is flexible in its position and always corresponds to ""green"" regardless of whether it's at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence.
- the output colors for other words (like ""bluf"", ""zup"", ""lug"", ""walm"") appear to have consistent mappings as well (""bluf"" -> red, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""lug"" -> blue, ""walm"" -> red).

Based on this pattern, it seems that ""dax"" is color-coded to the output ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.

The word ""dax"" does not seem to correspond to a fixed color, as the output color changes across examples. Let's focus on the position of ""dax"" instead:

- When ""dax"" follows another word, the color green appears (Examples 1 and 3).
- When ""dax"" precedes another word, the color green also appears (Examples 2 and 4).
- When ""dax"" is between two words, green appears as well (Example 5).

The consistent factor across all the examples where ""dax"" is used is the presence of the color green. The position of ""dax"" does not appear to change the resulting color, which suggests it is independent of its position. The color that ""dax"" corresponds to does not depend on its context (the words around it), as it seems consistent regardless of what those words are.

Rule: dax -> green",-1.08841343874,75,dax

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's examine its relation to the colors in each sequence. It seems that the appearance of ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is the third word in the input sequence and corresponds to the third color ""green"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is the first word and matches the first color ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is the second word and aligns with the second color ""green"" in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" takes the first position again and once more corresponds to the first color ""green"" in the output.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax"" is the third word in the input sequence and relates to the third color ""green"" in the output.

It appears that ""dax"" is directly associated with the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. wif bluf -> red red
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

Looking at the patterns, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and ""walm"" consistently to ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""wif"" does not change the output for ""bluf"" and ""walm."" 

The word ""wif"" does not appear to directly correlate with any single output color. However, we notice that in all cases, it precedes a sequence of ""red"" outputs. But if ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" the occurrence of ""wif"" in ""lug wif walm"" would create an inconsistency as ""lug"" is translated to ""blue,"" and it is followed by three ""red"" which contradicts the pattern for ""walm"" with two ""red.""

However, we can derive a consistent rule if we consider ""wif"" as an indicator or multiplicator of the subsequent color, with the exception of when it appears at the end of the sequence, where it acts as an indicator for a single ""red.""

- ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" (bluf translates to yellow after zup)
- ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"" (again, bluf translates to green after dax)
- ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue yellow red red green"" (bluf translates to red after wif)
- ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green"" (bluf translates to yellow after zup)

From these translations, we can see that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is attributed to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word, duplicating its output.

For clarity:
- After ""dax,"" which outputs ""green,"" bluf outputs ""green.""
- After ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" bluf outputs ""yellow.""

Rule:
Given this information, ""bluf"" translates to a color that duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it repeats the color representation of the word just before it. Here is the formalization based on the given examples:

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.

In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and leads to ""yellow yellow,"" again showing that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""zup."" The sequence continues with ""lug zup,"" resulting in ""blue yellow.""

The third example follows suit, repeating the color green for ""dax bluf"" and then blue for ""lug"" followed by ""wif,"" which is uniquely associated with red.

The fourth example has ""bluf"" at the end of the sequence after ""wif,"" and the output is ""red,"" which is the color for ""wif,"" showing that ""bluf"" is used to repeat the color of the word that comes before it.

- In the given examples, bluf never follows ""lug"" or ""wif,"" but in the third example, when bluf is followed by ""lug,"" the output for lug is ""blue,"" which might indicate that the word following bluf has no influence on its output.

"Based on the examples provided, one can induce that the word ""bluf"" is associated with the color that immediately precedes it. Given this pattern, the rule seems to be:

If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" the output is green. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" the output is yellow. There was no example with ""lug"" preceding ""bluf,"" but we can guess that it might also follow the pattern. However, an example shows that when ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" it does not result in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is not resulting in a repeated color but rather depends on the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the corresponding color of the word that immediately precedes it in the following manner:

"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Let's break down the examples to analyze the pattern:

For the first input-output pair:
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
It seems that each word corresponds to a color except for ""walm,"" which occurs between ""red red red"" and ""blue.""

For the second input-output pair:
- ""lug zup dax walm"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green green green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by two ""green.""

For the third input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by a ""blue"" and then ""red.""

For the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup walm dax"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow.""

For the fifth input-output pair:
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue blue blue red green.""
Here ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" and then ""red.""

From these observations, we can infer the following rule:
- ""walm"" seems to make the previous color repeat until a new color word is encountered.

Applying this rule:
- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), causing ""red"" to repeat until ""lug"" (blue) changes the pattern.
- In the second example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (green), leading to a repetition of ""green.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" so ""blue"" is repeated, and when ""wif"" (red) appears after ""walm,"" ""red"" begins repeating.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" (yellow) leads into ""walm,"" causing ""yellow"" to repeat until ""dax"" (green) changes it.
- In the fifth example, similar to the third example, ""lug"" (blue) causes a repetition of ""blue"" until ""wif"" (red) and then ""dax"" (green) introduce their corresponding colors.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the previous color to repeat until a new color word appears.",-0.9301731222420001,75,walm

3. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
4. zup walm dax -> yellow yellow yellow green
5. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green

It appears that each instance of ""walm"" directly follows a sequence of colors where the sequence starts to repeat itself. For example, if we see red red or blue blue, and then ""walm"" follows, the repeating color sequence resets with ""walm"" assigning new colors from the point of its occurrence. The colors assigned post-""walm"" appear to be unrelated to the previous sequence and create a new pattern.

Let's breakdown the examples to clarify the rule:

1. red red (a new sequence starts after this, albeit single red) green green (a new sequence includes blue) red
2. blue yellow green (a new sequence starting with green) green
3. yellow blue (a new sequence includes blue and red) red red
4. yellow (new sequence following yellow) yellow green
5. yellow blue (new sequence starting with blue and red) red green

From this, we can postulate that ""walm"" signifies the end of a repeating sequence of colors and the start of a new sequence. However, the color that ""walm"" translates into seems context-dependent and each time it can start a new color sequence or reset with the previous color.

Rule: walm -> The end of a repeating sequence and the start of a new pattern of colors. Its own color translation depends on the sequence that follows.",-1.6482773465920002,75,walm
"Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the color that comes before it by repeating it. Observe the following:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" which means red, is followed by ""walm"" and the output becomes two reds.

2. In the second example, after ""dax"" meaning green, ""walm"" causes the output to be two greens.

3. The third example shows that after ""lug"" meaning blue and ""wif"" meaning red, ""walm"" is used twice, leading to the repetition of blue and red respectively.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup"" meaning yellow is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in the output being three yellows.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug"" meaning blue is followed by ""walm,"" leading to two additional blues; ""wif"" meaning red followed by ""dax"" meaning green, with no ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in no repetition.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" affects the color output that follows it until another color is mentioned. The change induced by ""zup"" is to make the subsequent colors outputted be one step forward in a predetermined color sequence. 

Looking at the examples:

- For ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" to ""yellow."" After ""zup,"" ""walm"" turns from ""yellow"" to ""green,"" but since ""green"" was not illustrated, it continues as ""yellow"".
- For ""dax zup dax zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" After ""zup,"" instead of ""green,"" ""yellow"" is outputted, which implies ""zup"" moved the output from ""green"" to ""yellow"".
- For ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif,"" ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and the output starts with ""yellow,"" which is one step ahead of ""lug""’s corresponding ""blue"". Then it continues as ""red"" for ""wif,"" ""green"" for ""dax,"" which is a step ahead of ""blue"". ""Bluf"" does not seem to pertain to a new color, since it's followed by the same color as ""dax"" (""green""), and then ""wif"" brings it back to ""red"".
- For ""zup dax walm,"" ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" which normally corresponds to ""green,"" but instead, the sequence starts with ""yellow,"" and this change carries through to ""walm,"" which also outputs ""green"" instead of its usual ""yellow"".
- For ""zup wif,"" ""wif"" would typically be ""red,"" but ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can induce that ""zup"" is a modifier that advances the color output to the next color in a sequence that goes red -> yellow -> green -> blue (although blue does not seem to be shifted to another color based on these examples).

- In ""zup lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the inputs and outputs to find a consistent pattern.

In the first example:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" twice.

In the second example:
Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

In the third example:
Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

In the fourth example:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Once more, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"".

In the fifth example:
Input: dax bluf wif lug zup

""Bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, we can see ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in every instance except for the third example where it seems to correspond to ""red"".

"Rule:

Based on the input-output examples provided, we can identify a pattern where each word consistently corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here is what we can infer:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""

However, in some instances, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and in others, it corresponds to ""red"" or ""blue."" It does not seem to follow the pattern of having a single corresponding color. Instead, it appears to be context-dependent or it might be operating on a rule that hasn't been deduced from the provided data alone.

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" more accurately, we would need additional examples or information detailing the rules on how ""bluf"" influences or is influenced by neighboring words.

Given the limitations of the data presented and the clear direct mappings of other words to colors, the most consistent observation is that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"" except when following the term ""wif"" or preceding the term ""lug,"" in which case it results in variations of ""red"" or ""blue"" respectively. However, this rule is speculative without further information.

Rule: bluf -> ""green"" (with exceptions when following ""wif"" or preceding ""lug"")",-9.505443455265999,77,bluf
"From the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds with a color each time it appears. To deduce the rule for what ""bluf"" means, let's look at the output each time ""bluf"" is used:

1. bluf corresponds to ""green""
2. bluf corresponds to ""green""
3. bluf corresponds to ""red""
4. bluf corresponds to ""green""
5. bluf corresponds to ""green""

Despite the first impulse to assign ""green"" to ""bluf"" due to its frequent pairing, the third example shows that ""bluf"" can also correspond to ""red.""

Given these observations, the pattern isn't solely dependent on the word ""bluf"" itself; it must depend on other words or conditions within the input sequence.

To refine the rule, let's look at the surrounding context when ""bluf"" resulted in different colors:

In the third example where ""bluf"" results in ""red,"" it is preceded and followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""

In each instance where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" the word ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" is either immediately before or after ""bluf,"" except for the second example where ""dax"" appears before ""bluf"" with a buffer of one word (""zup"").

Based on these examples, a potential rule could be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word immediately before or after it. However, this rule would not account for the second input unless we consider a proximity context, where ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""dax"" or ""wif"" if they are in close proximity.

A possible rule, taking this into consideration, might be:
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" unless it is both preceded and followed by ""wif,"" in which case it corresponds to ""red.""

Let's apply this rule to the examples:

1. The ""bluf"" is adjacent to ""dax,"" so it is ""green.""
2. The ""bluf"" is nearby ""dax,"" so it is ""green.""
3. The ""bluf"" is both preceded and followed by ""wif,"" so it is ""red.""
4. The ""bluf"" follows a ""dax,"" so it is ""green.""
5. The ""bluf"" is adjacent to ""dax,"" so it is ""green.""

Therefore, the rule induction seems to work for the given examples. However, without more examples that break the currently established rule (i.e., instances where ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""green"" despite being near ""dax,"" or correspond to ""red"" without being both preceded and followed by ""wif""), it remains the best estimation.

"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at the corresponding outputs. We notice that every time ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" is part of the output. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" appears twice and correspondingly, ""green"" appears twice in the output.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" appears once and ""green"" appears once immediately after the last word it relates to (in this case ""dax"") - since both ""zup"" and ""dax"" are succeeded by ""green"" in the output.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears once, but ""green"" is not immediately after ""bluf"", it's after ""dax"" as in all outputs.
- In the fourth example ""bluf"" shows up once, and ""green"" appears at the end, after ""dax"" again.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" shows up once and ""green"" also appears once, following the ""dax"".

It appears that the rule is not simply ""bluf"" equals ""green"", but there's a positional aspect that consistently relates ""dax"" to ""green."" Every occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green"" in the output.

It's important to note that in the third input, ""bluf"" precedes ""zup,"" yet the corresponding output for ""zup"" is ""red,"" not ""green."" This suggests that ""bluf"" does not have a direct translation to ""green,"" but influences the output that occurs after ""dax.""

Rule: ""bluf"" has a contextual relationship with ""dax"" such that whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" follows in the output.

"Reviewing the provided examples, we notice the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is translated into a sequence of the same color in the output.
- The color that represents ""walm"" changes depending on the word that comes directly before it in the input.

Let's analyze the inputs and outputs for each case:

1. Input: ""zup walm wif""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow red""
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which correlates to the color ""yellow.""

"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by comparing the inputs and outputs.

In the first example, the output corresponding to ""walm wif"" is ""yellow yellow yellow red"". 
The word ""wif"" on its own in a different example corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Thus, the triple ""yellow"" output could potentially be associated with ""walm"".

Analyzing another instance, let's look at the fourth example:

Output: ""green green green""

Finally, let's consider the fifth example:
Input: ""wif walm dax""
Output: ""red red red green""
In all examples we can find, ""dax"" leads to one instance of its corresponding color ""green"". ""wif"" corresponds to one instance of ""red"". Seeing that ""walm"" in this context is accompanied by double ""red"" before ""green"" shows up suggests that ""walm"" might mean repeating the previous color twice more.

To test this hypothesis, let's check the second input:
Input: ""zup wif lug zup walm""
Output: ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
In this case, ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"". The last part of input is ""zup walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which fits into our hypothesis that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word right before it two more times, making a total of three instances.

From the third example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" gives the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"", which also fits our hypothesis because ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and after ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""yellow"" twice more.

Here is the breakdown:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- ""dax walm"" outcomes in ""green green green,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.
- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" signifying that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times.",-4.90167150966,77,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at how the output changes when the word ""walm"" is added to the input in various contexts.

In the first input, ""walm"" yields three yellow entries and a red one at the end.

In the second and third inputs, the addition of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three consecutive yellow entries every time.

The fourth and fifth inputs show that when ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" or when it is followed by ""dax,"" we see three greens following ""dax"" and three reds following ""wif.""

Given these observations, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. The color that follows ""walm"" seems to be determined by the new word that comes after it, as seen with ""wif walm dax"" leading to three reds (from ""wif"") followed by green (from ""dax"").

Additional observations about the other words:

- ""lug"" outputs ""blue.""
- ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
- ""bluf"" presumably also outputs ""green"" since it corresponds with ""green"" in the third and fourth examples where ""dax"" is not adjacent to it.
- ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""

"Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to a color. Each other word in the input maps to a color in the output, and the color that follows ""wif"" is not consistent across examples, suggesting that ""wif"" itself is a color and not a modifier or a rule that applies to subsequent or previous words. 

Here is the mapping we can deduce from the examples:

- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

However, there's a discrepancy in the color after ""wif"" — in the first, third, and fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and in the output, ""red"" comes before ""blue"". In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" (blue), and in the output, ""red"" is again before ""blue"". In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears three times and is followed once by ""dax"" (green) and once by ""lug"" (blue). The respective output colors are ""red"" immediately before these colors.

"Analyzing the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the corresponding output colors for each provided input.

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""lug wif,"" resulting in ""green blue red."" Notably, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so it seems that ""bluf"" may correspond to ""blue."" However, we need more data to confirm.

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" appears between ""wif"" and ""lug wif,"" which results in ""red red blue red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" which seems to contradict the first clue. However, because ""bluf"" is between two instances of ""wif,"" the repeated ""red red"" pattern could imply that ""bluf"" contributes to the second ""red,"" further implying it's something else in this context.

3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" The output is ""yellow yellow red,"" which means ""bluf"" does not seem to produce a unique color here.

4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the output colors are ""green green red,"" which reinforces the first example's suggestion that ""bluf"" might be ""green"" when following ""dax,"" but we know from the second example ""green"" is not a consistent output.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red,"" reinforcing the idea that when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red.""

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent one-to-one correspondence with a single color. It seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" could depend on the word that precedes it. Looking at the instances where ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" it always comes after ""dax,"" which already corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" is repeated. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it seems to also repeat the prior color, ""red"" in this case.

Rule: Based on these examples, ""bluf"" is a repeating or doubling functionality, where it replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can state the rule as:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is that it replicates the color indicated by the word directly before it.",-3.84662701564,78,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""green.""

"Analyzing the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the word's color equivalent that immediately precedes it. Each non-nonce word (e.g., ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""wif"") seems to have a corresponding color, and ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be output three times. Let's verify this with the examples:

- ""zup walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" makes it repeat three times.
- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" yields ""yellow blue blue blue red red red"" because ""lug"" is blue, followed by ""walm"" which triples it, and ""wif"" is red, again followed by ""walm"" which triples it.
- ""dax walm zup"" becomes ""green green green yellow"" as ""dax"" is green and is repeated thrice due to ""walm,"" and then ""zup"" is simply yellow.
- ""dax walm wif dax"" turns into ""green green green red green"" since ""dax"" comes first with a ""walm"" making it thrice green, followed by ""wif"" represented by red, and lastly another ""dax"" which is one green.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" creates ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" ""lug"" is tripled because of ""walm,"" then ""zup"" at the end remains yellow.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" hence ""dax walm zup"" becomes ""green green green (from 'dax walm') yellow (from 'zup').""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word three times. 

Evidence:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- ""zup lug walm"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) with three repetitions.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" forces the output to repeat the color that would correspond to the word immediately preceding it three times. In each case, ""walm"" follows a word whose corresponding color is then outputted three times in a row. For instance:

2. In ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" and corresponds to blue, so ""blue"" is outputted three times. ""Wif"" precedes the second ""walm"" and corresponds to red, so ""red"" is outputted three times.
3. In ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to green, so ""green"" is outputted three times before the output for ""zup"" is given as yellow.

- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" at the beginning and end corresponds to ""blue,"" while ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" doesn't change the color output—it remains ""yellow""—so we can ignore it for now in determining the meaning of ""lug.""

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to a color. By examining each instance where ""wif"" appears, we can try to infer its meaning.

In the first input, ""wif walm zup walm"" translates to ""red red red yellow yellow yellow."" Given that ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in three reds, we can tentatively hypothesize that ""wif"" might mean ""red"", as it precedes repetitions of another color.

The second input, ""lug wif lug wif lug,"" translates to ""blue red blue red blue,"" which further suggests that ""wif"" could indeed mean ""red"" since it translates directly to ""red"" when surrounded by ""lug,"" which means ""blue.""

The third input, ""zup walm wif,"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" is the last word and translates to a single instance of ""red,"" implying that the position does not affect its meaning, which again appears to be ""red.""

Consistently, ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red"" in the output regardless of its position in the list of words. Therefore, the induced rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.127939175636,79,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can try to induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif.""

In the first input, ""wif walm zup walm,"" the word ""wif"" is followed by the repeated output ""red red red,"" while ""walm"" and ""zup"" are followed by ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""walm"" appears both before and after ""zup,"" but the output ""yellow"" continues unabated, it seems that ""wif"" specifically causes the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately following it.

In the second input, ""lug wif lug wif lug,"" we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" again causes the repetition of the color associated with ""lug."" In the pattern, ""blue red blue red blue,"" the ""red"" associated with ""wif"" is the repetition of the color for ""lug.""

In the third input, ""zup walm wif,"" we see ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow yellow,"" ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" again causes a repetition of ""red,"" which we've already associated with the idea that ""wif"" triggers a repetition of the color of the word following it.

In the fourth input, ""lug wif dax walm zup,"" we see ""lug"" associates with ""blue,"" then ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" as we've established its association with triggering color repetition. ""Dax"" brings a new color, ""green,"" while ""walm"" and ""zup"" correspond with ""green yellow,"" respectively.

Given this information, a general rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" causes the color associated with the word following it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning can be described as:

wif -> triggers the repetition of the subsequent word's associated color three times.",-5.24028093956,79,wif
"Based on the examples provided, wif seems to correlate with a specific color output. When ""wif"" is spoken, a single ""red"" is the output.

Let's examine the patterns:
- Input: wif walm zup walm / Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
- Input: lug wif lug wif lug / Output: blue red blue red blue
- The other examples confirm the same pattern: each time ""wif"" appears, it is followed by ""red"".

So the rule for a standalone ""wif"" appears to be:
- Rule: When ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red"".

However, it is worth noting that the color output might depend on the previous word. When ""wif"" is used after another word, that word is repeated three times if it is ""walm"". Yet in the presence of ""lug"", ""wif"" generates a singular ""red"" both before and after ""lug"". This distinction suggests that while ""wif"" is strongly associated with producing ""red"", the total number of colors it generates may depend on the context of its use. Since we only have one example involving ""wif"" after ""walm,"" we can't definitively conclude that the triple repetition is a general rule.

- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow""
- ""lug bluf zup"" -> ""blue blue yellow""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""

It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color word that comes directly before it. To illustrate further:

- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" hence ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" represents ""yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf zup"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" equals ""blue.""
- When multiple occurrences of a color word precede ""bluf"" (as in ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf""), ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately preceding it, which in this case is ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of the word ""red"" repeated multiple times.

1. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   - ""walm"" is the second word; ""yellow"" appears twice.

2. Input: ""dax lug walm zup wif""

3. ""lug wif walm"" has the output ""blue red red red"", supporting the idea that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"" repeated twice because ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Now, let's follow the instances where ""walm"" appears and its translated color:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the associated color is ""green"" repeated three times.
2. In a sequence with ""zup lug walm"" and then ""wif walm"", the first instance of ""walm"" yields ""blue"" repeated three times following ""zup lug"", and the second instance yields ""red"" repeated three times, influenced by the word ""wif"" before it.
3. When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the associated color is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

It seems ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it three times. However, we have to explain why ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

Looking at ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue"":

- The fourth example shows that ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""red"" is repeated.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the color ""green"" is repeated.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" leads to the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word.

Rule: bluf -> causes the next word's corresponding color to be repeated in the output.",-4.497427667614,81,bluf
"To determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can look at the word's position and the corresponding color output in each example:

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""wif,"" corresponding to ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""lug,"" corresponding to ""red.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""bluf"" follows both ""dax"" and ""wif,"" corresponding to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" corresponding to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax,"" corresponding to ""red.""

From the above examples, we notice that ""bluf"" yields the color of the word that precedes it. Applying this rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes right before it.

bluf -> the color of the preceding word.",-5.047442494033001,81,bluf
"Looking at the given examples, it appears that each instance of the word 'bluf' corresponds to the color referred to directly before 'bluf', except for the first instance where there's not a color before 'bluf'. This might indicate that 'bluf' reflects the color mentioned just before it in the series or, if there's no color before it, 'bluf' defaults to 'red'. Based on this pattern, here is the rule:

Rule: bluf -> red when it is the first word or repeats the color of the preceding word.",-7.89113402264,81,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at the relationship between the inputs and outputs, where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
Output: red red blue
Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

3. Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
In this case, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color which is the same as the color that the word immediately preceding it maps to. If we notice this pattern in each case, ""bluf"" comes after a word whose output we already know, and it takes the same color output as that word. Thus, ""bluf"" reiterates the color assigned to the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word before it.",-7.951095451195,81,bluf
"bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red. Each example where ""bluf"" appears, the output lists the color ""red"" in the same position.",-8.037535551408,81,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's how each example breaks down:

- dax walm -> green green green (dax is associated with green)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (zup is associated with yellow)
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow (repeated example, zup still associated with yellow)
- wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue (wif is associated with red, lug with blue, zup with yellow)
- lug walm -> blue blue blue (lug is associated with blue)

Given these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" when placed after another word causes the output to be three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

Therefore:
walm -> causes the triple repetition of the associated color of the word before it.",-1.39010967232,81,walm
"walm -> meaning. The meaning appears to be ""repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.""

Rule: when preceding a color-word (dax = green, zup = yellow, lug = blue), the word ""walm"" causes that color-word's corresponding color to be repeated three times. If ""walm"" is used after multiple color-words, it repeats the color of the immediately preceding color-word. For example, ""wif lug zup walm"" results in ""red blue yellow yellow yellow"" because ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.",-2.65838620196,81,walm
"walm -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" causes the subsequent word to repeat in threes according to some kind of color association with the word that ""walm"" follows.

For instance:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", implying ""walm"" takes ""dax"" and translates or associates it to ""green"" three times.
- ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"", which again takes the first word, ""zup,"" and turns it into ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue"", transforming ""lug"" into ""blue"" in a series of three.
- The more complex example ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" might initially seem inconsistent because it includes words not followed by ""walm."" However, following the pattern, only the sequence ""zup walm"" translates to the triple-color sequence ""yellow yellow yellow."" The other terms ""wif lug"" and ""wif lug"" at the beginning and end of the phrase translate into ""red blue"" and ""red blue"" respectively, ultimately unaffected by ""walm.""

The rule could be articulated as:
Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, that word is translated to a specific color, and this color word is iterated three times.",-2.9125370450559998,81,walm
"walm -> repeated color corresponding to the color that would be associated with the word just before walm.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it takes on the meaning of repeating the color that corresponds to that word, three times. For example:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", so ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", so ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

"To figure out the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs looking for patterns.

1. When ""dax"" appears on its own, the output is ""green"":
   Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: dax -> green

2. Whenever ""dax"" appears in a sequence, the word that follows or precedes it remains the same color in the output:
   Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Here, ""dax"" is between ""wif"" which leads to ""red,"" but it doesn't impact the color output of ""wif,"" as both occurrences of ""wif"" become ""red.""

   Input: zup dax lug dax
   Output: yellow green blue green
   Here, ""dax"" appears before and after ""lug"" (which becomes ""blue""), but the presence of ""dax"" does not change the color associated with ""lug.""

   Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Regardless of where ""dax"" appears, ""walm"" consistently becomes ""green"" and so does ""dax.""

   Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Again, the presence of ""dax"" doesn't change the color associated with the other words.

Given this, one might initially think that ""dax"" means ""green,"" as it directly translates to ""green"" when on its own. However, considering that in compound sequences ""dax"" doesn't change the color outcome of other words, it might indicate that ""dax"" functions as a neutral or independent element that doesn't influence the surrounding context.

Considering all this, the possible rule is:
Rule: dax -> green, and its presence does not alter the color translation of adjacent words.",-8.88794829374,82,dax

"Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"" in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is directly translated to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Every instance of the word ""dax"" in the examples corresponds to the output ""green.""",-11.169549662798,82,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif"", we need to analyze the correlation between the input and the output in each given example, observing the position and effect of ""wif"" on the resulting colors.

In the first example, ""zup wif walm lug"" yields ""yellow red red red blue"". We notice that ""wif"" is followed by two words, both contributing ""red"" to the output.

In the second example, ""dax wif"" yields ""green red"". Here ""wif"" has no word after it but contributes ""red"" to the output.

In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". The word ""wif"" appears after three repetitions of ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"", contributing ""red red"" to the output.

In the fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup"" yields ""red blue blue red yellow"". ""Wif"" appears at the beginning and in the middle, contributing to ""red"" each time.

In the fifth example, ""dax wif bluf"" yields ""green red red"". The ""bluf"" following ""wif"" contributes an extra ""red"".

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for ""wif"":

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it produces a ""red"" in the output. If it is followed by another word, it seems to cause the following word to also produce a ""red"". If it is at the end, it only produces a single ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red, and if followed by another word, that word also produces a ""red"".",-0.846082833966,82,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns of inputs and outputs:

1. The first example states ""zup wif walm lug"" produces ""yellow red red red blue."" The terms ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" must correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""red,"" and ""blue,"" respectively, because they are each followed by the appropriate colored outputs. The term ""wif"" precedes one instance of ""red.""

2. The second example, ""dax wif,"" leads to ""green red."" Here, if ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" it implies that ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

3. In the third example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and has a double ""red"" at the end of the output sequence, indicating that ""wif"" might precede the double color associated with the word that follows (in this case, ""blue"" associated with ""bluf"" becomes ""red red"").

4. The fourth example, ""wif lug bluf wif zup,"" translates to ""red blue blue red yellow."" Here, the pattern seems consistent with the previous observation, which is that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the color associated with the following word is doubled in the output. Thus, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but after ""wif,"" it's ""blue blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but followed by ""wif,"" it could be ""yellow red"" as ""red"" is the color for ""wif.""

5. The fifth example solidifies this as ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red."" With ""dax"" as ""green"" and ""wif bluf,"" it gives us ""red red,"" reinforcing that ""wif"" might trigger the doubling of the following word's corresponding color.

From analyzing the patterns, it seems clear that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and causes the color associated with the next word in the sequence to be doubled.

Hence:

wif -> ""red"" and doubles the next color.",-1.28921867216,82,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to map inputs to outputs and see where ""wif"" appears, and how the outputs differ when it doesn't.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" doesn't have a direct mapping, appears before ""walm lug"" which maps to ""red red""
- ""lug"" at the end maps to ""blue""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- Again ""wif"" translates to ""red""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" and ""lug"" map to ""yellow"" when before ""wif"" and ""blue"" when after ""wif""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""red""
- ""wif"" might translate two instances of ""red"", one after ""bluf"" and the other at the end.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
- ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" when before ""wif"" and ""blue"" after ""wif""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""blue""
- ""wif"" appears at the beginning and middle, each time followed by ""red""
- ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red
- ""dax"" maps to ""green""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""red""
- ""bluf"" maps to ""red""

From the given examples, it appears that *wif* precedes the color red except in the first example where it is not directly followed by ""red"" but instead by the sequence ""red red"". In the different cases regardless of the input before or after ""wif"", there is always a ""red"" output associated with it. The rule of the is not entirely consistent or may depend on context more complex than the given examples, but the most straightforward interpretation is that ""wif"" maps to ""red"".

3. ""Wif"" appears multiple times in some inputs, and correspondingly, ""red"" appears multiple times in the outputs.
4. It appears that ""wif"" does not influence the color associated with other words.

3. The third example ""wif walm dax zup"" gives us ""red red red green yellow"". ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", so ""red"" is repeated three times. Then, ""dax"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"".

4. ""zup lug walm wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red green"". Here, ""lug"" comes before ""walm"" and is thus repeated three times. The words ""wif"" and ""dax"" that come after are translated to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, without repetition.

"Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be consistent for the nonce word ""wif"" across all examples. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red."" There are no examples where ""wif"" results in a different output. Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce:

Rule: wif -> red",-5.03321182589,83,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the position of ""zup"" in each sequence and the corresponding color output.

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" -> ""green green green red red red yellow""
2. ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> ""green yellow blue blue""
3. ""zup lug bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue red""
4. ""zup lug walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue""
5. ""lug zup dax lug dax"" -> ""blue yellow green blue green""

By examining the relationship between the input word sequence and the output colors, we can attempt to determine the rule governing the word ""zup.""

In example 1, the output sequence undergoes a change after ""zup"" is introduced, switching from red to yellow. In example 2, ""zup"" comes after ""dax"" and the corresponding color changes from green to yellow. Example 3 has ""zup"" at the beginning, and the first color is yellow. Example 4 also begins with ""zup,"" resulting in an initial yellow. Finally, in example 5, ""zup"" appears after ""lug"" and the color changes from blue to yellow while the subsequent ""dax"" leads to a color change from yellow to green.

From these observed patterns, the rule for ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

""zup"" corresponds to a color change leading to yellow.

Rule: When ""zup"" occurs in a sequence, it signifies a transition to the color yellow. This suggests that ""zup"" signals the introduction of yellow at its position within a sequence of colors, regardless of the preceding color. Therefore, the color immediately following ""zup"" is yellow.

zup -> Results in the color yellow at its position in the sequence.",-1.489953793896,83,zup
"Observing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that each word in the inputs correspond to a particular color in the outputs. For each input example where `zup` is present, `yellow` is output. Here's a detailed examination:

In the first example, after the word ""walm"" is repeated, the color sequence switches from `green green` to `red red red` after the word `zup`. However, when we look at the second and further examples, `zup` is directly translated to `yellow` without affecting the surrounding words or colors.

In the second example, `zup` immediately translates to `yellow` without changing the output pattern for the other words.

Looking at the third and fourth examples, `zup` consistently corresponds to `yellow` regardless of its position. The color `blue` is consistent for the word ""lug"" and ""bluf"" across all examples, while ""dax"" corresponds to `green`.

Finally, in the last example, despite ""lug"" being before and after `zup`, `zup` remains `yellow`.

Therefore, according to the given examples, the rule for `zup` is that it always translates to `yellow` regardless of its position or surrounding context.

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-7.069829910326,83,zup
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that each word corresponds to a color:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to extra instances of the previous color word; when following ""dax"" or ""zup"" which was associated with yellow it repeats green or yellow, respectively
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""

Finally, ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" but only yields a single instance of yellow regardless of its position, unlike ""walm,"" which repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-7.613619603239999,83,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we can look at the patterns in the examples given and how the word ""zup"" alters the output each time it appears.

In the first example, we see that ""walm"" appears twice before ""zup"" and the output corresponds with ""green green red red red yellow."" Since ""walm"" seems to consistently map to ""green"" based on the other examples, and then changes after ""zup"" is used, this suggests that ""zup"" causes a transition or an alteration.

The second example shows ""zup"" following ""dax,"" which typically maps to ""green,"" but instead, the output is ""yellow."" Similarly, in the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""lug bluf wif,"" and the output begins with ""yellow,"" which suggests again that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""

From the fourth and fifth examples, we can see that whenever ""zup"" appears, the output that follows it starts with ""yellow."" This consistency across all examples gives us enough information to deduce that:

zup -> meaning. Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears, the next color in the sequence will be ""yellow.""",-8.965822895159999,83,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" is associated with a specific color output whenever it appears in the input. Specifically, the color output corresponding to ""zup"" is ""yellow"". It doesn't seem to matter where ""zup"" appears in the sequence, as its presence consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

So, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

zup -> yellow.",-10.234238620660001,83,zup
"In the given examples, the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow."" Each other word in the input corresponds to a different color in the output.

Here's how the colors correspond to the words:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue.""

When ""bluf"" appears in the string, regardless of what other words are present, it results in ""yellow yellow"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""",-4.86020774016,83,bluf
"Based on the given examples, each word appears to correspond to a specific color:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in examples where it follows ""zup"" and ""red"" in examples where it follows ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. It is either ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" or ""red"" when following ""wif."" There's no example of ""bluf"" following ""dax"" or ""lug"" to confirm its color in those cases. However, considering the pattern in which ""bluf"" adopts the color of the preceding word, a reasonable extension of the rule could be that ""bluf"" following ""dax"" would be ""green"" and following ""lug"" would be ""blue"".

Rule: bluf -> adopts the color of the preceding word.",-5.941494136939999,83,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns and possibly the position of the word in relation to the colors that are outputted after translation. 

From the examples, we can notice that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is consistently included twice in the output, regardless of the other words (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm"") present. It's reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the double occurrence of ""yellow"" in the output. 

The other words that appear alongside ""bluf"" seem to dictate the other colors in the output. For instance, ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" It's worth noting that ""bluf"" doesn't influence what these other colors are; it only introduces two yellows into the output sequence.

Thus, we can induce the rule that:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it.",-6.34892370472,83,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to double the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Explanation:
- In the first example ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""bluf"" outputs two yellows.
- In the second example ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""bluf"" outputs two reds.
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf"" is the part where ""bluf"" appears, and ""zup"" is associated with yellow, so ""bluf"" results in two yellows.
- Similarly, for the fourth and fifth examples, the output for ""bluf"" is a double of the color of the word before it.

Hence, bluf -> doubling the color of the preceding word.",-7.488867177539999,83,bluf
"Based on the data provided, each instance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow."" Therefore, it could be deduced that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" directly, irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. This conclusion is consistent across all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow yellow""",-8.93270820196,83,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each nonce word has a color associated with it except for ""walm,"" which instead seems to determine the number of times the preceding color repeats. The pattern of the word preceding ""walm"" being repeated in the output before switching to another color can be observed consistently in the given examples. 

We notice the following patterns specifically:
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue blue green"" (""lug"" stands for blue, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" for green)
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, ""bluf"" has no output, ""wif"" stands for red, and is repeated thrice due to ""walm"")
- ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" for red)
- ""dax walm zup walm"" -> ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"" (""dax"" stands for green, repeated thrice due to ""walm,"" followed by ""zup"" for yellow, which is then repeated thrice due to the second ""walm"")
- ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"" (""zup"" stands for yellow, repeated thrice due to ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" for green)

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the previous word is repeated three times before moving on to the next color if there is another word following ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the last word or is not followed by another color word, the pattern ends with the thrice-repeated color.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:
walm -> Triggers the repetition of the preceding word's associated color three times.",-1.076945488706,83,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it, repeated one more time than the previous word. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green,"" and ""lug"" is potentially associated with blue. Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it repeats the color blue three times (one more than two, which is the number of times ""blue"" would normally correspond to ""lug"").
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""wilm"" follows ""wif,"" which is red, it repeats red three times (once more than ""wif"" alone).
- In the third example, ""zup walm wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow, thus it repeats yellow three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm zup walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The ""walm"" after ""dax"" repeats green thrice, and the ""walm"" following ""zup"" repeats yellow three times.
- In the last example, ""zup walm dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Following the established pattern, ""walm"" after ""zup"" equals to yellow repeated three times.

So the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence an additional time.",-1.21223893029,83,walm
"Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the previous word multiple times. Specifically, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it three times. Here's the application of this rule to each input:

1. lug walm dax -> ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times. Then ""dax"" is green.
2. zup bluf wif walm -> ""zup"" is yellow, ""bluf"" is not given but would result in yellow, ""wif"" is red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.
3. zup walm wif -> ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, followed by ""wif"" which is red.
4. dax walm zup walm -> ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times. ""zup"" is yellow, so the next ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.
5. zup walm dax -> ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow three times. Then ""dax"" is green.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with that word three times.",-4.63780970658,83,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the input sequences and their corresponding outputs carefully.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green

From these examples, we observe that when ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, the following patterns are noticed in the output sequence:

1. The output sequences contain a repetition of colors.
2. The number of repeated colors seems to be dependent on the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
3. When ""walm"" immediately follows another word without repetition, it translates to that word's corresponding color being repeated in the output sequence as many times as the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
4. When ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of a word (""zup walm zup walm""), the corresponding color appears with a number of repetitions corresponding to the sum of the positions of each ""walm"".

As an example, in ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" appears in the second position, so ""yellow"" (the color corresponding to ""zup"") is repeated twice, followed by ""red"" (the color for ""wif""). However, in ""zup walm dax,"" ""walm"" is in the second position, so ""yellow"" is repeated three times (due to ""zup"" preceding ""walm"" and determining the number of repetitions), followed by ""green"" (the color for ""dax"").

Additionally, in ""dax walm zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" makes ""green"" appear thrice (because ""dax"" is in the first position and ""walm"" in the second), and the second ""walm"" makes ""yellow"" appear three times, not because of its direct position in sequence, but because the ""zup"" that comes before it is in the third position; hence ""yellow"" appears three times as well.

Rule: The word ""walm,"" when following a word, causes that word's corresponding color to repeat an amount equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, based on the observed patterns, the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> Causes the previous word's corresponding color to repeat an amount equal to walm's position in the sequence.",-6.349161036937,83,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look for patterns in the inputs and outputs.

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: blue blue blue green
  There is a repetition of the word blue three times before a green appears.

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
  Here, ""walm"" appears at the end and is translated to red repeated three times.

- Input: zup walm wif
  Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  In this case, ""walm"" results in a single red following two instances of yellow.

- Input: dax walm zup walm
  Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and each time it equates to three repetitions of the color preceding it.

- Input: zup walm dax
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green
  ""Walm"" is used after ""zup"" and results in three yellows followed by a green, which is the color for ""dax.""

From these examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in repeating the color corresponding to the word preceding it thrice. However, in cases where ""walm"" is at the end or followed by a different word, it might result in fewer repetitions or changing the color.

2. When ""dax"" precedes ""zup,"" the output starts with green followed by yellow:
   - Input: dax zup

3. When ""dax"" is followed by a sequence of words, including ""zup"" and ""wif,"" the output starts with green, and the colors that follow seem to correspond to the sequence of the words:

4. The pattern continues with the presence of ""lug"":
   - Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   - Output: green yellow blue red blue

"Given the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". However, the number of times ""yellow"" appears in the output appears to be dependent on the word that directly precedes ""zup"". Specifically, the number of ""yellow"" in the output after ""zup"" corresponds to the number of syllables in the preceding word. Here's how:

- In the first example, the word before ""zup"" is ""dax"", which has one syllable, thus there is one ""yellow"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup"" and also has one syllable, leading to one ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" again precedes ""zup"", leading to one ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, “walm” precedes ""zup"" and it has two syllables (wal-m), resulting in ""yellow"" appearing two times.
- In the last example, ""zup"" is immediately followed by ""walm"", so again, ""yellow"" appears three times because ""walm"" has two syllables.

Thus, the general rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

Rule: zup -> outputs ""yellow"" in the output as many times as there are syllables in the word immediately preceding ""zup"".",-8.32630843498,85,zup
"Based on the given examples, we notice that each time ""zup"" is used, it translates to the color ""yellow"". However, in the third and fourth examples, where ""walm"" appears after ""zup"", it seems to indicate a repetition of yellow according to the number of times ""walm"" is present in the input.

Thus, the rule derived from these examples is that ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, and if ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated for each ""walm"" that is present immediately after ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow. Additionally, if ""walm"" follows ""zup"", repeat yellow for each ""walm"".",-8.732755098628,85,zup
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow."" However, the word ""walm"" also seems to be associated with multiple repetitions of the color ""yellow."" In the examples where ""zup"" and ""walm"" occur together, the occurrence of ""yellow"" appears to be dependent on the presence and position of ""walm.""

Here's a breakdown of the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In example 2 (lug zup), the word ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow.""
- In examples 3 and 4, where ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" or preceded by ""walm,"" respectively, after ""zup"" comes a repetition of ""yellow"" that could correspond to the occurrences of ""walm.""
- Example 5 (zup walm) supports this as ""zup"" is followed by a repetition of ""yellow,"" which corresponds with the number of times ""walm"" appears after ""zup.""

Given this, it seems like the word ""zup"" introduces a sequence of ""yellow"" that will continue for as many instances as the word ""walm"" appears after ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> introduces a sequence of ""yellow"" that persists for as many instances as ""walm"" occurs immediately after it. If ""walm"" does not follow ""zup,"" then ""zup"" translates to a single ""yellow.""",-9.522571013768001,85,zup
"Looking at the examples provided, it appears that the word 'zup' has a consistent output across different inputs, which is the color 'yellow'. There doesn't seem to be a dependency on the preceding or following words to determine its meaning. The placement of 'zup' within the sequence does not alter its output - it always results in 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-9.785359065854001,85,zup
"Based on the provided examples, zup corresponds to the color yellow. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, whenever zup appears, the output is yellow. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-10.211912304668001,85,zup
"To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's look at how it's used across different contexts:

- In ""dax bluf wif,"" the output is ""green green red.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red.""
- In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" the output is ""yellow green green yellow green.""
- In ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif,"" the output is ""blue green green yellow blue red.""
- In ""wif bluf lug,"" the output is ""red red blue.""

Analyzing the strings and their respective outputs, ""bluf"" appears between known terms (e.g., dax, wif, zup, lug) that correspond to specific colors. Here's what we can gather from the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the color green is used twice.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the color red is used twice.
- In sequences where ""zup"" precedes or follows ""bluf,"" the color yellow is involved, but note that ""green"" from ""dax"" also overlaps when ""dax bluf zup"" occurs, rather than getting ""yellow green yellow.""
- When ""lug"" and ""bluf"" appear together, blue is an output.

Given these observations, ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition or continuation of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can infer the rule based on the provided data:

bluf -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: If ""x"" corresponds to a particular color, then ""x bluf"" yields the sequence of that color twice.",-1.11689552556,85,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"". 

Every instance where ""bluf"" is used, the output assigns the color green. This can be seen consistently across all examples provided. 

Other words within the examples are associated with different colors:

- ""dax"" always results in the color green being output.
- ""wif"" always leads to red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" specifically can be concluded as:
bluf -> green.",-4.8512755258,85,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" determines the color following its mention to be ""green."" The colors before and after the color ""green"" seem to depend on the words preceding them, not on ""bluf."" For example, ""dax"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green,"" and ""wif"" after ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" specifically changes the color output to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Here's the rule in the requested format:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The presence of the word ""bluf"" indicates the color ""green"" should follow in the output.",-6.71623858722,85,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.",-8.490557951800001,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the components that change with its presence compared to those that don't. The word ""bluf"" seems to always result in the output ""green"" immediately after it, regardless of what other words precede or follow it. This can be seen clearly because no matter the context, the word after ""bluf"" is always ""green"" in the output.

Rule:
- ""bluf"" -> The word immediately following ""bluf"" translates to ""green"" in the output.",-8.963637756899999,85,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns and commonalities of the input-output pairs given:

1. Input: **wif lug walm**
   Output: **red blue blue blue**

2. Input: **dax walm zup lug dax**
   Output: **green green green yellow blue green**

3. Input: **dax zup dax walm**
   Output: **green yellow green green green**

4. Input: **dax walm wif**
   Output: **green green green red**

5. Input: **zup walm lug wif**
   Output: **yellow yellow yellow blue red**

The pattern that emerges here is that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it:

1. ""walm"" is followed by nothing, but the previous color is blue, and the output is blue.
2. ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" which translates to yellow, so the output is green followed by three yellow.
3. ""walm"" is at the end, but the previous words are all ""dax,"" which is green, hence the green after walm.
4. ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which translates to red, resulting in green followed by red.
5. ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to blue, so the output is yellow followed by blue.

Based on this pattern, ""walm"" may be a function that copies the color of the following word, but when it is at the end, it repeats the color of the previous word(s). Since ""walm"" doesn't appear at the beginning to test this, the rule might be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""walm"" means ""repeat the color of the following word; if at the end, repeat the color of the previous word(s).""

This rule is consistent with all given examples.",-0.661266005734,85,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each input and output pair.

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" After ""lug"" comes ""walm,"" and the output is ""blue blue."" This may indicate that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, which in this case is ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""green"" again, followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug,"" ending with ""green"" for the final ""dax."" The ""walm"" here also appears to repeat the color related to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - The pattern continues with ""dax"" leading to ""green,"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" then ""green"" for ""dax,"" and lastly, ""walm"" results in ""green green,"" again indicating a repetition of the preceding color.

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - Following the pattern, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" leads to a repeat of ""green,"" with ""wif"" changing the output to ""red."" 

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""yellow."" Subsequently, ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red.""

Based on the patterns observed in these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word.",-6.636752977205001,85,walm
"Looking at the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule for the word ""walm"":

1. In every output where ""walm"" is present, the word that follows ""walm"" is repeated multiple times (colored the same).

2. The number of times the following word is repeated (and thus its color in the output) seems to be dependent on the number of letters in the following word:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue"" since ""lug"" is a 3-letter word and the output has 3 blue words after the initial ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" since ""zup"" is a 3-letter word and the output has 3 yellow words after the initial ""yellow.""
- ""wif walm"" only appears once in the examples, but the output sequence is ""red,"" with no additional repetition after ""walm.""

With these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" makes the following word's corresponding color repeat a number of times equal to the length of that word.

Walm -> Makes the following word appear in the output as many times as there are letters in the word following ""walm.""",-7.56748709723,85,walm

1. Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue

3. Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green 
4. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red 
5. Input: zup walm lug wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red 

Observations:
- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" and the corresponding output color changes from blue to blue blue. This could suggest that ""walm"" involves repeating the previous color, but we need more examples to confirm.
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color changes from green to green green. Similarly, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color, but this time it's doing it twice as ""green green"" follows.
- The third example supports the idea that ""walm"" repeats the previous color because we see ""dax walm"" translating to ""green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm wif,"" also supports the repetition pattern as ""green green green"" corresponds to ""dax walm,"" even though it's followed by a different color.
- Finally, the fifth example has ""zup walm lug wif"" translating to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Here, ""zup walm"" results in a triple ""yellow"" repetition followed by new colors.

"To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's analyze the patterns regarding the position of ""lug"" and the associated output colors:

1. Whenever ""lug"" appears after ""dax,"" the color after ""lug"" is blue:
    - dax lug walm -> green blue blue
    - dax lug dax -> green blue green

2. When ""lug"" is at the beginning or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" the color pattern changes:
    - lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue
    - lug wif bluf -> blue red red
    - wif bluf lug -> red red blue

3. ""lug"" never outputs the color green directly after it. Green appears before ""lug"" if ""lug"" is preceded by ""dax,"" otherwise, ""lug"" outputs blue.

The consistent pattern is that ""lug"" is followed by blue except when ""lug"" is at the end or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" which changes the subsequent colors.

Rule: lug -> when followed by any term except ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" outputs blue; when leading or followed by ""wif"" or ""bluf,"" affects subsequent colors (does not output blue right after the word but changes the pattern).",-4.496349770292,86,lug

"Rule: bluf -> the color word that comes immediately before it, repeated the same number of times as there are unique colors mentioned so far. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word just before it (in this case, blue). Since ""lug"" is the only color mentioned before ""bluf,"" it is repeated once.

- In the second example, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the preceding color word (red), and because two unique colors have been mentioned before “bluf” (red and blue), red is repeated twice. ""Walm"" seems to introduce a new color (green), which follows the previous logic of increasing the count of instances based on previously mentioned unique colors (three unique colors so far: red, blue, green).

- In the third and fourth examples, ""dax bluf zup"" and ""dax zup bluf,"" the word ""bluf,"" again, repeats the preceding color word (green in the third example and yellow in the fourth). For the third example, since two unique colors (blue and green) have been mentioned before ""bluf"", it repeats green twice. In the fourth example, since two unique colors (green and yellow) have been mentioned, it repeats yellow twice.

- The fifth example, ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow red blue green."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the color word that appears just before it. Before ""bluf,"" we have seen two unique colors (blue and yellow), so yellow is repeated twice.

"Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to correlate with a repetition of the color that follows the word ""walm"". The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of words before ""walm"". 

Here is the breakdown of the rules:
- ""lug walm wif"" has one word before ""walm"" (lug) and the output is three instances of the color blue, followed by a different color, red, which represents ""wif"".
- ""wif walm"" has one word before ""walm"" (wif) and the output is three instances of the color red.
- ""dax walm"" has one word before ""walm"" (dax) and the output is three instances of the color green.
- ""zup walm dax"" has two words before ""walm"" (zup walm) and the output is three instances of the color yellow followed by green, which represents ""dax"".
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" has three words before ""walm"" (lug walm wif) and the output is three instances of the color blue, followed by yellow then red, both representing ""wif"".

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow"", where ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif bluf"" translates to ""green red red"". ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""bluf"" also correlates with ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax wif"" results in ""green red"". Again, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""wif"" correlates with ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif dax"" results in ""red green"", where ""wif"" comes first and correlates with ""red"", followed by ""dax"", which correlates with ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red"". ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" correlates with ""red"", ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to produce an additional ""red"".

There is a consistent pattern where ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the Output.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.0345891008780002,87,wif
"Based on the input provided and the corresponding output, we can observe the following:

1. When ""wif"" precedes a word, the word ""red"" is added to the output before the corresponding color of the word that follows ""wif"". For instance:
   - ""wif zup"" => ""red yellow""
   - ""dax wif bluf"" includes ""red"" before ""red"" for ""bluf""
   - ""wif dax"" => ""red green""

2. When ""wif"" follows a word, the word ""red"" is added to the output after the color corresponding to the word before ""wif"". For example:
   - ""dax wif"" => ""green red""
   - ""zup bluf wif walm"" => ""yellow yellow red red red"" (""wif"" follows ""bluf"" which is ""yellow"", so ""red"" follows ""yellow"")

3. ""wif"" does not generate a unique color outcome when it stands alone without a context word before or after it.

It seems that ""wif"" acts as a trigger to add the color ""red"" to the output sequence. Moreover, the position of the word ""wif"" affects where ""red"" shows up in the sequence: before the color it immediately precedes or after the color it immediately follows.

Rule: wif -> Inserts the color ""red"" into the color sequence either before or after the color of the adjacent word, depending on its position. If ""wif"" precedes a word, ""red"" comes before that word's color in the output. If ""wif"" follows a word, ""red"" comes after that word's color in the output.",-3.06374821344,87,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" This conclusion is drawn from the fact that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. 

The position of ""wif"" within the input does not appear to change its translation to ""red."" Also, noting the patterns with other words such as ""dax"" consistently translating to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it appears that each word directly translates to a specific color.

Thus the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-4.2563816994799994,87,wif

Rule: wif -> red.",-6.548149131360001,87,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" The rule can be deduced as follows:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output always includes the word ""red.""
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not seem to affect its corresponding color in the output.
- Inputs without ""wif"" do not have ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, we can conclude:

1. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and is followed by ""bluf"", which therefore also corresponds to yellow.

3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to red, making ""bluf"" red in this instance.

4. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to green. ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: lug bluf

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" alone translates to ""yellow yellow,"" further supporting the first example.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" turns into ""red red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is represented as ""green green,"" remaining consistent with the rule that ""bluf"" is the preceding or following color word, repeated.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" equates to ""blue blue,"" adhering to the established pattern.

"Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word. If there's no preceding word, there's no output for bluf.

- lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red

- wif -> red, walm -> red (from the word following walm's position in the sequence, which is ""dax"" that maps to green but the context indicates that the word before ""walm"" is being repeated)

From these examples, we infer that ""walm"" signifies to repeat the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.",-1.192777849026,88,walm

3. dax walm zup lug dax -> green green green yellow blue green
4. lug walm dax wif lug wif -> blue blue blue green red blue red
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Looking at these examples, we notice that ""walm"" is followed by the color green each time. Additionally, the color preceding ""walm"" changes and matches the color of the word positioned before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In (1), ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both are followed by the color green.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to a series of color outputs determined by the word that follows it. The rules for ""zup"" seem to be as follows:

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" produces the color ""yellow"" plus the color(s) associated with the word that comes after ""zup."" The word that follows ""zup"" seems to determine the additional colors. For instance, ""wif"" somehow leads to ""red,"" ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to translate into three times the color ""yellow."" Since the color yellow is consistent with the use of ""zup,"" it can be inferred that ""zup"" signifies the color yellow plus a sequence of colors linked to the subsequent word.

However, these rules are not absolutely definitive since there is no example directly showing the color output for ""walm,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug"" in isolation. The inference relies on their use in conjunction with ""zup"" and their positions relative to other words whose color associations we do see consistently (like ""wif"" always being associated with the color red).

Here's the rationale:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in an input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""yellow"" in the output corresponds to the position of ""zup"" in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

- ""lug zup bluf dax"" resulted in ""blue yellow yellow green""
- ""lug bluf"" resulted in ""blue blue""

"Rule: The word bluf means ""repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word.""

This rule can be inferred from the examples as follows:

- In the first example, ""wif"" results in ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" the output is ""red red.""
- The second example begins with ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" both colors are repeated, ""red red."" ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" again and is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue.""

- The fourth example shows that ""lug"" results in ""blue,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- The fifth example indicates that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""bluf,"" ""green"" is repeated.

"walm -> rule. Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" results in repeated color output associated with the immediately preceding color word. The number of repetitions seems to be based on the number of color-specific words that have immediately preceded it. 

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color denoted by the word before it as many times as that color has appeared before ""walm"".

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" which is coded as ""yellow"" has occurred twice before ""walm"", hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being outputted four more times after the first two, for a total of six ""yellow"" instances.
  
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup"" (yellow), thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being outputted one more time, for a total of three ""yellow"" instances.
  
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows a pattern of two ""lug"" (blue), one ""bluf"" (also blue), followed by two ""wif"" (red) and then another ""lug"" (blue). By the time ""walm"" is said, ""lug"" has been mentioned twice and ""bluf"" once, totaling three instances of the color ""blue."" ""Walm"" thus results in three additional instances of ""blue.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows two ""lug"" (blue), so it results in two additional instances of ""blue.""
  
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows one ""wif"" (red) and no other color word has been mentioned before ""wif"", so ""walm"" results in two instances of ""red.""

So to summarize, ""walm"" can be understood as an instruction to output the previously mentioned color a number of times equal to the number of times that color has occurred so far in the sequence.",-7.83034975068,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" and ""lug"" to ""yellow"" as well. However, the introduction of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to a sequence of ""yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may represent ""yellow"" or perhaps a repetition of the preceding color.

2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green

In this example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" comes after ""zup"" and before ""yellow"" is repeated in the output. This reinforces the repetition idea, where ""walm"" seems to repeat the previous color, which is ""yellow.""

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and again, following ""wif,"" we see ""walm,"" which results in ""red"" being repeated in the output. This example also supports the repetition concept.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

In this case, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" yields a repetition of ""blue"" in the output, following the established repetition pattern.

5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

As seen before, ""zup"" matches ""yellow,"" ""wif"" matches ""red,"" and ""lug"" matches ""blue."" ""Walm"" occurs after ""wif"" and causes ""red"" to repeat in the output.

Given the patterns observed, it appears that ""walm"" is a rule that repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.",-8.491900422561,89,walm
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to a color that repeats the color of the word before it. Each time ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the color directly before it is repeated.

To break it down:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow and is directly before ""walm,"" resulting in an output of an additional ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"", ""wif"" is red and is directly before ""walm,"" resulting in an output of an additional ""red.""

Reviewing all examples, it's consistent that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding element.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word.
Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" the color output for ""walm"" is the same as the color output for the word that comes before it.",-9.463134534679998,89,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the input and output in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow 
   
2. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   
3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   
5. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

From the pattern in the examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that precedes it. Here's the pattern in each:

1. The ""walm"" follows a ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" leading to repeated ""yellow"" in the output.
2. Again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), resulting in extra ""yellow"" in the output.
3. Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and ""red"" is repeated in the output.
4. The ""walm"" follows a ""lug,"" and we see a repetition of ""blue"" in the output.
5. ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in additional ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that precedes it to be repeated until the next color word appears or the sequence ends.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns related to the appearance of ""dax"" and its corresponding color in the output:

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue,"" and we see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""dax"" would correspond to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug dax lug wif"" translates to ""blue green blue red,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug dax lug"" translates to ""red blue green blue,"" again ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" confirming that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" where ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" The new word ""zup"" at the end correlates with ""yellow.""

So, by examining these examples, we can induce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string. 

Rule: dax -> green",-0.8674851914739999,90,dax
"By examining the relationship between the input and output phrases, we can deduce a potential rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax.""

In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" corresponds to ""green green green blue."" Given that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" consistently in all examples and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"" when followed by ""dax,"" we could infer that ""dax"" has an effect on the word that follows it. When ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is tripled green ""green green green.""

In the second and third examples, ""dax"" is positioned between two instances of ""lug"" (which consistently translates to ""blue""), and it leads to the output ""green"" in both cases.

The fourth example shows ""lug dax"" translating to ""blue green,"" further supporting the consistent translation of ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"" when it follows ""lug"".

Finally, the fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" corresponds to ""green green green red red red yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif,"" which it affects by repeating the color associated with the word that follows ""dax."" In this case, ""walm"" normally translates to ""green,"" so following ""dax,"" it produces a triplet of ""green green green."" Similarly, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" so following ""dax,"" it produces a triplet of ""red red red.""

Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" seems to create a rule where the color associated with the word that follows ""dax"" is repeated three times.

- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" when referenced.
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" when referenced.
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to ""green"" but when not preceded immediately by ""dax"" it translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" seems to change the color of the word that immediately follows it to ""green"".

By looking at these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

dax -> Changes the color of the following word to green, unless that word inherently translates to another color that does not change in relation to ""dax"".

Rule: If ""dax"" precedes a noun, that noun translates to ""green,"" unless said noun has a predetermined color that does not vary based on ""dax"" (such as ""lug"" which is always ""blue"", ""wif"" which is always ""red"", and ""zup"" which is ""yellow"").",-6.039312472013999,90,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the word 'dax' seems to change its meaning depending on the position it is in the input sequence. We can try to infer the rule by examining the outputs related to the position of 'dax'.

1. When 'dax' is in the first position, its corresponding output is 'green'.
2. When 'dax' is in the second position, its corresponding output is 'green'.
3. When 'dax' is in the third position, its corresponding output is 'green'.
4. Although not shown explicitly, we can hypothesize based on the pattern that if 'dax' were in the fourth position, the output might also be 'green'.
5. When 'dax' is followed by 'walm', it results in 'green green', and when followed by 'wif', it results in 'green red'. This might indicate that 'dax' outputs 'green' for a subsequent 'walm' and 'red' for a subsequent 'wif', regardless of position.

Given these observations, the rule regarding 'dax' does not seem to refer to its position. Rather, it seems to be related to the words that come after it. However, the examples are not clear on this pattern because we only have two instances where 'dax' is followed by another word ('walm' and 'wif'), and both times it outputs 'green' first regardless of the following word.

If we focus on the consistent aspect among the examples, the presence of 'dax' always corresponds to at least one 'green' in the output. There isn't enough consistent data regarding its interaction with the following words to make a solid rule based on these examples alone.

Given this limitation, the most consistent rule we can deduce from the provided examples is as follows:

There is no example indicating what the output would be if dax is followed by a different word or at the end of a sequence, nor is there information about what the output would be for dax followed by zup.

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' is associated with the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' appears in the output the same number of times as 'wif' appears.

- In the second example, 'wif bluf lug' translates to 'red red blue', where 'red red' follows 'wif'.
- In the third example, 'zup dax wif' results in 'yellow green red', with 'red' being the translation of 'wif'.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern remains consistent, where 'wif' corresponds to 'red' in the output each time 'wif' appears.

Therefore, the rule for the word 'wif' is:

Rule: wif -> red",-4.868489227212001,90,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently leads to the output of ""red."" However, the number of times ""red"" occurs in the output does not directly correspond to the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence.

Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" which outputs to triple ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   In this case, ""wif"" precedes two words and leads to double ""red"" followed by another color associated with ""lug"" (implied to be ""blue"").

3. Input: zup dax wif

   ""Wif"" is the last word in the sequence and translates to a single ""red.""

4. Input: wif dax zup dax

5.  Input: dax zup walm wif walm

    Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which in earlier instances led to ""red"" but this time is followed by two consecutive occurrences of ""walm"" after ""wif,"" resulting in triple ""red"" in the output.

The recurring theme is that ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" but when ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is multiple ""red."" It appears that ""wif"" may dictate that ""red"" should be outputted at least once, and when followed by ""walm"" it results in additional repetition of ""red"" in the output. It is not clear from the examples given how many additional instances of ""red"" are outputted due to additional instances of ""walm"" following ""wif""; more data would be needed to refine this aspect of the rules.

Based on the given data, the rule I can induce is as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" appears consecutively after ""wif.""

Therefore, the simplest rule that fits all examples would be:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should identify the rule by looking for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs.

In example 3, we see ""wif bluf"" again with the output ""red red"", which confirms that each instance of ""wif"" and ""bluf"" maps to the color red. 

In example 4, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"". This implies that ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it (since ""dax"" is mapped to green).

In example 5, ""zup wif bluf zup"" corresponds to ""yellow red red yellow"". The word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is mapped to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to red. Again, ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it.

"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. Let's try to match the colors with the words.

From the first two examples:
- ""wif lug"" consistently translates to ""red blue"".

In the third example:
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue"".
- Since ""lug"" has been established as ""blue"" from the first two examples, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" yields another ""yellow"", so it may be redundant or it could mean the same as ""zup"".

Looking at the fourth example, we have new information:
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"".
- The previously established ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"".
- ""dax"" is new, which corresponds to ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to the repeated ""yellow"", but it's a different word from ""zup"" which also translates to ""yellow"". This suggests that ""wif"" may serve as a reset for the sequence of colors.

In the last example:
- ""dax wif zup"" translates to ""green red yellow"".
- Here ""dax"" is ""green"" which is consistent with the previous example, ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""zup"" is ""yellow"".

Therefore, we can induce that:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" but when preceded by ""wif"" it also results in ""yellow"".

Hence, the rule we can induce is that ""wif"" likely refers to the color ""red"". However, there's an additional pattern that suggests ""wif"" might play a role in resetting or affecting the sequence of colors afterward. Based on the given information it's hard to determine an exact rule for this.

To summarize the relationship:

- ""zup"" by itself results in ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by other words generates repeated ""yellow"" outputs.

The other words in the examples can be analyzed to figure out their corresponding colors:

- ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color red, since it maps to ""red"" in the outputs when it follows ""zup.""
- ""lug"" is slightly unclear, but given it appears once and maps to ""blue,"" we can tentatively say it means ""blue.""
- ""walm"" seems to generate additional ""yellow"" outputs, but whether it amplifies the output of ""zup"" or has its own mapping to ""yellow"" isn't entirely clear from the examples provided.
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" as seen in the ""dax zup"" combination.

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever we see the input ""zup,"" the output consistently includes ""yellow.""

When ""zup"" is used in different contexts with other nonce words, it always corresponds to the color yellow in the output. Other words, like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax,"" correspond to different colors themselves, but the presence of ""zup"" always results in the color yellow in the output. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

- The word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow.""

- The word ""lug"" results in the output ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" results in the output that repeats the previous color (in this case, ""yellow"").
- The word ""dax"" results in the output ""green.""

Using these rules, our induction regarding the meaning of the word ""zup"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".",-5.876412407880001,91,zup

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-6.6499629897800006,91,zup
"By examining the outputs for each given input, we can attempt to associate the nonce word ""bluf"" with a color, pattern, or rule.

Let's break down each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

4. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

Analysis:

- In all output sequences where ""bluf"" is present, the output always ends with ""red red"".
- The word that precedes ""bluf"" is either ""wif,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" and in the corresponding output, the color before ""red red"" is always ""red"". Considering this pattern, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" is associated with the word ""red red"".
- ""dax,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" have consistent colors across the examples (green, green, and blue, respectively), which implies that the meaning of these words is independent of ""bluf"".

Given this information, we can induce the rule:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" is associated with the repeated sequence ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present in the input.",-5.732423276208,91,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the consistencies and patterns in the input-output pairs:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears twice in the output.
- ""Bluf"" is always preceded by ""wif"" in the input (except for the first example, where it follows ""wif"" with one word in between).

This pattern suggests a rule: When ""bluf"" appears, it translates to two instances of the word ""red"" in the output, and this seems to be independent of the position of ""bluf"" within the input sequence.

Additionally, let's look at how the preceding words might affect the output:

- ""wif"" always translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" also translates to ""green"".

Therefore, the word immediately preceding ""bluf"" will appear as its corresponding color in the output before the two instances of ""red"" that represent ""bluf"".

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""red red"" in output, irrespective of other context.",-6.4486610677480005,91,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red, as seen in each example. However, when ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that the combination of ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" translates to two reds in sequence. 

With this in mind, the rule can be defined as:
- bluf alone corresponds to ""red""
- wif bluf together corresponds to ""red red""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. 
Rule: When bluf appears alone, it means ""red"". When bluf is preceded by wif, it means ""red red"".",-7.97634173212,91,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" appearing twice in the output sequence. Therefore, the rule is that whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, it results in ""red red"" in the output.

"Observing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" affects the output in the following way:

- When ""walm"" is present, it generates a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the word preceding it up to the point where ""walm"" is mentioned. 

Analyzing the examples:

1. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm,"" we have three ""green"" in a row.

2. ""dax walm lug"" results in ""green green green blue"". We see that ""walm"" caused three ""green"" (for ""dax"") to appear, followed by ""blue"", which corresponds to ""lug"".

3. ""dax walm zup lug"" results in ""green green green yellow blue"". We have three ""green"" after ""walm"" with ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"" following.

4. ""lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". This indicates that ""walm"" causes the word before it (""zup"" leading to ""yellow"") to repeat until we reach another ""lug"", which is ""blue"".

5. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow"". This shows that ""walm"" causes ""wif"" (red) to repeat thrice before continuing with ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

From these observations, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat for three consecutive outputs before continuing with the color outputs for the remaining words.

Therefore:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the word ""green"" is repeated three times, which indicates ""walm"" might be causing the repetition.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" still follows ""dax"" and the output consists of three ""green"" followed by ""blue"" which is associated with ""lug"".
3. The third example suggests that ""zup"" introduces a ""yellow"" and that the effect of ""walm"" still applies as ""green"" is repeated three times, followed by ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" while ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug""; the outcome is two occurrences of ""yellow"" after ""walm,"" which might be due to ""zup"" occurring earlier.

"Analyzing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, it becomes apparent that each word translates to a specific color. Below is the breakdown of the translations based on the examples:

- ""wif"" -> red
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue

When observing how the word ""bluf"" is translated to colors, it is consistent that it translates to the same color as the word that precedes it. Here are the specific instances:

1. After ""wif dax zup"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (the same as the preceding ""dax"").
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", its output is ""yellow"" (the same as ""zup"").
3. After ""lug wif"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" (the same as the preceding ""wif"").
4. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" alone, the output is ""blue"" (the same as ""lug"").
5. Lastly, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax zup"", its output is ""yellow"" (the same as the preceding ""zup"").

Based on the above analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it translates to the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. If there's no word before it (which is not the case in any of the examples provided), there would be insufficient data to determine the output.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.",-6.56527699804,93,bluf

Thus, the rule seems to be:

2. In examples where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which translates to ""yellow,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input and output patterns:

1. ""zup dax walm"" gives ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color ""green.""

2. ""wif walm dax zup"" yields ""red red red green yellow."" ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green"" again, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red.""

3. ""zup wif walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red red red blue."" In this case, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is linked to the repetition of ""red.""

4. ""dax walm lug"" becomes ""green green green blue."" Here, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is again tied to the repetition of ""green.""

5. ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of ""yellow.""

From the observed patterns, it seems like the nonce word ""walm"" is related to repeating the color of the word that precedes it. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the word right before it is repeated for the remainder of the series until a different color word is encountered. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a rule for repetition.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-1.047345296798,93,walm
"From the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that precedes it. To confirm this, let's look at each example:

1. In ""zup dax walm,"" the output is ""yellow green green green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in the repetition of ""green"" three times after ""dax.""

2. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" leading to a repetition of ""red"" twice after ""wif.""

3. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow red red red blue."" ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" causing a repetition of ""red"" two more times after ""wif.""

4. In ""dax walm lug,"" the output is ""green green green blue."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green"" and is followed by three ""green"" before ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

5. In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see two more ""yellow"" following it.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output. However, there is an inconsistency: In example 2, ""red"" is repeated only twice, unlike in other cases. This might indicate an incomplete understanding or that there's another rule at play affecting the number of repetitions when there are additional words following ""walm.""

Nevertheless, considering the majority pattern, the rule induced for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color, the output is the repetition of that color three additional times.

Based on the above inductions:

walm -> the repetition of the preceding color word three times.",-1.1405047777459998,93,walm
"To determine the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs closely.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""walm"" appears to contribute three instances of ""green"".

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" appears to contribute three instances of the color before it. In this instance: ""red"".

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" appears to again contribute three instances of the color before it, which is ""red"".

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" gives us three instances of ""green"" which is the color represented by ""dax"".

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" corresponds to three ""yellow"", which is the color represented by ""zup"".

Based on these observations, we can infer:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color represented by the word directly before it, three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is that it causes the color represented by the preceding word to appear three times in sequence.",-6.087554071862001,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green
2. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
3. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
4. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
5. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow

We can notice that for every occurrence of the word ""walm"" in the input, there is a sequence of repeating colors in the output.

In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup dax"" and the output is a sequence of three greens followed by a yellow.
In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is three reds before the color sequence changes.
In example 3, ""walm"" is again following 'wif' and produces three reds before the colors change.
In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three greens before the color changes.
In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces a sequence of three yellows.

Given these observations, it seems that ""walm"" produces a repetition of the color immediately before it. Furthermore, the number of repetitions corresponds to three given the available examples. 

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word before it to be repeated three times.",-8.816284707448,93,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the colors outputted in relation to the other words:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds with three instances of the color green.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" precedes two instances of the color red.
3. In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by one instance of the color red.
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" is again followed by a sequence of green.
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of yellow.

From looking at the patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" does not correspond with a fixed color; instead, its output color appears to be influenced by the context, specifically the words that are adjacent to ""walm"". However, ""walm"" generates the same color multiple times sequentially.

Looking at the examples, we can see the color sequence tends to repeat the color of the word preceding ""walm"" except in the fifth example, where it is placed at the end and repeats the last output color (yellow from ""zup"").

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be as follows:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by another word (zup, wif, dax), it takes the color associated with that preceding word and repeats it for a sequence of three (as in examples 1 and 4) or however many times ""walm"" is in sequence (as in example 5 with two instances of yellow).
- If ""walm"" is followed by another word, it seems to repeat the color it just outputted one time for the following word (seen in examples 2 and 3, where it is followed by red and blue, respectively, after outputting red).

2. Input: zup lug zup wif dax

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - Again, ""dax"" appears first, and its output is ""green."" ""Zup"" follows ""dax"" and its output is ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug
   Output: blue blue green blue

"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine how the output colors correspond to the input words:

In all examples, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

In examples where ""wif"" is followed by another word:
- ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow""
- ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue""
- ""wif dax wif lug wif"" translates to ""red green red blue red,"" which suggests that when ""wif"" is followed by another ""wif"" or a word that has already been established (like ""dax""), it still corresponds to ""red.""

In examples where ""wif"" is not followed by a word immediately, the output is just ""red"":
- ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red""

From the pattern, we can observe that ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" regardless of the context. Based on this consistency:

Rule: wif -> red",-4.84409329506,94,wif
"Given the examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" introduces the color ""red"". When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the sequence is ""red green"". When ""wif"" stands alone or is followed by a word other than ""dax"" or ""lug"", it corresponds to ""red"", and when it precedes ""lug"", ""lug"" remains ""blue"". 

The most consistent interpretation is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". However, other words might maintain their color association regardless of the presence of ""wif"". There is only one instance of ""bluf"" which becomes ""yellow"", but this example is not sufficient to define an overarching rule for the word ""bluf"" when it appears in conjunction with ""wif"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the given examples, you can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is red.
- The word before ""wif"" does not seem to affect this pattern, as ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" irrespective of the preceding word.
- The words after ""wif"" follow their specific color pattern without being affected by the presence of ""wif.""

The evidence for the rule is that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence.

Therefore:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.",-9.280987768227998,94,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to consider its position and relation to other words and outputs in each example. We will examine the before-and-after relations of ""wif"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

1. In ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""wif"" is preceded by ""bluf"" and followed by ""zup,"" with the related output for ""wif"" being red. However, there are no direct precedents to establish a clear rule, so we will consider more examples.

2. ""dax wif"" has ""dax"" before ""wif"" and nothing follows. The output is ""green red."" We note that ""wif"" translates to red again.

3. ""wif lug"" starts with ""wif"" followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""red blue."" Again, ""wif"" corresponds to red.

4. ""wif dax wif lug wif"" repeats the word ""wif"" multiple times, with outputs consistently being ""red"" for ""wif"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.

5. In ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax,"" ""wif"" follows a sequence of different words and the output for ""wif"" remains red, while the words preceding ""wif"" are irrelevant to its color output.

From these examples, the rule for ""wif"" is not dependent on context or neighboring words. It consistently translates to the color red regardless of its position or surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red",-10.4047129094,94,wif

When ""bluf"" is repeated after itself or follows a word with no established rule, it retains the same color as the preceding ""bluf"" or word. Thus:

- After ""dax"" bluf means ""green"".
- After ""wif"" bluf means ""red"".
- After ""lug"" bluf means ""blue"".
- After ""zup"" bluf means ""yellow"".
- After ""bluf"" or an undefined word it means the same color as the word before it.

"From the given examples, we can induce the following:

1. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output color is the same as the output for ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output color is the same as the output for ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""
4. When ""bluf"" is isolated with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating that the color for ""bluf"" matches the color for ""lug.""
5. In the presence of other words (""walm,"" ""wif""), the output for ""bluf"" is still the same as the preceding word (""lug""), which is ""blue.""

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that its output color matches the output color of the word that immediately precedes it.

So, the rule is:
bluf -> The output color of ""bluf"" matches the output color of the word immediately before it.",-5.46173927516,94,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it. If there is no preceding word, it defaults to red. 

Explanation:
- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to green, so ""bluf"" is green.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which translates to red, so ""bluf"" is red.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"" respectively, so it imitates their respective colors (blue and yellow).
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" repeats the color blue twice due to ""lug"" preceding it both times.

Exceptions:
- However, we see that when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"" in the second example, ""bluf"" gives a red output instead of yellow. Since this is contradictory to the previous rule, we can revise our rule to include an exception: when ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup,"" it produces red, unless the sequence of ""lug bluf"" or ""zup bluf"" provides context for an alternate rule behavior (blue for ""lug bluf"" and yellow for ""zup bluf"" as standalone pairs).
- In this context, the rule that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word immediately preceding it seems to hold true, with the noted exception when the preceding word is ""zup"", unless it's within the specific context of a standalone ""zup bluf"" pair.",-5.822127510311999,94,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the consistent patterns in the examples.

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

However, in the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color immediately preceding it. 

In the final example, we see ""lug bluf,"" which, based on patterns in earlier examples, yields ""blue blue."" Additionally, ""wif lug bluf"" produces ""blue red blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" replicated the color of the preceding word once again.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following pattern:

""bluf"" copies the color indicated by the word immediately before it. If ""bluf"" appears without a preceding color indicator, it defaults to red.

Rule: bluf -> It replicates the color word before it, or defaults to red if it is the second word.",-6.285935297886001,94,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. The word or color that immediately precedes bluf is repeated as the output for bluf.

Rule: When bluf is preceded by a color-related word, the output for bluf is the color associated with the preceding word. If bluf follows a non-color-related word, the output for bluf is red.",-9.26516977296,94,bluf
"Based on the series of inputs and outputs provided, the word ""walm"" has a pattern associated with it. By examining the output colors corresponding to the place where ""walm"" appears in the input, a rule can be derived.

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup walm lug wif bluf -> yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
4. zup lug walm wif walm -> yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

From the first input/output pair, ""walm"" yields three instances of red and one green after ""wif"".
In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug"" and ""wif"", resulting in three yellows, one blue, and two reds.
In the third example, when ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it produces three blues.
In the fourth example, ""walm"" occurs twice, each time giving rise to extra reds in the sequence.
In the fifth example, ""walm"" is solely preceded by ""zup"" and it yields three yellows.

From this analysis, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be that it generates outputs that repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Whereas the standalone occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" results in three of the color that would correspond to ""zup"".

Therefore, the tentative rule is:
Rule: walm -> ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it; if ""walm"" is the only word following ""zup"", it generates three instances of the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow).",-1.1037322738380002,94,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the color output related to the words that precede it. To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""walm,"" let's break down the patterns stemming from each example:

- Example 1: ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green."" After ""walm,"" the color ""red"" repeats, but ""dax"" changes the color to green.
- Example 2: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" After ""walm,"" ""lug"" changes the color to blue, and ""wif"" changes to red, causing a repeat in red.
- Example 3: ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" After ""walm,"" the following colors do not change.
- Example 4: ""zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" The sequence pattern changes to blue after ""walm,"" and then it repeats ""red"" after the second ""walm.""
- Example 5: ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" No other colors are present after ""walm.""

The consistent pattern is that the color word immediately after ""walm"" repeats multiple times. In the first and second examples, it repeats three times; in the third and fourth examples, the pattern repeats but without an exact specified number, and in the fifth example, it repeats the color for all the occurrences of ""zup"" before it.

Thus, ""walm"" might be a rule that specifies to repeat the color of the word that follows it a number of times equivalent to the number of times ""zup"" occurred before it, or, in a more general sense, it might have to do with repeating the color of the following word a context-dependent number of times.

Rule: walm -> causes the following word's associated color to be repeated a number of times related to the count of a preceding word or a context-dependent number of times.",-1.171737026704,94,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns in the inputs and outputs provided. Let's examine each input-output pair and identify the rules that might be applied.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" leads to the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" as previously seen, corresponds to ""red.""
- We can't determine what ""bluf"" means here since it only appears once.

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  
Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the above patterns, we see that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single color since it leads to different colors in the output (red, blue). It appears to replicate the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color of the word that precedes it to be repeated one or more times.

walm -> The rule is that ""walm"" duplicates the output color of the immediately preceding word.",-6.941214640059,94,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns and rules in the inputs and outputs provided. 

Here are the outputs alongside their respective inputs for easier comparison:

1. Input: wif walm dax - Output: red red red green
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. Input: wif dax lug walm - Output: red green blue blue blue
4. Input: zup lug walm wif walm - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
5. Input: zup walm - Output: yellow yellow yellow

If we analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in different positions in the input string, and the corresponding outputs, we can draw the following observations:

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" or precedes ""dax"" respectively, and the output is ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"" followed by ""green"" or ""blue blue blue"" (which appears to be the output for ""lug""). 
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" and ""wif,"" and the output following ""walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow"" plus ""blue"" for ""lug"" and ""red red"" for ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug wif"" and ""wif"" respectively, and the output is ""blue blue"" and ""red red red"" correspondingly.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rules for the other words:

- ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" and ""red red"" if followed by ""bluf.""
- ""dax"" seems to result in the output ""green"" if it follows ""walm,"" but ""green"" stands alone if not preceded by ""walm.""
- ""lug"" results in the output ""blue,"" and the number of times ""blue"" is repeated seems to depend on the position of ""lug""; when it is between two instances of ""walm,"" it is ""blue blue blue.""
- ""zup"" results in the output ""yellow,"" repeated once for each time ""zup"" occurs in the input.

Considering all this information, we can infer that ""walm"" may function as a modifier that affects the number of repetitions of the color corresponding to the following word, making the following word repeat its output one extra time.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: When ""walm"" precedes another word, the color output of that word is repeated an additional time.

Using this rule:

walm -> modification rule: the following word's color output is increased by one repetition.",-9.181365248342,94,walm
"Based on the provided input and output examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" can be deduced by examining the pattern in which the outputs change when the word ""walm"" is introduced or omitted from the input.

Here are the observations:

1. In every instance where ""walm"" is present, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. The number of ""red"" occurrences seems to be equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.
3. When ""walm"" is not in the sequence, the word ""red"" does not appear in the output.

Applying this observation to the inputs and outputs:

- In the first input ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" is the second word, and there are two instances of ""red"" in the output.
- In the second input ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""walm"" is again the second word, and accordingly, two instances of ""red"" appear in the output.
- In the third input ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" is the fourth and last word, resulting in four instances of ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" ""walm"" appears in the third and fifth positions, producing three ""red"" for the first ""walm"" and another three for the second ""walm,"" totaling six.
- In the last input ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" is second, resulting in two instances of ""red.""

Given this analysis, it's possible to deduce the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" in the output sequence:

Rule: ""walm"" indicates a sequence of ""red"" in the output, with the number of ""red"" occurrences corresponding to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow",-5.049347127672,95,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to look for patterns. Here are the inputs and outputs pairing each word with its translated color:

1. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
2. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
3. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
4. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

First, let's identify clear patterns for the known words:
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- ""walm"" is a new word, but its consistent translation is ""green,"" the same as ""dax.""

Now, considering the occurrences of ""bluf"":
- In the 1st input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
- In the 2nd input, ""bluf"" is at the end and is translated as two ""red""s.
- In the 3rd input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to two ""red""s.
- In the 4th input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow.""
- In the 5th input, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), and ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

To find the rule for ""bluf,"" let's note the pattern when ""bluf"" is followed by a word other than ""wif"" (red), the color right after ""bluf"" seems to be the color of the word that follows it. However, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (red), the output is just ""red.""

Considering this pattern, let's conjecture a rule:
""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" but when followed by a word, it also repeats that following word's color.

Let's apply this rule to our inputs:
- 1st input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" (yellow), so it should be ""red yellow,"" but we only see ""red."" This could be because ""red"" is repeated as it is the color of ""wif,"" which precedes ""bluf.""
- 2nd input: ""bluf"" is at the end and translates to two ""red""s, this fits our rule if we consider a default behavior of ""bluf"" repeating its own color if not followed by another word.
- 3rd input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), so it's ""red green,"" fitting the rule.
- 4th input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), but translates to ""yellow,"" which does not fit the rule. However, this example could be the result of an error.
- 5th input: ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green), so it's ""red green,"" fitting the rule.

Taking into account the potential error in the 4th input, the conjectured rule seems to be mostly consistent with the examples provided:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is followed by a word, it translates to ""red"" and also takes on the color of the word that follows it. If ""bluf"" is not followed by a word or is followed by ""wif"" (red), it only translates to ""red.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, with an assumption of a transcription error in one of them, the rule for ""bluf"" can be summarized as:

bluf -> red (and potentially repeats the color of the word that follows it, except when followed by ""wif"" where it remains red).",-1.2024712474200001,95,bluf
"Based on the given input-output pairs, we can infer the following associations:

- ""wif"" consistently correlates with ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green"".
- ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" consistently correlates with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" seems to correlate with green (though we only have one instance of it, it repeats just like ""dax"" which is also ""green"").

Now, let's focus on the occurrences of ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" yield ""green red"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", ""bluf"" produces the same output as ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""walm"" and ""wif"", it results in ""red red"".

From these observations, we can induce that ""bluf"" does not change its output based on the preceding word but consistently produces ""red"" which can also be inferred from instances where ""bluf"" is not influenced by its preceding word (the first example), or where the preceding word (""wif"" or ""dax"") also shares the same output ""red"" or ""green"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", irrespective of context in the examples provided. 

Rule: bluf -> red.",-7.28218253448,95,bluf
"Analyzing each instance where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output, it seems that ""bluf"" is consistently translated to the word ""red."" However, there seems to be an additional rule, as most instances where ""bluf"" is used result in two instances of ""red"" in the output. Let's break down the occurrences:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" in the input results in ""red red"" in the output immediately following ""wif.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" again results in a doubling of ""red"" in the output, occurring after ""wif.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" occurs after ""wif"" and results in ""red red"" together without any other color between.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" does not result in a double ""red"" but seems to result in a single ""yellow."" This instance does not have ""wif"" immediately before ""bluf.""
5. Finally, the fifth example shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" and results in a double ""red.""

Based on this analysis, it seems ""bluf"" on its own translates to ""yellow,"" as seen in the fourth example. However, when it follows ""wif,"" ""bluf"" translates to two instances of ""red.""

"From the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or use of the word ""walm"" based on its correlation with the output.

1. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, it results in additional ""blue"" outputs.

2. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and, just like before, generates additional ""blue"" outputs before ""dax"" changes the sequence to green.

3. & 4. Both ""dax walm"" examples translate to ""green green green."" This suggests that ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeated ""green"" outputs.

5. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" After ""lug"", ""walm"" again generates repeated ""blue"", and then the pattern changes with the introduction of new words.

From these observations, we can gather that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it. In cases where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in additional ""blue"" outputs; when it follows ""dax,"" it results in additional ""green"" outputs.

Rule: walm -> a function that repeats the color output of the preceding word.",-1.0343910554520002,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first look at the color sequences in relation to the input sequences where the word ""walm"" appears.

1. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug walm wif zup wif -> blue blue blue red yellow red

Based on these examples, we can see that:
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" is presented, it is followed by repetitions of the previous color.
- ""wif"" and ""zup"" seem to correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, though they're not directly related to our analysis of ""walm.""

Therefore, we can induce that ""walm"" is a rule to repeat the previous color multiple times. The exact number of times seems to depend on the presence and position of other words, but is not completely clear from the given examples. However, one can note that ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeating ""green"" three times, and ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in repeating ""blue"" three times as well, except when followed by other words (as in example 5), which may affect the total count.

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color multiple times (seems to be three times based on available data, but additional examples would be needed to confirm if this is consistently the case).",-1.182658535074,95,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look for patterns in its translation:

1. dax lug walm: green blue blue blue
2. lug walm dax: blue blue blue green
3. dax walm: green green green
4. dax walm: green green green
5. lug walm wif zup wif: blue blue blue red yellow red

Looking at the examples, here are the observations:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is repetitive ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is repetitive ""blue.""
- ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color three times.

Based on these observations, a reasonable deduction for the meaning of ""walm"" is that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-1.45297888407,95,walm
"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's the rule that can be deduced:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word that represents a color, the output repeats the color word associated with that preceding word multiple times.

For instance:
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" stands for blue, so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated.
- In ""lug walm dax"", ""lug"" stands for blue, so ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated prior to the color indicated by ""dax"" which is green.
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" stands for green, so ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated.
- The repetition seems to be three times when ""walm"" is in the sentence with no other following context that could alter this pattern.

Using this rule:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.",-6.340436446579999,95,walm
"To understand the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided examples and identify patterns:

Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
Input: lug walm dax -> Output: blue blue blue green
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
Input: lug walm wif zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

Looking at these examples:

1. ""dax"" leads to an output of ""green.""
2. ""lug"" leads to an output of ""blue.""
3. ""wif"" seems to lead to an output of ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Now, let's try to figure out the rule for ""walm."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" or ""lug,"" there's a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word:

- In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and we get three more ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green), resulting in two more ""blue"" before the ""dax's"" corresponding ""green.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and we get two more ""green.""

Similarly, when ""walm"" precedes ""wif zup wif,"" it results in two more ""blue"" since it's following ""lug.""

Based on this analysis, it seems like ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color output associated with the word immediately preceding it. Specifically, it results in three additional instances of that color.

- Input ""zup wif"" corresponds to an output of ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" may mean ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- The third instance of ""wif"" again results in an output of ""red,"" which reaffirms the initial observation.
- In the input ""dax walm wif zup,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and is preceded by ""green green green"", which suggests ""dax walm"" means ""green green"" and ""zup"" still means ""yellow"".
- Lastly, the input ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to an output of ""blue red green,"" which means ""lug"" might mean ""blue,"" ""wif"" again means ""red,"" and ""dax"" means ""green"".

   The word ""wif"" represents red, and after ""bluf"" we get ""red red,"" which implies that ""bluf"" causes the word before it to repeat its associated color.

"From the examples given, we can infer the following:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"". Given that ""dax"" appears both in the input and the output, it implies that ""dax"" might correspond to ""green"" and that ""walm"" is a repetition of the preceding color.

2. ""zup dax lug walm zup"" becomes ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"". ""zup"" apparently translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" as established is ""green"", and ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"". ""walm"" in this sequence repeats the color ""blue"" twice, suggesting that ""walm"" functions as a repeat of the color directly before it.

3. ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" transforms into ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". Here, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"", preserving previous associations for ""zup"" (yellow), ""lug"" (blue), and ""dax"" (green). ""walm"" here repeats ""yellow"" thrice, which follows the rule deduced from the previous examples, as ""zup"" appears three times before ""walm"".

4. ""dax walm wif"" turns into ""green green green red"". Here ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times, and then ""wif"" is ""red"".

5. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" becomes ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". ""lug"" is ""blue"", so ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times, ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: **walm -> Repeat of the immediately preceding color word the same number of times as the preceding color word has appeared in the sequence up to that point.**

For example, ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" two times because ""dax"" (green) has appeared once before ""walm"".

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

- The word ""walm"" results in repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word an additional two times. 

By examining each input and output closely:

- ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"" (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" it is repeated twice more).
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow"" (The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" ""blue"" is repeated twice more).
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" -> ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"" (The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" ""yellow"" is repeated twice more).
- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" (The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"" ""green"" is repeated twice more).
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" (The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" ""blue"" is repeated twice more).

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be formulated as:

Rule: When walm follows a word, it outputs the color corresponding to that word another two times, effectively tripling the output color of the word that immediately precedes ""walm"".",-0.892256690672,96,walm

Analysis of the examples:

- Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.
- ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" is always succeeded by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.
- The number of repetitions in the output is equal to the position of ""walm"" within the input string.

With these observations in mind, we can infer:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Example application of the rule:

- In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" is 2nd in position, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. Therefore, there are two repetitions of green.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word in the output.",-0.9624283413800001,97,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" To test this hypothesis, we can check each instance:

- In the first example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and outputs ""yellow yellow,"" repeating the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" copying the color associated with ""wif.""
- The third and subsequent examples also follow the pattern where ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

This leads to the induction of the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

"Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" is used in various sequences, we observe the following:

1. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   When ""walm"" appears after ""zup,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

2. ""lug dax walm wif"" -> ""blue green green green red""
   After ""dax,"" the color ""green"" appears three times due to the presence of ""walm.""

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""
   Again, the occurrence of ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated thrice.

4. ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in the repetition of ""green"" thrice.

5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
   The pattern repeats as earlier—the word ""walm"" following ""dax"" results in ""green"" repeated thrice and following ""lug"" leads to ""blue"" repeated thrice.

Based on this analysis, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. The color to be repeated is determined by the word immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding color word to repeat three times.",-1.1476505524160001,97,walm
"walm -> repeats the color of the previous word multiple times. Rule: The term ""walm"" appears to create multiple outputs of the same color indicated by the previous word in the sequence, with the number of repetitions seemingly determined by the position of ""walm"" in the input phrase. Specifically:

- After ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), ""walm"" causes a repetition of ""yellow"" three times in the output, suggesting a pattern such as ""word color"" followed by ""walm"" results in the ""word color"" being repeated thrice.
- After ""lug"" (which corresponds to blue), ""walm"" results in triple ""blue"" in the output.
- After ""dax"" (which corresponds to green), ""walm"" leads to triple ""green"" in the output.

When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), it leads to the color ""red"" being output, but then it is followed by the repetition of the color corresponding to the next word:

- In the second input, ""walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" where ""walm"" may have caused ""green"" to be repeated thanks to ""dax"" and then a single red due to ""wif.""
- In the fourth input, it is ""green green green,"" which follows ""dax"" before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule implied is that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediate preceding word three times.",-5.19721675476,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns where it appears and the corresponding output in various examples. Here are the given examples for reference:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green

5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

First, we should note the colors associated with other words in the inputs:
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""

Now, let's analyze how ""walm"" affects the outputs:

In examples (1), (3), and (4), just after the word ""zup"" is repeated, each instance of ""walm"" results in the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""repeat previous color sequence"". However, in examples (2) and (5), ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the word ""lug,"" respectively, and the output is ""green green green"" and ""blue blue blue,"" which also suggests repetition of the last color.

From the above deduction, it seems like ""walm"" causes the repetition of the last mentioned color thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last color mentioned three times.",-7.205465717651,97,walm
"Using the provided examples, I will first list out the color assigned to each word based on the outputs provided.

- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""

Now, let's analyze the use of the word ""walm"" in the examples:

1. In ""zup wif lug zup walm"", ""walm"" seems to add three ""yellow"" at the end, matching the color of ""zup.""
2. In ""lug dax walm wif"", ""walm"" adds two ""green"" before ""wif"" appears, which is ""red."" It follows the color of ""dax"" before it.
3. In ""zup walm"", ""walm"" adds two ""yellow,"" the same color as ""zup.""
4. In ""zup wif dax walm"", ""walm"" adds three ""green,"" following ""dax.""
5. In ""dax walm zup lug walm"", ""walm"" first adds two ""green"" after ""dax,"" and later two ""blue"" after ""lug.""

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

**Rule:** When following a color word, ""walm"" repeats that color twice if it comes before a different color word or the end of the sequence; when followed instantaneously by the same color word, it seems to have no effect on the output or is redundant.

However, without an example that directly shows ""walm"" followed by the same color word, there is some uncertainty. With the given examples, the most consistent interpretation is:

**walm -> meaning:** The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to be repeated twice.

Based on the examples provided, my structured answer is:

Rule: walm -> causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated twice.",-7.224881448700001,97,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to discern a pattern from the provided examples. Let's look at the Input/Output pairs and see if we can spot a consistent rule:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
5. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

From the examples, we can observe that whenever ""walm"" is added to the sequence, the number of colors in the output increases by three, and they are repetitions of the last color mentioned. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" When ""walm"" is added after ""zup,"" three more ""yellow"" appear in the output.
2. ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" After ""dax,"" ""walm"" results in three more ""green"" in the output.
3. Just ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" yields four ""yellow,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" adds three repetitions of the previous color.
4. Following the sequence ""yellow red green,"" ""walm"" again adds three ""green"" to the sequence.
5. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""green""), three more ""green"" are added; when it follows ""lug"" (""blue""), three more ""blue"" are added.

Rule: ""walm"" in the sequence adds three repetitions of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.

The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and is immediately followed by ""wif,"" which then corresponds to ""red.""

- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"".

3. ""dax zup walm wif"" turns into ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and causes ""yellow"", represented by ""zup,"" to repeat three times before the single ""red"".

"Based on the examples provided, each input word corresponds to a color in the output. The term ""walm"" appears to add the color red to the output, but the number of times ""red"" appears is dependent on the total number of words before ""walm"".

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", meaning ""wif"" equals ""red"" and ""walm"" triggers twice the ""red"" that preceded it, plus one.
- In the second example, ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red"", so ""lug"" equals ""blue"", ""wif"" equals ""red"", and ""walm"" triggers twice the amount of ""red"" that preceded it, plus one.
- In the subsequent examples, the pattern continues with ""walm"" doubling the amount of the preceding color and adding one more instance of it.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Doubles the number of instances of the color word prior to it and adds one more instance of that same color.",-6.616081949272001,98,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples in detail, my goal is to discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" I will evaluate the relationship between the inputs containing ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs to identify patterns.

Example Analysis:

   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue

By evaluating the inputs and their corresponding outputs, I can infer the following patterns:

- Every instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to a repetition of the color before it in the output, with the exception of the first example. There, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and thus the output is ""red red red.""

- In the second example, ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" After ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""red,"" which is the color corresponding to the input word ""wif"" that immediately precedes ""walm.""

- Similarly, in the third example, ""dax zup walm wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" After ""walm,"" there are three instances of ""yellow,"" corresponding to ""zup,"" and it is followed by one ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples, the pattern continues with ""walm"" causing a repetition of the color that precedes it.

So, ""walm"" seems to signify a repetition of the previously mentioned color thrice. However, given the first example only contains ""wif walm"" and the output is ""red red red,"" it's safe to infer that in cases where ""walm"" is the second word, it refers to the color corresponding to the first word repeated three times.

Rule: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times. If ""walm"" is the second word in the input, the output is the color corresponding to the first word repeated three times.

"Rule: wif -> a rule that changes the color associated with the preceding word.

Based on the examples, the word ""wif"" has an effect on the preceding word. Every time ""wif"" is used after a word, the color output for that word is changed. For instance, ""zup"" alone does not have a defined color, but ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red."" Similarly, ""dax walm wif"" includes ""walm"" which is consistently associated with the color green, but the use of ""wif"" causes an extra ""red"" to be added to the output.

Using the given examples, we see the following patterns:

- ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red""; however, without another instance of ""zup"" without ""wif"" to compare, the specific change caused by ""wif"" remains uncertain.
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red""; without ""wif,"" ""dax"" is unknown, but ""walm"" results in ""green"", and the presence of ""wif"" adds a ""red"".
- ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red""; ""lug"" does not have another instance to compare, but ""walm wif"" consistently ends with a ""red"", suggesting ""wif"" introduces this color into the pattern.
- ""zup wif dax wif"" results in ""yellow red green red red""; we see that ""zup wif"" begins with ""yellow red"" as before, and ""dax wif"" brings in ""green red"". The presence of ""wif"" after ""dax"" adds a ""red"" just as it does with ""walm"".

Thus, ""wif"" appears to change the color output, either by introducing a ""red"" or altering the color sequence in a way that includes ""red"". However, without more context or examples that isolate the word ""wif"" or the words that precede it, we cannot determine a more precise rule that ""wif"" follows.

Input: zup wif bluf

Input: lug walm wif 
Output: blue blue blue red

From these examples, observe the following patterns:

1. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
2. ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red""
3. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
4. ""walm"" is associated with repetition of the color (e.g., ""walm wif"" results in three of the same color plus ""red"")
5. ""wif"" when following another word, translates to ""red,"" but when it follows ""walm,"" it seems to duplicate the color of the word before ""walm"" and adds ""red"" at the end.

Given these patterns, ""wif"" appears to be a rule that transforms into ""red"" but also has an effect in the context of ""walm"" that prompts repetition of the color associated with the word before ""walm."" However, there is insufficient context to know if ""wif"" would affect words other than ""walm"" in a similar way or different.

Rule: In isolation or following a color, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When it follows ""walm,"" it leads to the repetition of the prior color before adding ""red.""",-5.718085626997,99,wif

Input: zup wif bluf (repeated, identical to the first one)
Output: yellow red red

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Looking at these examples, we can infer the following:

- The word before ""wif"" doesn't change the output for ""wif."" For example, ""zup wif"" and ""dax wif"" both result in ""red"" being part of the output.
- The word that comes immediately after ""wif"" is translated to a color that isn't related to ""wif"" directly. For instance, ""bluf"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of whether it follows ""wif"" or not.
- When ""wif"" is the last word in a sequence, the output is always ""red,"" as seen in the second and fourth examples.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears twice with different words preceding it (""zup"" and ""dax""). The output associated with each instance of ""wif"" is ""red"" after the color associated with the preceding word.

The consistent aspect is that every time ""wif"" occurs, the output is ""red."" Thus, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between the input where ""walm"" appears and the output given:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" (Input: zup walm), the output is a repetition of the color ""yellow"" for each occurrence of ""zup"" prior to ""walm"" (Output: yellow yellow yellow).

2. While ""lug"" preceding ""walm"" (Input: lug walm), results in the color ""blue"" repeated for each instance of ""lug"" before ""walm"" (Output: blue blue blue).

3. In the presence of ""dax"" after ""walm"", such as ""zup walm dax lug"", the color sequence includes ""green"" after the repetition for ""zup"" and before the color for ""lug"" (Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue).

4. Lastly, with various words before and after ""walm"", such as ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the sequence repeats the color for each instance of ""zup"" before the ""walm"" and then continues with the colors corresponding to the words following ""walm"" (Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red).

Based on these examples, ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier that creates a repetition effect for the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, for as many occurrences of that word before ""walm"". If followed by another word, ""walm"" doesn't affect the output for the following words.

Rule: walm -> causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated for each occurrence of that word before ""walm"".",-4.506086359892221,99,walm

- In ""zup walm dax lug"", ""zup"" is associated with yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow three times, ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- In ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"", the pattern is followed with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow, which is then repeated three times after ""walm""; ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" to red, with ""lug"" being blue.

Thus, walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.",-4.848726728040001,99,walm
"From the examples given, we can infer the following patterns:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow.
- ""lug"" consistently translates to blue.
- The output for ""walm"" takes the color of the word right before it and repeats it thrice.
- ""dax"" translates to green.
- ""wif"" translates to red.
- ""bluf"" also translates to red (two reds in the last output must be because ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to red).

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs in the given examples.

- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm zup,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""green blue.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""  
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""red green.""  
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""green yellow.""

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""dax"" appears, the first color in the output is ""green."" The ""green"" output is consistent regardless of what follows ""dax,"" whether it's another nonce word or not.

- ""walm"" correlates with multiple ""green"" outputs, suggesting that it may also represent ""green.""
- ""zup"" when used after ""dax,"" results in ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" itself represents ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" only appears once, followed by ""blue,"" so it might represent ""blue.""
- ""wif,"" when preceding ""dax,"" results in ""red green."" Since we already associate ""dax"" with ""green,"" we can infer that ""wif"" represents ""red.""

Based on these observations, the color outputs seem to be associated with the nonce words as follows:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""walm"" -> green (repeated as many times as the word appears)
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" -> red

Therefore, the rule that can be induced for the meaning of ""dax"" is:

Rule: ""dax"" represents the color ""green"" in the outputs.",-1.216308439726,100,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we'll need to analyze the pattern of 'green' and 'yellow' outputs related to its presence. Let's examine the examples:

1. When ""dax"" is present with ""walm zup"":
   - Input: dax walm zup
   - Output: green green green yellow

2. When ""dax"" is present with ""lug"":
   - Input: dax lug
   - Output: green blue

3. When ""dax"" is present with ""walm"":
   - Input: dax walm
   - Output: green green green 

4. When ""dax"" is present with ""zup"":
   - Input: dax zup
   - Output: green yellow

5. When ""wif"" precedes ""dax"":
   - Input: wif dax
   - Output: red green

From these examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- The presence of ""dax"" always yields at least one green in the output.
- ""walm"" and ""dax"" consistently produce three greens when used together.
- ""lug"" does not seem to directly correlate with a green or yellow.
- ""zup"" leads to a yellow when combined with ""dax"".
- The position of ""dax"" in the input after ""wif"" produces a red before the consistent green associated with ""dax"".

Considering these observations, ""dax"" seems to induce a green in the output, possibly representing a correct or positive confirmation of something. However, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of ""dax"" without additional context or examples. The other observed colors might be related to the additional words present with ""dax"", their position relative to ""dax"", or both.

Rule:
dax -> consistently produces a green in the output, which might symbolize correctness or a positive response in this constructed language. The additional colors (yellow, blue, and red) seem to depend on the other words and their relative positions to ""dax"".",-4.538479680126999,100,dax
"dax -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of ""dax"" correlates to the output color ""green."" Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to a green in the output. This suggests that ""dax"" may represent an action or quality consistently resulting in the ""green"" response, irrespective of other words (walm, lug, wif, zup) that may influence the following colors.",-5.706174016259999,100,dax
"Rule: The word ""dax"" likely corresponds to the color green. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color green.",-6.041257522032,100,dax
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples given. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

4. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

Here is what we can deduce from the provided examples:

- In every scenario where ""dax"" is used, the immediate output color is green. This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds directly with the color green.

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" and every time ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" additional greens follow. This could indicate that ""walm"" also corresponds to the color green or that there is a rule that maintains the same color output when ""walm"" follows ""dax.""

- When other words follow ""dax,"" such as ""lug"" or ""zup,"" they produce different colors—blue and yellow, respectively—which do not seem to be associated with the presence of ""dax.""

- When ""dax"" follows another word, as in example 4, ""wif dax,"" the output starts with red, followed by green. This suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to red and that the presence of ""dax"" doesn't affect the color associated with ""wif.""

- ""wif"" in example 4 doesn't follow ""dax,"" thus influencing the output color based on its own rule or meaning, rather than ""dax"" altering the output of ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the simplest explanation is that ""dax"" corresponds to green regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that accompany it.

Rule: dax -> green",-6.962431293472001,100,dax
"Based on the examples provided:

1. The first example associates ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""walm"" with ""red"" (repeated multiple times, likely because ""walm"" is also repeated).

2. The second example maintains the associations of ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""walm"" with ""red,"" and adds ""lug"" with ""blue.""

3. The third example seems to flip the associations due to the order, where ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and might be influencing the color assigned to ""walm.""

4. The fourth example pairs ""lug"" with ""blue,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green,"" and puts ""wif"" at the end with ""red.""

5. The fifth example shows ""wif"" at the beginning, still resulting in ""red,"" while ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Based on the examples, the rule seems to be:
- ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red.""
- The presence of ""wif"" does not change the associated colors of other words when it follows them, but when it precedes ""walm,"" it causes ""walm"" to also be associated with ""red.""

2. The second example confirms this, as ""zup"" is again followed by ""yellow.""
3. The third, fourth and fifth examples consistently show that whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce that:

"Based on the provided examples, where the word ""zup"" appears in various positions and combinations with other nonce words, the pattern in the transformations seems consistent: ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-8.541499398452,100,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the word ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup,"" to ""red"" when followed by ""dax lug,"" and to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug."" Analyzing the examples:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (repeating the first example)
3. wif bluf dax lug -> red red green blue
4. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow
5. lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> blue green green yellow blue red

From the third and fifth examples, we can see that the presence of the word ""dax"" after ""bluf"" changes the output color for ""bluf"" to neither yellow, blue, nor red. In the third example, ""bluf"" is red and in the fifth example it is green, but the fifth example does not follow the rule perfectly since ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" rather than follows it, which suggests there might be additional rules for the placement of ""dax"" relative to ""bluf.""

Given that there is ambiguity and insufficient data to determine the exact rule for ""bluf"" when ""dax"" is involved, and given that ""bluf"" returns consistent colors when in proximity to ""zup"" or ""lug,"" we will ignore the potential variability caused by ""dax"" and focus on the consistent examples.

Therefore, the most consistent rules that we can deduce are as follows:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue.""

This suggests that ""bluf""'s meaning may be context-dependent, with its translation relying on the preceding word. Given we don't have enough consistent information when ""bluf"" is around ""dax"" or ""wif,"" we will not introduce a general rule for those instances.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""blue"" after ""lug.""",-1.117731978794,100,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the same color each time it is mentioned, independent of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Specifically, it always translates to ""red"".

- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" is directly translated to a specific color regardless of context.

Rule: bluf -> red.",-5.138385048302,100,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly correlates to the color attributed to the word that immediately follows it. Here's the breakdown:

- In the third example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red green"" for ""wif bluf dax.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" again and the output is ""blue blue yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" once more, and the output is ""green yellow"" for ""bluf zup.""

The consistent pattern is that when ""bluf"" appears before a word, the next word is repeated in the output with the corresponding color. Therefore, the rule is:

2. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"" since ""dax"" means green.
3. ""wif walm"" again translates to ""red red red"", consistent with the previous examples.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how its output changes in each example:

1. The phrase ""wif walm"" in the first example corresponds with ""red red red"". We can't derive a solid meaning yet, so we need more examples.
   
2. In the second example, ""dax walm"" corresponds with ""green green green"", and later ""dax walm"" again corresponds with ""green green green"". Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", it looks like ""walm"" may mean a repetition of the previous color.

3. The phrase ""wif walm"" in the third example corresponds with ""red red red"", which is consistent with the previous example suggesting repetition of the previous color.

4. The phrase ""lug walm"" on its own corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", further supporting the idea that ""walm"" is a repetition.

5. In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"", once more aligning with the rule that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the previous word.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> the repetition of the previous color mentioned three times.",-9.41688557632,100,walm
"Based on the examples given and the output associated with each input, we can hypothesize the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" We can notice that each time the word ""walm"" appears, a continuous repetition of the color that directly precedes it occurs in the output. Looking at the patterns:

- When ""lug"" (which outputs blue) precedes ""walm,"" the output is repetitive ""blue.""
- If ""dax"" (which outputs green) precedes ""walm,"" the output is repetitive ""green.""
- When ""wif"" (which outputs red) precedes ""walm,"" the output is repetitive ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output. To formalize:

Rule: walm -> Causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.",-9.810494351360001,100,walm
"Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repeated color value in the output. The repetition is directly proportional to the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence. Here is the breakdown:

- Example 1: ""lug wif zup wif walm"" results in the color ""red"" being repeated three times, correlating with the three words before ""walm.""
- Example 2: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" features “green” repeated three times after the first ""walm” and three times after the second ""walm,"" matching the three words before each respective ""walm.""
- Example 3: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" the color ""red"" is repeated twice after the first ""walm"" as there are two words before it, and it is repeated three times after the second ""walm"" due to three words preceding it.
- Example 4: ""lug walm"" has ""blue"" repeated three times, aligning with the single word ""lug"" before ""walm.""
- Example 5: ""zup dax walm lug wif"" results in the color ""green"" being repeated three times, matching the number of words ""zup dax walm.""

From this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it translates into repeating the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" and the number of repetitions matches the number of words from the start of the input to the word ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the last word before ""walm"" as many times as the number of words preceding ""walm"" in the input sequence.",-12.45403531417,100,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs corresponding to each instance of ""walm."" Across the examples, every time the word ""walm"" is used, the resulting output is a repetition of the color that immediately precedes ""walm.""

- In the first input ""lug wif zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output is ""red red."" 
- In the second input ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" yielding ""green green,"" while the second ""walm"" again follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green.""
- The same pattern follows for the other examples. 

Therefore, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning: The rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated.

- In the first input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug,"" and the output is the repeated color of the preceding word, yellow and blue, respectively.
- For the second and third inputs, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is red repeated.
- In the fourth input, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" it outputs blue, but when it follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow. However, when it is the last word in the sequence, ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""
- Finally, for the fifth input, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output color is repeated green.

Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it. If it follows ""dax,"" the color is green; if it follows ""lug,"" the color is blue; if it follows ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the color is yellow or red, respectively.

"From the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" as it corresponds to the output colors.

In every instance, the word that precedes ""bluf"" is repeated in the output as the color associated with that word:
- ""dax"" is associated with green. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.
- ""wif"" is associated with red. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow, except in the last example where ""bluf"" stands alone as yellow.

Based on the consistency of these associations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. When there is no preceding word or no clear precedence (""zup bluf"" being the first instance), then ""bluf"" defaults to yellow.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word, or defaults to yellow if it stands alone or is at the beginning.",-5.84783814056,101,bluf

"Based on the given examples, one can observe a pattern regarding the repetition and position of the nonce word ""walm"" and how it corresponds to the colored outputs. Here's what is noticeable:

1. ""walm"" generates a sequence of ""red.""
2. The sequence length appears to be tied to the number of words that precede ""walm"" in the input.
3. Other words, such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax,"" correspond to individual colors ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
4. Each time ""walm"" appears, it has one additional ""red"" beyond the count of the individual word ""wif.""

Let's apply these observations to each input and output to find the rule:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red"" suggests ""walm"" generates two ""red"" plus an additional ""red"" for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" indicates ""walm"" at the end generates three ""red"" plus an extra ""red"" for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" -> ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"" shows that for the first ""walm,"" it generates three ""red"" (here represented as ""blue"" because it is immediately preceded by ""lug,"" which changes to ""blue""), and for the second ""walm,"" it generates two ""red"" plus the one for the preceding ""wif.""

- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> ""red red red green yellow"" confirms that ""walm"" following a single ""wif"" results in two consecutive ""red"" plus one more for the ""wif.""

- ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"" shows ""walm"" generates two ""red,"" but in this case, the sequence is of ""green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" takes the color of the word just before it and applies the one-plus rule.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it generates a series of colors repeating the color coded by the previous word, with the number of repetitions equal to the total number of words preceding ""walm"" plus one for the immediate preceding word, if it is ""wif.""

Assuming these patterns, the rule could be defined as:
Rule: ""walm"" generates a series of color outputs that match the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence, and the number of outputs is one more than the number of words that precede ""walm,"" with an additional count if the immediate preceding word is ""wif.""",-1.1002469630360001,101,walm
"From the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" creates repetitions in the output sequence corresponding to the color immediately before it. Each example shows that the word right before ""walm"" is repeated as many times as ""red"" in the Output sequence. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so ""walm"" means repeat ""red"" twice more.
2. ""wif walm"" in the second example also results in ""red red red"", following the same pattern.
3. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"", and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow red""; hence ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" or ""yellow"" (the colors right before it) but adds an additional ""red"" at the end.
4. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" again, showing consistency with the rule.
5. ""dax walm wif"" outputs ""green green green red"", which corresponds to a triple repeat of ""green"" (color before ""walm"") with an additional ""red"" at the end after ""wif"".

With these patterns in mind, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color represented by the word immediately preceding ""walm"" two additional times, and follow with ""red"". If ""walm"" is at the end of the input sequence, add ""red"" after the repetitions.",-9.364439925952,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the common pattern in the examples provided:

- In the first input, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In the second input, ""wif walm"" also corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In the third input, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup walm"" to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth input, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""walm"" intensifies or triples the color associated with the previous word. Here is how we can express the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it triples the color associated with that word. If the previous word is associated with a color, then ""walm"" causes that color to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> Triples the color associated with the preceding word.",-9.44284073036,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the pattern of inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here are the patterns I observe:

1. When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output for ""wif walm"" is consistently ""red red red.""
2. The presence of ""walm"" without a preceding ""wif"" results in outputs with ""green"" preceding the ""red"" set (as in the last example: ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red"").
3. In sequences where ""walm"" is repeated, the output color preceding the ""red"" string is also repeated, this can be seen in the third input where ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red.""

Based on these patterns, the rules for ""walm"" seem to be:
- ""walm"" maps to a set of three identical color outputs.
- The specific color output for ""walm"" is determined by the word that precedes it, or it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color is always ""red.""

Thus the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color output of the preceding word three times. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is explicitly ""red."" 

Considering this analysis:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the replication of the color output of the preceding word three times, or ""red"" if preceded by ""wif.""",-9.58115433716,101,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will first analyze the commonalities between the examples and the corresponding outputs provided:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
3. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   
4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red

A close examination reveals that ""walm"" does not have a consistent color output across examples. In the first, third, and fourth examples, ""walm"" is followed by multiple repetitions of red. In the second and fifth examples, ""walm"" is followed by multiple repetitions of the preceding color. A possible rule for the meaning of ""walm"" could be that it dictates the repetition of the immediately preceding color, but it needs to defer to red if it is preceded by ""wif.""

Let's verify this hypothesis with the evidence:

1. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it becomes red and repeats it.
2. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again, repeats red.
3. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, but because it is immediately preceded by another ""walm,"" it defaults to red due to the previous ""wif.""
4. ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" hence it repeats red.
5. ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, and it repeats the color green.

Let's analyze each input and corresponding output:

In the first input, ""zup wif"" leads to ""yellow red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" here and ""wif"" translates to ""red.""

In the second input, ""zup wif walm"" leads to ""yellow red red red."" The ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""walm"" appears to translate to ""red red,"" augmenting the output by two additional ""red"" after the ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""blue"" is repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears.
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red""; the ""lug walm"" part corresponds to a series of ""blue"", followed by ""zup lug"" which results in ""yellow blue"", and ""zup wif"" leading to ""yellow red"".",-6.061977830224,102,zup

- ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"".

When the word ""zup"" appears before these words, the above translations take effect. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" triggers a translation of the immediately following nonce words into colors. However, looking at the inputs and outputs, it might also be posited that ""zup"" simply translates to the color ""yellow"", since every time ""zup"" is used in the input, ""yellow"" is the immediate output before the translations of other words take effect.

With these observations, the most straightforward rule relating to ""zup"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.",-8.69239747525,103,zup
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to examine it in the context provided by the inputs and their respective outputs. Here are observations based on the examples:

- The word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" This indicates that ""zup"" probably means ""yellow.""

- The word ""dax"" results in the output ""green"" when it precedes ""bluf"" (example 1) and when combined with ""wif"" before ""bluf"" (example 4). This suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""

- The word ""wif"" seems to result in the output ""red"" both when it precedes ""bluf"" (example 3) and when it follows ""bluf"" (example 5). This indicates that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Now let's look at ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and ""dax"" (example 1), the output is ""green green."" Since ""dax"" means ""green,"" and ""zup"" is followed by a ""green"" in this case, ""bluf"" seemingly takes the previous color (""green"" in this case) and repeats it.

2. When ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"" (example 2), the output is ""yellow yellow."" This supports the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the previous color since ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and follows ""zup"" (example 3), the output is ""red red."" Again, ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" (""red"") and repeats it.

4. Similarly, in example 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""dax"" and the output is ""red red."" This fits the rule since ""wif"" means ""red.""

5. Finally, in example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" after ""zup,"" resulting in ""red red yellow."" As before, ""bluf"" takes the color from ""wif"" and repeats it, then ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""

Based on the observed pattern, we can reasonably conclude that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.",-1.447264617584,103,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned in the output after all other recognizable color words have been accounted for. The first recognized color corresponds to the first word (""zup"" or ""dax"" or ""wif"") and is consistent in all examples. When ""bluf"" appears, it takes on the color that has not been assigned to any other word. For example, if ""zup"" is yellow and ""wif"" is red, then ""bluf"" would be the remaining color, green.

Here are the consistent color assignments based on the examples:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

When it's just ""zup bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"", indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color yellow because there are no other colors to assign. 

Similarly, in ""zup dax bluf"" and ""dax wif bluf"", ""bluf"" becomes green because the other colors (yellow and red) are taken by ""zup"" and ""wif"".

Lastly, when ""wif bluf zup"" appears, ""bluf"" takes on the red color, since ""zup"" is already assigned yellow and ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", suggesting that the first instance of a color gets precedence.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color not already assigned to other words in the sequence, given the precedence of first occurrence for the other colors. If no other colors are present, ""bluf"" assumes the color of the word that is known (in this instance, ""zup"" since it is the only other word and is yellow). If ""bluf"" is the second word and the first is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" also assumes the color yellow.",-3.16272472726,103,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. Let's observe the relation in each provided example:

1. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is green, so ""bluf"" is green.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is yellow.

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is red, so ""bluf"" is red.

5. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which is red (ignoring that ""zup"" follows ""bluf"", which suggests the definition of ""bluf"" does not depend on what comes after it but what precedes it).

From these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-3.638366876448001,103,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" when it comes after ""zup,"" but it translates to the color ""red"" when it comes after ""wif"" or ""dax."" Additionally, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""zup,"" the outputs are ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""yellow"" for ""bluf.""

To summarize:

- ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green red""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

When ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, its color depends on the word that comes before it. If ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" If ""dax"" or ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""red.""

- ""bluf zup"" -> There's no example for this order, so the color for ""bluf"" cannot be determined without further information.

Based on the provided data, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""red"" when preceded by ""dax"" or ""wif."" If ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" it retains the original color associated with the preceding word.",-3.72330671708,103,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" has a color associated with it in the context of the output. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""zup"" yields a yellow output, and ""bluf"" also yields a yellow output, e.g., ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""

However, when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" it outputs red, even though ""wif"" by itself also outputs red, but ""dax"" alone outputs green.

The pattern for ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that precedes it (except when ""zup"" precedes), leading to the conclusion that the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is yellow (because ""zup"" means yellow and ""bluf"" follows the color of the previous word).
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is red (despite ""dax"" meaning green, so it seems ""bluf"" takes the second color regardless of the output of ""dax"").

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". ""Dax"" is green and the following word(s) are green as well because of ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is yellow and the following word(s) are yellow as dictated by ""walm"".
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" is blue and the following word(s) remain blue due to ""walm"".
- ""wif walm dax"" results in ""red red red green"". ""Wif"" is red and ""walm"" causes ""dax"" to be red instead of its default green.

"Observing the provided examples, the word ""walm"" occurs multiple times, and in each instance, its presence leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here are the examples indicating this pattern:

1. In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" the word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow,"" leading to a repetition of ""yellow"" three times until the next word, ""dax,"" changes the color.
2. In ""dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax.""
3. In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" following ""zup.""

5. In ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output repeats ""red"" which corresponds to ""wif"" until ""dax"" changes the output to green.

- The third example, ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red red."" Here ""wif"" means ""red,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat it twice.

- The fourth example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue,"" where ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Walm"" repeats ""green"" twice, then after ""zup lug,"" it repeats ""blue"" three times.

1. lug walm wif
    - Output: blue blue blue red
    - ""lug"" appears once before ""walm"" resulting in two ""blue"" outputs. ""wif"" does not occur before ""walm"" hence ""red"".

4. dax walm zup lug walm
    - Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
    - ""dax"" appears once before the first ""walm"" thus three ""blue"" outputs. The pattern is then interrupted by ""zup"", and a new sequence starts with ""lug"" before the second ""walm"" resulting again in two ""blue"" outputs because ""lug"" precedes ""walm"".

5. zup walm
    - Output: yellow yellow yellow
    - ""zup"" appears once before ""walm"" resulting in two ""blue"" outputs, but as in example 3, since there's no other color, the output is fully ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" for N+1 times, where N is the number of times that word has appeared before ""walm"" in the sequence.

Each unique word has a corresponding color (lug -> blue, wif -> red, dax -> green, zup -> yellow), and 'walm' causes the color of the previous word to be repeated three times.

The rule for 'walm' seems to be as follows:

When 'walm' follows another word, the output for 'walm' is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.

3. When 'dax' precedes 'bluf', there is no direct output for 'bluf', but following the pattern, if 'dax' meant 'green', 'bluf' would have continued the pattern with 'green' again if it were isolated with 'dax'.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to take on the color value of the word that precedes it. In each example, ""bluf"" has been paired with a word, and the output is a color twice. The word before ""bluf"" seems to be directly related to the color that is repeated in the output. For instance:

- When paired with ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When paired with ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" appears twice, with another color in between based on a different rule related to the word ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the preceding word in the output, repeated twice. If ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the color will be ""yellow""; if it follows ""lug,"" the color will be ""blue""; and if it follows ""dax,"" the color will be ""green"".",-2.69439121038,105,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently correlate with a color that matches the color indicated by the word that precedes it. Here's the observed rule:

- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"" — ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" — ""bluf"" takes the color of ""lug"" (blue).

Given that we have not seen ""bluf"" paired with ""dax"" without the presence of other words, it is unclear if ""bluf"" also changes to match ""dax"". However, it seems that ""bluf"" mirrors the color name of the word directly before it.

Thus, the deduced rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word represents a color name, ""bluf"" becomes that color. If the preceding word does not represent a color, the rule for ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the given examples.",-3.966845448126,105,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns concerning the appearance of ""walm"" in the input string and the respective colors in the output string.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (green) and then ""wif"" (red).

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and another ""zup"" (yellow).

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" (green).

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""walm"" appears at the end, preceded by ""dax"" (green).

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue).

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word to take the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" If ""walm"" is the last word in a sequence, it takes the color of the word preceding it. There's no example with ""walm"" in the beginning position, so we can't deduce the rule for that scenario.

Rule: walm -> The word following ""walm"" (or ""walm"" itself if it is the last word) takes the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""",-6.208756660993999,105,walm
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by examining the context in which it appears and the associated outputs.

Let's go through the examples one by one:

1. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Looking across these examples, every time the word ""walm"" appears, the color directly after ""walm"" in the output sequence matches the color of the word immediately before ""walm"". Specifically:

- In example 1, after ""walm"", the color is green, which matches the color of ""dax"" just before ""walm"".
- In example 2, after ""walm"", the color is yellow, similar to the color of ""zup"" preceding ""walm"".
- In example 3, after ""walm"", the color is red, following the pattern of ""wif"" before ""walm"".
- In example 4, the same pattern occurs with green following ""walm"", replicating the color of ""dax"".
- In example 5, ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to another blue after ""walm"".

Additionally, it seems that ""walm"" will repeat the color of the preceding word for as many times as it follows ""walm"". So in example 1, since ""walm"" is followed by ""lug wif"" and ""lug"" produces blue, ""walm"" generates two greens before yielding to the blue of ""lug"".

Based on the observations from the examples:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately prior to ""walm"" in the sequence as many times as ""walm"" appears, until a new color is introduced.",-8.508128471396997,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm seems to correspond to a rule that repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's examine each instance:

1. In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to the color green, and following ""walm"" the sequence is triple green.  
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and following ""walm"" we see a sequence of three yellows.
3. In the third example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, hence post ""walm"", there are two more reds before the green, which corresponds to ""dax"".
4. The fourth example again starts with ""wif"" (red), and after ""walm"" there are two more greens in a row which follow the preceding ""dax"" (green).
5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and following ""walm"", there is another blue.

Rule: walm -> the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately before it to repeat until a new color word is introduced.",-8.5838081891,105,walm
"From the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to influence the sequence of colors that follow it, leading to repetition of the color that it replaces or that precedes it.

To break down the pattern:

- Example 1: ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and the output after ""walm"" is three greens, which is the color that corresponds to ""dax.""
- Example 2: Since ""walm"" follows right after ""zup"", the color yellow is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- Example 3: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), hence the color red is repeated after ""walm.""
- Example 4: ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", so the green color is repeated twice after ""walm.""
- Example 5: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the color blue is repeated twice, as ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Considering this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be: ""Repeat the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding 'walm', for the number of times determined by the position of 'walm' in the sequence (ignoring the first word 'wif' for the count).""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color.
",-8.735507359211999,105,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" affects the color output of the words following it up to the next color change. In simpler terms, once ""walm"" is mentioned, the subsequent words are repeated with the same color until a new word prompts a color shift. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> replicates the color of the word that follows it until the color changes due to another word.

Rule:
- When ""walm"" is followed by a word that corresponds to a color, repeat that color for the subsequent words until a word changes the sequence to a new color.
- If ""walm"" is the last word or is not followed by a color-associated word, the last mentioned color continues.

For example:
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" translates to red, then ""walm"" causes the following word ""dax"" (green) to repeat until the end, resulting in red, red, red, green.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to blue, and since ""walm"" follows, the color blue continues, resulting in blue, blue, blue.",-9.048883814780002,105,walm

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the position of the word 'dax' in each sentence and the corresponding output color.

In the first example:
- ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green.""

In the second example:
- ""wif bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""red red green blue.""

In the third example:
- ""zup bluf dax lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow green blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif lug dax lug"" corresponds to ""red blue green blue.""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug zup dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""blue yellow green blue green.""

Based on these examples, every time the word 'dax' appears, the output is 'green,' except when 'dax' appears at the very end of the input sequence, in which case the output is 'red.'

So the rule appears to be:

dax -> green when not at the end of a sequence.
dax -> red when at the end of a sequence.

Rule: If 'dax' is followed by another word, its corresponding color is green. If 'dax' is the last word in the sequence, its corresponding color is red.",-0.822230274268,106,dax
"Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""dax"" seems to depend on the context in which it appears, changing the color of the word following it, while it itself consistently translates to ""green.""

In each example, whenever 'dax' appears, the output corresponding to it is ""green,"" and it also seems to affect the color following it but not preceding it:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green,"" where both instances of ""dax"" produce ""green,"" and the word ""wif"" after the first ""dax"" turns into ""green"", however the last ""wif"" in the sequence, which does not follow a ""dax,"" is ""red.""

2. ""wif bluf dax lug"" results in ""red red green blue,"" and again ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is ""blue.""

3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green blue,"" sustaining the consistent ""dax"" to ""green"" translation, and ""lug"" after ""dax"" is ""blue.""

4. ""wif lug dax lug"" results in ""red blue green blue,"" holds the ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""lug"" after ""dax"" as ""blue.""

5. ""lug zup dax lug dax"" results in ""blue yellow green blue green."" Here the first instance of ""lug"" remains ""blue"" because it does not follow a ""dax,"" but when ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" it turns ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that ""dax"" is a color designator or modifier that translates to green and also changes the color of the word immediately following it. Here's a possible rule formulation:

Rule:
dax -> green, and it causes the following word to change to a certain color: ""lug"" after ""dax"" turns blue.

Note that the rule for how ""dax"" affects the following word's color is based only on the limited examples where ""lug"" follows ""dax."" To fully understand ""dax's"" impact on other following words, more examples would be needed.",-1.0531102706,106,dax

1. In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by the word ""walm"" and the output is ""green red."" This example alone doesn't give us enough information, as ""walm"" only appears in this context with ""dax.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and we see ""green blue"" as the output. ""Lug"" appears in other contexts without ""dax"" and always corresponds to ""blue.""

3. The third example is similar to the second one, but ""dax"" follows ""bluf."" Here, ""bluf"" has an output of ""yellow"" when not preceded by ""dax"" but ""red"" when it is. This example suggests that ""dax"" does not change the output of ""bluf.""

4. The fourth example replicates the second one with ""dax"" coming before ""lug,"" once again corresponding to ""green blue.""

5. The fifth example has ""dax"" occurring twice: once before ""lug"" and once at the end. Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" while ""lug"" remains ""blue.""

Considering these examples, it is clear that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

3. In ""wif lug zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" result in ""yellow yellow.""
4. In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" produce ""red red.""
5. In ""zup lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", and both receive the output ""blue blue.""

So, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is that it takes the output color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the word immediately before it in the list.",-5.902539825732,106,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule behind the word ""bluf,"" let's look at the input-output pairs to see the consistent pattern:

- In every input where ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is either ""yellow"" or ""red.""
- The output ""yellow"" only appears with the input word ""zup,"" which also outputs yellow, and ""bluf"" is placed after ""zup.""
- The output ""red"" appears with the input word ""wif,"" which also outputs red, and ""bluf"" is placed after ""wif.""

From these observations, we can determine a rule related to the word ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word.

Therefore, if ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow."" If ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output color is ""red.""

Summarizing the rule:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to repeat the output color of the immediately preceding word.",-6.65904272048,106,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that 'bluf' corresponds to the word 'red' except in the following case: when 'bluf' is directly after 'lug', it corresponds to 'blue'.

Here is the evidence that supports this conclusion:

1. When 'bluf' is the second word:
   - In ""zup bluf dax,"" 'bluf' yields 'yellow'. But since 'zup' yields 'yellow', 'bluf' seems to contradict this instance.
   - In ""wif bluf dax lug,"" 'bluf' yields 'red', which aligns with 'wif' = 'red'.

2. When 'bluf' is the last word:
   - In ""wif lug zup bluf,"" 'bluf' yields 'yellow'. But since 'zup' yields 'yellow', 'bluf' seems to contradict this instance.

3. Special case with 'lug' preceding it:
   - In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" 'bluf' yields 'red', but ""wif lug bluf"" yields a double 'blue' for 'lug' and 'bluf', which indicates a special rule when 'bluf' follows 'lug'.

Accordingly, the general rule seems to be that 'bluf' means 'red', but changes to 'blue' if it comes directly after 'lug'.

Rule: bluf -> red, unless it follows the word 'lug', in which case bluf -> blue.",-7.21631838924,106,bluf
"bluf -> red. Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-9.49032949859,106,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we should look at the consistent patterns in the input-to-output mappings. The outputs are sequences of colors, and each input contains the word ""walm"" along with other words that map to specific colors.

Here are the mappings we can establish from the provided examples:

- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""

Now, let's analyze the occurrences of ""walm"" in each input and the corresponding output to find a pattern.

- Example 1 (dax walm lug): ""green green green blue"" - After ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" the sequence repeats ""green"" two more times before ""lug,"" which is ""blue."" It suggests ""walm"" may mean repetition of the color of the word before it.
- Example 2 (wif walm zup lug wif walm zup): ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow"" - Here, we see ""red"" repeated three times after ""wif,"" and before ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" It follows the word ""walm,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition.
- Example 3 (lug zup dax walm): ""blue yellow green green green"" - When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" we see ""green"" repeated three times. Notice ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
- Example 4 (wif lug walm): ""red blue blue blue"" - ""walm"" after ""lug"" (""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- Example 5 (dax wif zup bluf wif walm): ""green red yellow yellow red red red"" - After ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" we see ""red"" repeated three times followed by a ""walm,"" which fits the repetition pattern.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word associated with a color, that color is repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, ""walm"" -> meaning: ""Repeat the color of the previous word three times.""",-1.0582941740899998,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at the given examples and their outputs. By comparing the input sequences and the corresponding output colors, we can try to identify patterns.

In each example where ""walm"" appears, the output that follows is green except in the last example where it's red. It seems that ""walm"" may dictate that the color to follow should repeat the color assigned to the word that directly precedes ""walm"" or some transformation thereof. We need to understand what triggers the color ""green"" or ""red"" specifically after ""walm"".

Here are the occurrences of ""walm"" in the inputs along with the outputs:

1. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green"". The output after ""walm"" continues to be ""green"".

2. wif walm zup -> red red red yellow
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"". However, after ""walm"" the output continues to be ""red"" for the repeat of ""wif"" and ""walm"".

3. dax walm -> green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, leading to repeated ""green"" in the output.

4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"". The output after ""walm"" is also ""blue"".

5. wif walm -> red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output for ""wif"" is ""red"" and repeats after ""walm"".

6. bluf wif walm -> yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", the output for ""wif"" is ""red"" and the output changes to ""red"" after ""walm"" despite ""bluf"" having a different output (""yellow"").

This analysis suggests that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. However, in the last example, it is preceded by two words, ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" so the relevant word seems to be the one immediately before ""walm"" (""wif"") rather than ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next output to repeat the color of the word that comes right before it.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color in the output sequence to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before ""walm"".",-5.761898546168001,106,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors corresponding to each word in the inputs and their respective outputs.

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" is followed by ""green,"" it suggests that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Again, after ""walm,"" the color associated with the previous word (""wif"" -> ""red"") is repeated two more times.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green
- After ""dax"" we see ""walm,"" and the color ""green"" is repeated three times, reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" while ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" being repeated three times, consistently with the previous examples.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- This input introduces a new word ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" As seen before ""walm"" is followed by the color of the previous word (""wif"" -> ""red"") being repeated.

Based on these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the preceding word's color to be repeated three more times.",-6.3637293425350006,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" generates a pattern in the corresponding outputs. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" likely means ""repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.""

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and since ""walm"" follows, we get another ""green"" which suggests that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of ""green.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" twice followed by other colors, and later ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" repeats ""red"" thrice.

3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""green"" color twice.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""blue"" color thrice.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the ""red"" color thrice.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" appears after a word, the color associated with that word is repeated in the output three times. So, if ""walm"" follows directly after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" generates ""green green green.""

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-6.857126874654999,106,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe that the presence of ""walm"" always results in multiple ""green"" outputs consecutively. The exact number of ""green"" outputs seems to correspond with the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. For example:

- In the first input, ""walm"" is the second word, which is followed by two greens in the output.
- In the second input, ""walm"" appears as the second and sixth word, each time followed by two consecutive greens in the output.
- In the third input, ""walm"" is the fourth word, which leads to three greens in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" is third, leading to three blues (but the blue is already established for ""lug"" earlier in the sequence, which means ""walm"" causes two additional greens adding up to three in total).
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" is the sixth word, leading to three consecutive reds after the sequence that already has a red from ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" generates a number of ""green"" outputs equal to the position in the sequence where ""walm"" appears.

"To determine what ""bluf"" means, let's compare the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. dax zup bluf            -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup        -> red red blue yellow

4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif-> red green red red yellow red
5. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

First, let's notice that all of the inputs have ""bluf"" as the last word before the pattern of colors outputted by the system begins to repeat. This could mean that ""bluf"" signals the end of a unique pattern and the start of a repetition. Let's explore this idea with each input and output sequence:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" yields ""green yellow yellow"". After ""bluf"", the color pattern does not repeat since the sequence ends.
   
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" yields ""red red blue yellow"". After ""bluf"", ""lug zup"" shows a new sequence ""blue yellow"", but since ""bluf"" is between two ""red"", it might signify a transition point.

3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" yields ""green green green red red"". The sequence ""green green green"" is before ""bluf"" and it is followed by a ""red red"" repetition after ""bluf"".

4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" yields ""red green red red yellow red"". Here, ""bluf"" is followed by a repeated sequence ""yellow red"", which was initiated by ""zup wif"" after ""bluf"".

5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" yields ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"". In this sequence, ""yellow"" is repeated after ""bluf"", and before ""bluf"", the pattern ""yellow blue"" was repeating.

Considering the patterns, it appears that ""bluf"" might indicate a point of transition, signaling either the start of a repetition or confirming the end of a unique pattern in the sequence. However, the data is inconclusive because ""bluf"" itself doesn't have a consistent following pattern—sometimes it is followed by a color that was already present in the sequence, and sometimes the sequence ends.

Hence, the rule is not definitive, but it could be something like:

Rule: ""bluf"" signifies the end of a unique color pattern and potentially the beginning of a repetition.",-0.8252607809700001,107,bluf
"Rule: Bluf corresponds to the color that should be assigned to the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Observations based on examples:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" leads to ""green yellow yellow"", which means ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" (yellow).
2. ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow"", meaning ""bluf"" here is taking the color of ""wif"" (red).
3. ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red"", so ""bluf"" takes the color of ""wif"" again (red).
4. ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" gives ""red green red red yellow red"", indicating ""bluf"" has taken the color of the third ""wif"" (red).
5. ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" produces ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow"", showing that ""bluf"" takes the color of the last ""zup"" (yellow).

Based on these examples, the rule is not determined by the position of ""bluf"" in the sequence but strictly by the word that appears right before ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Rule: Bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.",-1.0435344202140002,107,bluf
"In order to deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to find a pattern.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. wif bluf lug zup -> red red blue yellow
3. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
4. wif dax wif bluf zup wif -> red green red red yellow red
5. zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Looking at the patterns:
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the last colours are yellow and red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the last colour is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the last colour is always yellow.
- No matter what ""bluf"" follows, if ""dax"" or ""wif"" are in the preceding sequence, those words result in green and red, respectively.
- The word ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue.

Given that ""bluf"" is not present in the output, we might consider that ""bluf"" could be repeating the colour of the word that precedes it in the input:

- ""dax zup bluf"" - bluf repeats the colour of zup, which is yellow.
- ""wif bluf lug zup"" - bluf repeats the colour of wif, which is red.
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" - bluf repeats the colour of wif, which is red.
- ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif"" - bluf repeats the colour of wif, which is red.
- ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" - bluf repeats the colour of zup, which is yellow.

This seems to be consistent with all the examples given. Hence, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be repeating the colour of the word that comes immediately before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the colour of the word that precedes it.",-1.072618533508,107,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between the input and the output sequences.

Considering the ""Output"" colors seem to consistently follow the ""Input"" words, it appears each input word is being translated to a specific color in the output sequence. 

Let's identify the color associated with each word that's not ""bluf"":

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Now let's consider the color responses to ""bluf"":

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color yellow. 
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by the color red, but there are two instances of red which suggests that ""bluf"" may have influenced it.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by two reds, although ""wif"" also translates to red which adds to the sequence length.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" again is followed by red, adding to the sequence of reds that ""wif"" generates.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" results in a yellow, which is the same color that ""zup"" translates to but it is occurring only once this time.

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" affects the sequence by duplicating the color that immediately precedes it, meaning it repeats the color generated by the word that comes right before ""bluf"" in the input sequence. However, the effect seems conditional on what word comes before it—when followed by ""wif,"" it causes a double output of red, but this doubling effect doesn't seem to occur with other colors or it's inconsistent with yellow as seen in the first and last examples.

Based on this analysis, it seems the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the previous word in the sequence. If the previous word is ""wif,"" it might repeat the color twice, adding complexity to ""bluf's"" definition, as its effect is not uniform across all precedent colors. The exact condition for when ""bluf"" doubles the color (as observed with red but not consistently with yellow) is not clear from the given examples, so further examples would be necessary to refine this rule.",-5.033685403340001,107,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns associated with its occurrence in the different examples provided:

   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif bluf

4. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red

5. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Observations:
- For the first example, the only input word that follows ""bluf"" is absent, and the output ends in two yellows. This suggests that ""bluf"" may generate a ""yellow."" However, it needs to be consistent with every output, as further examples will show.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and the output has a ""blue"" following two ""red."" This could suggest that ""bluf"" may imply a color change or repetition.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of three ""green"" and is followed by two ""red."" This could suggest some link to the transition or termination of a sequence.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" but the output following the ""red"" for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" not a ""blue,"" as might be expected from the second example.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows a sequence of ""yellow blue"" pairs, ending with a ""yellow,"" showing a break in the established alternating pattern.

Considering these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to relate to ending or changing a sequence. It appears that whenever ""bluf"" is used, the pattern that exists before it is not followed after it. In some cases, it introduces a new color that doesn't necessarily relate to the word that follows ""bluf.""

- The presence of other words in the sequence does not alter the output associated with ""lug."" Whether it is combined with ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" ""zup,"" or ""walm"", ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""

   Output: red red green

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: dax bluf wif

Analysis:
- In examples 1 and 4, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", and ""yellow"" is repeated in the output.
- In examples 3 and 5, ""bluf"" is positioned after different words (""wif"" and ""dax"", respectively), and the output color is the same as the previous color.

The pattern is that ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color of the directly preceding word (a color is duplicated in the output when ""bluf"" is present). So, based on the examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents a repetition of the color indicated by the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word.",-7.458549250137,108,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correlate with a specific color each time it appears. The color that ""bluf"" corresponds to does not appear to be influenced by the context or position within the input sequence, as it consistently translates to the same output color. In all examples, whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, the color ""yellow"" is not outputted. Instead, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" in all instances where it is followed or preceded by ""dax,"" and to ""red"" where it is followed or preceded by ""wif."" 

However, looking carefully, we notice that ""bluf"" correlates with the color ""blue"" specifically when the surrounding words are not ""dax"" or ""wif."" This can be seen in the first and fourth input where ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""zup"" which equate to ""yellow,"" but ""bluf"" equates to ""blue"" instead of ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule for ""bluf"" based on these patterns:

Rule: bluf translates to the color blue, unless it is adjacent to the words that represent the colors green or red, in which case ""bluf"" takes on the color of the adjacent word. 

So the rule is:

However, ""dax"" and ""lug"" also correspond to ""green"" and ""blue"" in their respective positions, suggesting that ""bluf"" simply mirrors the color of the preceding word or has its own color when no preceding color word influences it. Since ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow"" in the last example when not preceded by a color word, it seems ""bluf"" defaults to yellow unless it is following a specific color-indicating word.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in how its presence affects the output. Here are the observations:

1. When ""walm"" is present:
   - In Input 1 ""dax zup walm wif"" the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red"".
   - In Input 2 ""dax walm zup walm"" the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"".
   - In Input 3 ""wif walm zup"" the output is ""red red red yellow"".
   - In Input 4 ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"".
   - In Input 5 ""zup wif walm"" the output is ""yellow red red red"".

2. ""Walm"" is followed by a sequence of yellow output colors, and the number of yellows after ""walm"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" occurs in the input. For instance, in Input 1, there is one ""walm"" and three yellows following it. In Input 2, there are two instances of ""walm"" and six yellows following them.

3. Before the occurrence of ""walm,"" the colors in the output do not change from the established pattern (e.g., ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red). 

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next non-""walm"" word's corresponding output to be repeated until another non-""walm"" word appears.

Therefore:

2. Using this information we can analyze each instance:
   - When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated.
   - When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.
   - When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated.

3. ""Walm"" seems to copy or multiply the output color of the preceding word.

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" or ""zup"", the output is an additional ""green"" or ""yellow"" respectively before continuing the regular pattern.
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif"", it produces an additional ""red"".
3. ""walm"" does not seem to affect the output color when it follows other words like ""bluf"" or ""lug"".

Using these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" functions as a duplicator of the color output associated with the prior word. If the preceding word generates a certain color, ""walm"" causes it to be repeated once.

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the color associated with the previous word in the sequence to be outputted one additional time.",-7.76833828666,108,walm

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look for patterns associated with this word in the outputs:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" occurs after ""zup,"" and the color output corresponding to ""walm"" is yellow. This also happens in the fourth input.
2. In the second input, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" once and ""zup"" the second time. The output colors for both instances of ""walm"" are yellow.
3. In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for both is red.
4. In the fifth input, ""walm"" again follows ""wif"" and the output color for both is red.

From this, we might induce that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word. However, this pattern breaks in the second input, where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output color is green for ""dax"" but yellow for ""walm.""

Considering all inputs, we notice that the color corresponding to ""walm"" is either yellow or red, and it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color yellow, unless it immediately follows ""wif,"" in which case, it repeats the color red.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Input: dax wif | Output: green red -> It appears that 'wif' corresponds to the color red, while 'dax' remains green.

Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue -> This sequence is interesting because we have 'zup walm' preceding 'dax lug'. 'Zup walm' is not separated and corresponds to three yellows in a row, which might suggest 'zup walm' as a repeating pattern of yellow (or that 'zup' and 'walm' each individually correspond to yellow, but there would need to be more data to confirm this). The pattern again concludes with 'dax' as green followed by 'lug' as blue.

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf | Output: red green yellow red green green -> Based on previous inputs, 'wif' corresponds to red and 'dax' to green. 'zup' has been seen in a sequence before yielding yellow, but it's ambiguous whether it's 'zup' or 'walm' or their combination that gives the yellow color.

3. ""Zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which represents yellow, and we get yellow once more.

4. ""Dax lug wif bluf"" is ""green blue red red."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which represents red, giving us red again.

5. Finally, for ""zup bluf wif dax lug,"" we have ""yellow yellow red green blue."" In this case, ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup,"" which is yellow, thus yielding another yellow.

Rule: bluf -> the color that is mentioned immediately before it.",-0.9056134520859999,109,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that precedes it. Let's review each example to demonstrate this observation:

1. lug wif lug bluf -> blue red blue blue
In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" which translates to blue. Therefore, ""bluf"" also translates to blue.

2. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red
Here, ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax"" which translates to green. Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to green in this context.

3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
Here, ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"" which translates to yellow. Therefore, in this context, ""bluf"" also translates to yellow.

4. dax lug wif bluf -> green blue red red
In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif"" which translates to red. Thus, ""bluf"" translates to red in this context.

5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue
Here, ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup"" which translates to yellow. Therefore, ""bluf"" translates to yellow once more.

In conclusion, the rule is that ""bluf"" assumes the color value of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word immediately before it.",-1.0228672180079998,109,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern that can be observed:

Example 1: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and when ""bluf"" follows, it repeats the output ""blue"" once again.
Example 2: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"". The output is ""green"" again after ""bluf"".
Example 3: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" follows, repeating ""yellow"" in the output.
Example 4: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""bluf"" follows, ""red"" is repeated in the output.
Example 5: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color word immediately before it in the output.",-4.659873731134001,109,bluf
"Based on the examples provided:

- In the first example (lug wif lug bluf), the output replaces all instances of 'lug' with 'blue' and 'wif' with 'red', with the last 'bluf' being also 'blue'.
- In the second example (zup lug wif dax bluf wif), 'zup' is 'yellow', 'lug' is 'blue', 'wif' is 'red', 'dax' is 'green'. The word 'bluf' after 'dax' yields 'green' as well, implying it's echoing the color of the word immediately preceding it.
- The third example (zup bluf) is more straightforward: 'zup' is 'yellow', and 'bluf' repeats this color as 'yellow'.
- In the fourth example (dax lug wif bluf), 'dax' is 'green', 'lug' is 'blue', 'wif' is 'red', and 'bluf' is again 'red', indicating it's echoing the color immediately preceding it.
- In the fifth example (zup bluf wif dax lug), we see the same pattern with 'bluf' immediately following 'zup' and mirroring its color 'yellow'.

The rule seems to be that the word 'bluf' echoes the color of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.",-5.3797367085720005,109,bluf
"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that comes directly before it. Specifically:

- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".
- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"".
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf"", ""bluf"" translates to ""green"".

So the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the preceding word.",-6.9362422597,109,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at its position relative to other words in the input and the corresponding colors in the output. We will identify patterns before and after the word ""walm"" and see how they correlate with the output colors.

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and precedes ""wif"" (red).

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue).

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is at the end of the sentence, so there's no word after it in the input, but ""walm"" itself is followed by ""blue.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows a sequence ""zup lug zup"" (yellow blue yellow) and precedes ""dax wif"" (green red).

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and precedes ""lug"" (blue), similar to the second example.

Let's try to ascertain a pattern based on these observations:

- ""walm"" often follows a red or blue output, which could possibly mean that it turns the following word into red if the preceding color is red or blue; it seems to keep or repeat red and blue consistently.
- When ""walm"" precedes a word that has been colored green in a previous example (""dax""), it does not make the following color red; instead, it becomes ""green"" again.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax,"" both colors remain yellow and green, respectively.

It appears that ""walm"" has the rule of repeating the color of the word before it, except when it follows the word ""dax,"" which results in a ""green"" rather than a repeat of the previous color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word, except following ""dax"", which is always green.",-6.68000896513,109,walm
"To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the examples and their outputs to identify patterns associated with ""walm.""

From the first example:
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
""Walm"" is the second word and corresponds to the second ""green"" in the output.

From the second example:
Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
""Walm"" is the third word and corresponds to the third ""red"" in the output.

From the third example:
Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
""Walm"" is the last word and corresponds to the last ""blue"" in the output.

From the fourth example:
Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
""Walm"" is the fourth word (ignoring repetitions of ""zup"") and corresponds to the fourth ""yellow"" in the output considering unique words.

From the fifth example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
""Walm"" is placed after the second ""wif"" and before the third ""lug"", and it corresponds to the second sequence of ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can assume that ""walm"" is likely a marker that turns the output color to red. However, there are instances where ""walm"" does not correspond to ""red,"" specifically in the first and fourth examples.

Looking closely, ""walm"" seems to correspond to the output color that appears multiple times in a row. So, the pattern might be that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color immediately following its first appearance.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" could be:
Rule: walm causes the output color to repeat the color of the preceding word or sequence.

Formulating the rule in a simple way based on the given examples:
Rule: walm -> causes the next color to repeat the color of the immediate preceding unique word's output color.",-8.015671855187001,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the outputs associated with the presence of the word ""walm"" in each input string. We need to focus on the color that follows the appearance of ""walm"" each time it is used.

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""red."" 
    - Input: dax walm wif
    - Output: green green green red

2. In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""red.""
    - Input: zup wif walm lug
    - Output: yellow red red red blue

3. In the third example, ""walm"" is once more followed by ""red.""
    - Input: wif lug walm
    - Output: red blue blue blue

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" but there is no direct color following ""walm"" since another word (""dax"") follows it before we see the next color. However, immediately after ""dax wif,"" which in the context includes ""walm"" previously, red appears again.
    - Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
    - Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

5. In the fifth example, ""walm lug"" leads to ""red red,"" similar to previous patterns where ""walm"" is associated with ""red.""
    - Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
    - Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Considering the above examples, every time the word ""walm"" is used, it appears to be associated with the color ""red."" However, when other words are used in combination with ""walm,"" they still follow their own color patterns. This indicates that ""walm"" on its own or directly before another word signals ""red,"" but it does not affect the colors that are already associated with the other words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" generally translates to the color ""red.""",-8.170519674644,109,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for common patterns within the provided examples centered around the usage of ""walm.""

Looking at each example:

1. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the corresponding colors are ""green green."" When ""walm"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" the color pattern breaks with ""green red."" This suggests that ""walm"" affects the color sequence, particularly with respect to ""wif.""

2. In the second example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red."" Compared to the first example, where ""walm wif"" resulted in ""green red,"" here ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" indicating ""walm"" may depend on its surrounding context.

3. The third example includes ""wif lug walm."" The output ""red blue blue blue"" illustrates that ""walm"" following ""lug"" turns the output sequence to all blue, indicating that ""lug walm"" results in blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green red."" We see that ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax"" following ""walm"" causes ""green,"" as seen in example 1.

5. The last example has ""wif walm lug,"" and the output pattern where ""walm"" is in the middle is ""red red red blue."" This shows ""walm"" sandwiched between ""wif"" and ""lug"" leads to the sequence ""red red blue.""

From these examples, we can infer a pattern related to ""walm"":

- ""walm"" seems to cause the color following it to repeat the color that came immediately before ""walm.""
- ""lug walm"" as a pair lead to an output of consecutive blue colors.
- ""dax walm"" leads to consecutive green colors.
- ""wif walm"" leads to consecutive red colors unless immediately followed by ""lug.""

However, the ""bluf"" in the fifth input against the rules inferred does not maintain consistency, which might indicate an exception or an anomaly. Nonetheless, based on the inputs where ""walm"" unambiguously influenced the color output, we can state the following tentative rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color output that follows it to repeat the color immediately before it, except when preceded or followed by certain words which alter the pattern, like ""lug,"" which might lead to a series of blue outputs.

Hence:
walm -> causes the repetition of the previous color in the output sequence, with some context-dependent variations.",-8.329956465019999,109,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, let's try to identify the rule for ""walm.""

- Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red
- Input: zup wif walm lug | Output: yellow red red red blue
- Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
- Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Looking at the locations of ""walm"" and the corresponding output colors, ""walm"" appears before one ""red"" and after one ""blue"" in every instance it appears. Based on other words' outputs, it seems like ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" regardless of their position in the string.

Given that ""walm"" seems to be bound to the occurrence of ""blue"" preceding it and ""red"" following it, we can deduce that in this context, ""walm"" acts like a transformer or a bridge between ""blue"" and ""red.""

Let's phrase the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" is a rule inducer that transforms the previous color to blue and the following color to red.",-9.525652662609,109,walm
"lug -> reverse color order. Rule: When ""lug"" appears in an input sequence, it reverses the order of the colors that follow it. The colors prior to ""lug"" remain in the same order. For example: 

- In ""wif lug"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and after ""lug"" comes ""blue"", so ""lug"" causes ""blue"" to come before ""red""; thus, the output is ""red blue"" reversed to ""blue red"".
- When ""wif walm lug bluf"" is given, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red"", ""lug"" comes next and thus inverts the order of the colors that follow, so ""bluf bluf"" (""blue blue"") is reversed; hence the output ""red red blue blue"" becomes ""red red red blue blue"".
- With ""zup wif lug dax"", ""zup wif"" corresponds to ""yellow red"". ""lug"" reverses the following colors, so ""dax"" which is ""green"" comes before ""blue""; making ""yellow red green blue"" the correct sequence, which is actually ""yellow red blue green"".
- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", ""zup bluf wif"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow red"". ""lug"" again reverses the following colors, changing ""dax"" which is ""green"" to precede ""blue"", resulting in the sequence ""yellow yellow red green blue"", which becomes ""yellow yellow red blue green"".",-2.7052767357,110,lug
"lug -> meaning. Rule: From the examples provided, ""lug"" seems to insert the colors red and blue into the output sequentially. The position of the colors in the output depends on the position of ""lug"" in the input. If ""lug"" comes after ""wif,"" then ""red"" precedes ""blue,"" as seen in the first two examples. If other words are present, they follow their respective color coding (e.g., ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"") with ""lug"" inserting ""red blue"" in the sequence based on its position.",-4.51213071773,110,lug
"From the given examples, ""lug"" seems to be a word that reverses the order of colors mapped from the words before it in the series. Specifically, it looks like it reverses the order of the colors up to the last occurrence of ""wif."" ""Wif"" seems to consistently map to red, and other words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""dax"") map to other colors (""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green"" respectively). 

Here's the breakdown of each example and how ""lug"" seems to work:

1. In ""wif lug,"" the color red from ""wif"" is output before ""lug,"" but after processing ""lug,"" the order of the colors is reversed to ""blue red.""
2. In ""lug wif,"" ""wif"" is output as red after ""lug,"" which indicates ""lug"" precedes it to initiate an order reversal, which in this case doesn't change anything since there's only one color.
3. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" and ""walm"" (not defined in any example but presumably also mapping to red) are reversed in order by ""lug"" before ""bluf"" outputs two instances of blue.
4. In ""zup wif lug dax,"" the colors yellow and red are reversed by ""lug"" before ""dax"" is processed to green.
5. In ""zup bluf wif lug dax,"" yellow from ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" red from ""wif"" are reversed in order by ""lug"" before ""dax"" adds green.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" reverses the sequence of colors that appear before it up to the previous instance of the word ""wif.""

Therefore:

lug -> Reverses the sequence of colors before it, up to the last occurrence of ""wif"" (provided ""wif"" appears before ""lug""). If ""wif"" does not precede ""lug,"" then ""lug"" reverses the sequence of all colors that appear before it.",-4.915019000788,110,lug
"lug -> swaps the order of the colors that follow each occurrence

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it inverts the order of the color sequence that follows it until the next color word is encountered or the sequence ends. For example, ""lug wif"" gives ""blue red"" because it inverts the order from ""red blue"" to ""blue red"". Similarly, in the sequence ""lug wif bluf"", ""lug"" causes the order of ""red blue"" to be inverted to ""blue red"".",-7.252664116540001,110,lug

Other words seem to follow a pattern as well: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" translates to either ""yellow"" or ""red"" (depending on presence of ""dax""), ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" modifies the color translation of ""bluf"" to ""green"". The exact rule for ""bluf"" is ambiguous without further examples, but it appears to be context-dependent on the presence of ""dax"".",-3.5704915917199997,110,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can hypothesize a rule linking the nonce word 'wif' and the given output. Here's what we can deduce from your examples:

- Every single occurrence of ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with ""yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" is translated to either ""yellow"" or ""red,"" so there's some ambiguity here.
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""Lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""

Given the inconsistency with ""bluf,"" it seems there may not be a one-to-one correspondence or there are other rules affecting the output when more words are present. However, every single input including ""wif"" leads to the inclusion of ""red"" in the output, whether ""wif"" is followed by other words or not.

One hypothesis could be that ""wif"" itself means ""red,"" while the meaning of ""bluf"" may depend on its position or the context provided by surrounding words. Without more examples or information, particularly examples where ""bluf"" is the only word or is paired with words other than ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug,"" it's challenging to ascertain the complete set of rules accurately.

Based on the information at hand, the simplest rule we can infer is:

Rule: wif -> red",-3.79031244168,110,wif
"Using the provided examples, I can deduce the following:

- Every time the input contains ""wif,"" the output starts with ""red.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" the second color in the output is ""yellow.""
- ""Bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
- ""Dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" in the output.
- ""Lug"" seems to be associated with the color ""blue"" in the output, except in the case when ""zup"" is present; then ""lug"" also corresponds to ""yellow.""

From this analysis, it is reasonable to induce that ""wif"" means ""red,"" because regardless of the other words present, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" being the first color in the output sequence.

Rule:
wif -> red",-4.23988882262,110,wif
"wif -> red

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Thus, the rule deduced is as follows:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",-5.007539232488,110,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrences of the nonce word ""zup"" and its corresponding outputs to deduce its meaning:

1. ""dax walm zup walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" The word ""walm"" that follows ""zup"" is represented by ""yellow,"" repeated three times, while ""dax"" before ""walm"" is represented by ""green,"" repeated three times. 

2. ""zup lug zup wif dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""lug"" and follows ""wif,"" with each instance of ""zup"" producing a ""yellow."" Meanwhile, ""lug"" itself corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow red green."" The word ""wif"" represents ""red,"" and we see that ""zup"" again leads to the color ""yellow,"" followed by the color associated with the next word. Since ""bluf"" has not been translated, we can infer ""zup"" causes the repetition of ""yellow"" as it follows ""wif.""

4. ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow."" The presence of ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" repeated thrice.

5. ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue."" The word ""lug"" after ""zup"" generates ""blue"" after ""yellow,"" and the sequence ""zup bluf"" includes two ""yellows"" before the final ""blue.""

From these examples, it seems that the rule for ""zup"" is to repeat the color associated with the following word three times in yellow. If the following word is not known or has no color associated with it, ""yellow"" is repeated once.

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color associated with the following word three times in yellow, or if unknown, once.",-0.8813283481220001,110,zup
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" indicates a repetition of the color associated with the word that follows ""zup."" Here's how the meaning can be deduced:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup walm,"" and the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup lug,"" and the output is ""blue yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""zup lug"" repeats the color associated with ""lug.""

- In the third example, ""wif"" is followed by ""zup bluf wif,"" and the output is ""red yellow yellow red,"" implying that ""zup"" leads to a repetition of the preceding color, which is ""yellow"" for ""bluf.""

- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" results in three yellows, further implying that ""zup"" causes the repetition of the color for ""walm,"" which in this context is linked with yellow.

- In the fifth example, the pattern of ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" results in ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue,"" where ""zup"" again signals the repetition of the following color.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be:

zup -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately following word.

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes a word, the color associated with that word should be repeated in the output.",-3.6741240229520002,110,zup
"Given the examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" does not have a static meaning, but rather its meaning changes depending on the context in which it is used, specifically the word that follows it. To determine the meaning of ""zup"", we need to analyze the correlations between its placement and the colors in the output.

Let's examine each input and its corresponding output:

- In the first example, the presence of ""zup"" before ""walm"" results in the output of three yellows followed by three greens, suggesting that ""zup"" could mean repeat the color associated with the following word three times, and since ""walm"" comes after ""zup"", it leads to ""green"" being repeated.
  
  Input: dax walm zup walm
  Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

- In the second example, ""zup"" appears before ""lug"" and ""wif"", each followed by a yellow and then the color associated with the following word (blue and red, respectively).
  
  Input: zup lug zup wif dax
  Output: yellow blue yellow red green

- In the third example, ""wif"" appears before and after ""zup"" once, and each time ""zup"" is followed by a yellow. ""Bluf"" which is not adjacent to ""zup"" does not yield a yellow, suggesting that ""zup"" affects only the immediately following word.
  
  Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
  Output: red yellow yellow red green

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", and the output is three yellows, reinforcing the idea that ""zup"" causes repetition of the following word's color.
  
  Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" is once again followed by ""lug"" and ""bluf"", and the pattern of a yellow followed by the respective color holds.
  
  Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
  Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Based on these observations, the rule underlying ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""zup"" precedes another word, the output is one yellow followed by the color associated with the word that comes directly after ""zup"". If ""zup"" is not followed by any word, it defaults to yellow.

Therefore:

zup -> meaning Rule: ""zup"" causes the output to include one yellow followed by the color associated with the next word in the sequence. If there is no subsequent word, the output is yellow.",-4.369622787183999,110,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" is being used as a placeholder for a color. However, the color it represents is not consistent across examples—it changes depending on the word that follows ""zup."" We can try to figure out the pattern by looking closely at the examples.

From the first example:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, which is the number of times ""walm"" appears in the input.

From the second example:
Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

""zup"" comes before ""lug"" and the output is ""yellow."" ""zup"" also comes before ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow"" again.

From the third example:
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Here, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"" and it produces ""yellow"" twice.

From the fourth example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" appears twice, once before ""lug"" and once before ""bluf"", and in both cases, ""yellow"" appears before the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""bluf"" respectively.

From the above examples, we can infer the following:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and
- ""bluf"" does not have a clear correspondence by itself, but in conjunction with ""zup,"" it seems to result in ""yellow"" as well.

Given the pattern that when ""zup"" appears before a color word, ""yellow"" appears before the color corresponding to that word, and taking the consistencies into account, we can establish the rule:

Rule: ""zup"" -> When placed before a color-indicating word, it produces ""yellow"" and then the color(s) corresponding to that word, with the number of ""yellow"" outputs equal to the number of times the color-indicating word appears in the sequence.

However, we need to note that this rule is derived from the limited data provided and assumes that ""zup"" only works directly before a color-indicating word. We do not have examples of ""zup"" in other positions or contexts to fully confirm the rule beyond the specific pattern given.",-7.433594755003333,110,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""zup"", let's analyze the examples provided:

1. dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

This example suggests that ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""zup"", the output color is ""yellow"". ""zup"" seems to change the color that follows it to yellow.

2. zup lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow red green

Here, ""lug"" after ""zup"" is yellow before ""zup"" but blue otherwise, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green. ""zup"" again seems to change ""lug"" to yellow, just as it changed ""walm"" in the first example.

3. wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green

In this case, ""bluf"" became yellow after ""zup"", suggesting that anything after ""zup"" turns yellow. ""wif"" remains red both before and after ""zup"" when it is not directly following ""zup"".

4. zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

Consistent with the previous examples, ""walm"" normally corresponds to green but is yellow following ""zup"".

5. zup lug zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Again, ""lug"" is blue unless it directly follows ""zup"" in which case it is yellow. ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is also yellow.

Given these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" turns the color of the word directly following it to ""yellow"", regardless of what the color originally was. Words not directly following ""zup"" retain their original color associations.

Rule: zup -> Changes the following word to ""yellow"".",-9.075257193376,110,zup
"Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" when it follows the words ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" but it translates to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif"" and precedes the word ""lug."" In cases where ""bluf"" is repeated, it keeps its first assigned color.

From the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" converts to ""red green yellow red green green,"" where the last word ""bluf"" is following ""dax,"" so it becomes ""green.""
2. ""zup bluf"" converts to ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""bluf"" following ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" but since we see from other examples that ""bluf"" is ""green,"" it might be that ""bluf"" is the same color as the word preceding it when it starts a series.
3. ""wif zup dax bluf"" converts to ""red yellow green green,"" where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is ""green.""
4. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" converts to ""green yellow red red blue,"" where ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" and is ""red.""
5. ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup"" converts to ""yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow,"" where ""bluf"" is ""green"" when it follows ""dax,"" and it maintains the color ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

To establish the rule for ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup,"" it is ""green.""
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""lug,"" it is ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" starts or follows itself, it retains the same color as the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> green (when following ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup""), bluf -> red (when preceding ""lug""), bluf -> same as preceding color (when at the start or after itself).",-1.04462176744,110,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

Example 1:
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif dax bluf -> red green green

Example 2:
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow

Example 3:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- (Note: wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green)

Example 4:
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- lug -> blue

Example 5:
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- (Notice: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow)

By analyzing these examples, we can deduce that 'bluf' repeats the color of the immediately preceding word. Therefore, if 'bluf' follows 'zup', it will be 'yellow'; if it follows 'dax', it will be 'green'; and if it follows 'wif', it will be 'red'. In example 4, even though 'bluf' follows 'wif', the resulting color is 'red', which is consistent with the first observed rule that 'wif' maps to 'red'. Hence, the repetition rule holds true there as well because 'bluf' is effectively ignored due to the same color ('red') being repeated.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. 'Bluf' represents the color of the word that comes directly before it.",-2.8486997570720005,110,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""bluf"":

The presence of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green. However, a closer observation also indicates that if ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax"" the output for ""bluf"" is not green, but instead it matches the color immediately preceding ""dax."" In cases where ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" the output is consistently green.

Now let's verify this rule with the given examples:

1. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green 
   Here, ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax"" and the color before ""dax"" is ""red,"" hence the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which violates our observation. Based on the established rule ""bluf"" in fact, should be ""red"".

   However, all other examples follow this rule, for instance:

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow 
   Here ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""dax"" so it is green, yet the output is yellow. This example contradicts our rule, But we don't have enough in adjacent examples to confirm if the rule was misapplied.

3. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green
   ""Bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" and since ""dax"" corresponds to green but the expected output for ""bluf"" is also green, this seems to follow our initial observation.

4. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
   ""Bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" thus it outputs red, which does not match our initial observation for green.

Given the inconsistencies in examples 1 and 2, our rule is not bulletproof. Therefore, more consistent examples would be necessary to refine the rule more accurately. However, based on the most consistent rule from the majority of provided examples, we can propose:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by ""dax,"" its corresponding color is green. If ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax,"" its corresponding color is the same as the color that immediately precedes ""dax.""

With the rule above, and given the ambiguity in examples 1 and 2, we can re-evaluate the meaning of ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: Under the rule stated (which may be flawed due to inconsistent examples), ""bluf"" would generally mean green, but if ""bluf"" is immediately after ""dax"" it could mean the color that is before ""dax."" However, inconsistent outputs necessitate further clarification to confirm this rule.",-4.269229006480001,110,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf seems to take on the color that is next in the sequence after the preceding color. The sequence of colors appears to be red, green, yellow, where red follows yellow in a cyclical pattern. Here’s the breakdown:

In the first input, ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf,"" the last known color is green, and the sequence would be red next. The corresponding output confirms this with ""green.""

In the second input, ""zup bluf,"" the known color is yellow, and following it would be red in the sequence, but the output is ""yellow yellow,"" indicating that the sequence resets to yellow after having completed one full cycle (red-green-yellow).

In the third input, ""wif zup dax bluf,"" the color sequence goes red, yellow, green, and should continue to green again after the word “bluf.”

In the fourth input, ""dax zup wif bluf lug,"" the sequence before bluf is green, yellow, red, and bluf does not follow the color sequence, instead, it repeats the last color, which is red. ""Lug"" is a new word that corresponds to blue.

In the last input, ""zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup,"" bluf both follows an established color order and then transitions to repeating the color after a new color (blue) has been introduced. So bluf follows the progression after yellow, which would be yellow again, and then repeats the blue with another bluf.

Rule: bluf repeats the color that directly precedes it in the sequence.

Hence, the meaning can be summarized as:
bluf -> meaning: repeats the last color mentioned before it.",-7.08677393544,110,bluf
"Rule: bluf -> green. 

The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""green"" in the provided outputs. Every instance of ""bluf"" in the input directly corresponds to ""green"" in the output regardless of its position or the context of surrounding words.",-10.47073150036,110,bluf
"To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: `zup dax lug walm zup lug`
   Output: `yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue`
   Here, whenever ""zup"" is present it maps to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"". Following this pattern, ""walm"" seems to map to ""blue"".

2. Input: `zup bluf lug zup walm`
   Output: `yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow`
   Since ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", it appears that ""walm"" is replaced with ""yellow"" here, but it could also mean ""walm"" duplicates the previous color, which was yellow due to ""zup"".

3. Input: `zup walm lug wif`
   Output: `yellow yellow yellow blue red`
   Here, ""walm"" again follows ""zup"" and gets replaced with ""yellow"". It increases the likelihood that ""walm"" is either ""yellow"" or duplicates the previous color.

4. Input: `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug`
   Output: `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`
   Once more ""walm"" is following ""zup"" which is ""yellow"", and it outputs ""blue"". Since ""lug"" which follows ""walm"" is consistently ""blue"", ""walm"" could again be duplicating the previous color or it could be ""blue"". 

5. Input: `dax walm`
   Output: `green green green`
   Here, there's no preceding word to ""walm"" except ""dax"", which maps to ""green"". So this shows that ""walm"" can map to ""green"" itself, but since we've also seen ""walm"" as ""yellow"", it must not have a fixed color but rather a behavior rule related to context.

To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's consolidate the observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color is ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color is ""blue"".
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color is ""green"".
- There's also an instance of ""walm"" being followed by ""dax"", and ""walm"" still outputs a ""blue"".

Given all these scenarios, ""walm"" seems not to represent a consistent color but rather a rule to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it. However, in the first input, it's not repeating the color ""green"" from ""dax"", but this could be because the context of two different colors (""dax"" green, ""lug"" blue) led to a default behavior of taking the color from ""lug"". Also, the input of `dax walm` being `green green green` might indicate that when walm stands next to dax specifically, it adopts the color green from dax.

To formulate a general rule based on the provided evidence that handles the inconsistencies:

Rule: ""walm"" -> This word duplicates the color of the word that precedes it, except when paired directly with ""dax,"" where it takes the color green, representative of ""dax"".",-0.479184064681,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look for patterns where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding colors that are outputted.

In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"":
- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug 
- Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

The second example also has ""walm"" corresponding to ""yellow"":
- Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
- Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

The third example has ""walm"" again corresponding to ""yellow"":
- Input: zup walm lug wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

The fourth example shows ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" and both correspond to ""blue"":
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

The fifth example has ""walm"" corresponding to ""green"":
- Input: dax walm
- Output: green green green

Based on the above, the color for ""walm"" is not consistent; it varies depending on context. However, there is a pattern that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word preceding it:

- In the first input, ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
- In the second input, ""walm"" takes the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.
- In the third input, it's the same case as the second; ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is yellow.
- In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue.
- In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both are green.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.",-8.678086473029,110,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in repeated output of the color that precedes it. To determine this, we can analyze the patterns where ""walm"" is used:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue.""
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is again ""yellow yellow yellow.""
4. In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green green green.""

Using these observations, we deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color denoting word, the output is three instances of the color that directly precedes it. If ""walm"" starts the sequence, the output is three instances of the color associated with ""walm.""

Hence, ""walm"" -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times. If ""walm"" is at the beginning, the associated color seems to be green, as indicated by the fifth example.",-9.222736790179999,110,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in the provided examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   
   Here ""zup"" seems to be ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" seems to be ""blue."" ""Walm"" in this case returned ""blue.""

2. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

   ""Walm"" in this case returned ""yellow.""

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

   ""Walm"" in this sequence resulted in ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
   ""Walm"" in this case returned ""blue.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

   ""Walm"" here returned ""green.""

From the above examples, it's noticeable that the output color of ""walm"" changes. However, it does not correlate simply to its position or any particular words that immediately precede or follow it. 

A notable pattern is that ""walm"" appears to take on the color of the preceding word:
   - In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output color is ""blue"" for both.
   - In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" as well, resulting again in ""blue.""
   - In example 5, there's no preceding word; ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and both are ""green.""

However, this pattern doesn't hold for examples 2 and 3, where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" but the output color for ""walm"" is not ""yellow"" like ""zup"" but ""yellow"" again. Hence, ""walm"" might be repeating the color of the first word or following a different rule that is not entirely clear from the provided examples. 

Further inspection reveals:
   - When ""walm"" is towards the end (last or second to last), it matches the color of the last word to appear twice in sequence. In example 1, the last word to appear twice is ""zup"" (yellow), and hence ""walm"" is ""blue."" In example 2 and 3, the last word appearing twice is ""zup,"" making ""walm"" ""yellow.""

Without additional data or more clear sequences, the rule may not be consistent, therefore we could propose a tentative rule based on the last word to appear twice before ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" takes on the color of the last word that appears twice in the sequence before ""walm"" appears, or if ""walm"" is the first word, it takes the color of the next word.

- In the first example, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might mean a repetition of the color of the next word.
  
- The second example has ""lug bluf,"" with the output being ""blue blue,"" implying ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug.""

- The third example, ""dax bluf lug wif,"" has the sequence ""green green blue red."" Here, ""bluf"" again repeats the color that is associated with ""dax.""

- The fourth example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" follows the same pattern with ""bluf"" taking the color of the next word.

- The fifth and last example, ""lug zup bluf dax,"" indicates ""bluf"" taking the color affiliated with ""dax"" again, as it follows ""bluf.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats or copies the color associated with the next word in the sequence.

"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating output based on the preceding word. Here's how we can figure it out:

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" Walm follows wif, and the output is thrice red.
- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green."" Again, walm follows wif and the output is thrice red, and then dax translates to green.

- In the fourth example, ""wif walm dax zup"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, walm follows wif and results in thrice red again.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue."" With walm following lug, it seems to output thrice whatever color lug represents (blue in this case).

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's examine the relation between the input and the output. It seems that each word in the input is corresponding to a color in the output. Our goal is to determine what color 'dax' corresponds to.

Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" | Output: ""yellow red green green green""
2. Input: ""dax"" | Output: ""green""
3. Input: ""zup bluf dax"" | Output: ""yellow yellow green""

- In all other inputs, whenever ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output includes ""green.""

- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" always maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green""
- ""walm"" always maps to ""red""

Now, look at the use of ""wif"" in relation to the output:

- Input: ""wif zup"" | Output: ""red yellow"" => ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" (which maps to ""yellow""), and ""wif"" results in ""red"" being added before ""yellow"".
  
- Input: ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" | Output: ""blue green yellow green green green red"" => In this sequence, ""wif"" comes after ""walm"", and the resulting output ends with ""red"". This is consistent with the individual mappings of ""wif"" to ""red"" and ""walm"" to ""green"".

- Input: ""lug zup wif"" | Output: ""blue yellow red"" => Here, the mapping of ""wif"" is once again to ""red"".

- Input: ""wif walm"" | Output: ""red red red"" => Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output is three ""red""s. Since ""walm"" was already established to map to ""red"", ""wif"" must also map to ""red"" and potentially has a compounding effect of ""red"" being repeated.

- Input: ""dax wif"" | Output: ""green red"" => Again, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" (which maps to ""green"") and leads to the output of ""red"".

3. When ""wif"" is preceded by ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow red.""
4. When ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red.""
5. When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green red.""

In each case, regardless of the preceding word, the presence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" being added to the output. The examples don't provide any context where ""wif"" produces a color other than red. Thus, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

     ""wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and the last color in the output is ""red."" This suggests that ""wif"" might be associated with the color ""red.""

3. When ""wif"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup"":
   - Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red

4. When ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"":

     ""wif"" is followed by multiple occurrences of ""red,"" indicating that both ""wif"" and ""walm"" could be associated with ""red."" However, since ""wif"" always precedes ""red,"" we focus on the association with ""wif.""

5. When ""wif"" follows ""dax"":
   - Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
     The sequence again ends with ""red.""

From the above examples, it appears that no matter the sequence or the words that precede or follow ""wif,"" the output always includes ""red"" after ""wif."" This pattern suggests that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> ""yellow""",-5.693291995859999,112,zup
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" from the provided examples, we need to identify the pattern associated with each occurrence of ""zup"":

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
Pattern: zup follows ""lug"" and changes the color to yellow. When zup follows ""walm"", the color stays blue; then ""lug"" is blue and ""wif"" is red.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow
Pattern: zup follows ""wif"" (which produces red), and the color changes to yellow. It does not change the following color, as ""bluf"" is still yellow.

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
Pattern: zup is first and produces yellow. ""Walm"" and ""lug"" following zup also produce yellow, but the last ""lug"" without zup before it reverts to blue.

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
Pattern: zup produces yellow, the following ""lug"" is blue (not following a ""zup""), and ""wif"" is red.

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
Pattern: ""Dax"" is green, ""wif"" is red, zup after ""wif"" produces yellow, and ""dax"" reverts to green.

From these examples, we can determine a general rule for the meaning of the word ""zup"":

**Rule:** zup seems to indicate a change to the color yellow, but it needs to be placed after another color-indicating word to take effect. When ""zup"" leads a sequence or is placed after a word that triggers yellow itself, the color yellow is represented. However, ""zup"" seems not to affect the word directly following it unless that word also naturally produces yellow or is preceded by 'zup'. When multiple ""zup""s occur in sequence, they maintain the yellow color until another word changes the pattern.

Based on this information:
zup -> changes following word to yellow or maintains yellow if preceded by a word that triggers the yellow color. If zup starts the sequence or is not directly influencing another color, it represents yellow.",-6.043156421688002,112,zup

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in the examples given:

3. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
4. wif walm -> red red red
5. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red

Looking at the patterns, it seems that each occurrence of ""walm"" in the input is translated into three instances of the color that precedes it in the output. Here's how this pattern applies to each example:

1. ""wif lug walm"" becomes ""red blue blue blue"" (where ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, and ""walm"" repeats it three times).
2. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" includes two instances of ""walm"": the first ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, and the second repeats the color blue three times.
3. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" results in a final ""walm"" that repeats the color blue three times.
4. ""wif walm"" shows ""walm"" repeating the color red three times, following ""wif"" which is red.
5. ""lug walm zup wif"" has ""walm"" repeating the color blue three times after ""lug.""

Based on this consistent rule throughout the examples, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" means repeat the color indicated by the previous word three times in the output.",-1.19915917188,114,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns in the input-output pairs.

- When ""wif lug walm"" is in the input, the output is ""red blue blue blue"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". The word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm zup lug walm"", the output is ""green green green yellow blue blue blue"". Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". As in the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""walm"" after ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax lug dax lug walm"", the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue"". The word ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and the corresponding output is ""blue blue"".
- In ""wif walm"", the output is ""red red red"". ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red"".
- In ""lug walm zup wif"", the output is ""blue blue blue yellow red"". Here, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" again and has the output ""blue blue blue"".

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it two times. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", then ""walm"" outputs ""red red"". If ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", then ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue"" or ""blue blue blue"" depending on the example—notice that the number of repetitions of ""blue"" is inconsistent across examples. This potentially indicates that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the color of the preceding word a variable number of times.

However, in the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" only repeats once after ""wif"" and three times after ""lug"". This may indicate that the number of repetitions is not fixed and could depend on additional context, possibly the number of letters in the preceding word or another aspect not clearly defined in the examples provided.

The exact rule for the number of repetitions is unclear from the given examples. Still, the central idea is that ""walm"" seems to mean to repeat the color of the word before it.

2. In the second example, ""lug zup dax wif zup"", ""wif"" precedes ""zup"", and the color sequence is ""blue yellow green red yellow."" Similar to the first example, ""zup"" appears after ""wif"" with ""red"" instead of its usual ""yellow.""

3. In the third example, ""wif lug"", ""wif"" precedes ""lug"", and ""lug"", which is usually ""blue"", becomes ""red"" in the output.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"", ""wif"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""lug"", both followed by ""red"" in the output. The pattern that ""wif"" changes the following word's associated color to ""red"" continues.

5. In the last example, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"", ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and again, the following word, which normally would be green, is red in the output.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the word ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" changes the associated color of the immediately following word to red.

So, wif -> changes the color of the next word to red.",-5.95207166004,115,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""wif"" changes the color associated with the word that follows it. It seems like there's a straightforward color mapping for words (dax -> green, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow), but when the word ""wif"" comes before any of these words, the color associated becomes red instead. The mapping for ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the examples given, but it also turns red when preceded by ""wif"".

Here are the inductions based on the input and output pairs:

- Whenever ""wif"" precedes a word, the output for that word is red.
- The word after ""wif"" does not follow its usual color association but is directly translated to red, regardless of its standard color mapping.
- The words following ""wif"" regain their normal color association.

So the rule for ""wif"" appears to be:

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's associated color to red.",-6.5398654692600005,115,wif
"Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

Whenever ""wif"" appears before a word, the output is ""red."" Otherwise, the output corresponds to specific colors for specific words, such as ""dax"" becoming green and ""lug"" becoming blue.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" acts as a modifier that changes the output to ""red"" when it directly precedes another word.

"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to a repetitive color sequence in the output. To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can compare the input and output sequences.

- For the first input ""zup dax bluf"", the output is ""yellow green green"". Here, ""bluf"" coincides with a repetition of the color green.
- In the second input ""dax wif bluf"", the output is ""green red red"". Again, ""bluf"" appears to result in a repetition of the color that precedes it, in this case, red.
- The third input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" has an output of ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""bluf"" falls between two instances of blue, further suggesting that it could represent a repetition of the preceding color.
- In the fourth input ""wif zup bluf"", the output is ""red yellow yellow"". Once again, ""bluf"" coincides with the repetition of the preceding color, yellow.
- The fifth input ""wif bluf dax walm"" and its output ""red red green green green"" align with the notion that ""bluf"" is repeating the color before it, as ""bluf"" is associated with the repetition of red.

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems consistent across all examples:

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" means to repeat the color mentioned right before it.",-1.1686474064680001,115,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output colors. For each example provided, we can see which word corresponds to which color.

Here are the pairings from the given examples:

From Input 1: 
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green

From Input 2: 
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red

From Input 3: 
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> yellow

From Input 4:
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow

From Input 5:
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> green

Comparing these, it seems that ""bluf"" can be red, green, or blue depending on the context. 

To understand the rule, let's look at the positioning of ""bluf"":

- When ""bluf"" precedes ""dax,"" the color is green (seen in Input 2 and Input 5)
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" the color is red (not directly shown, but can be inferred from Input 2 and Input 5 where ""wif bluf"" is followed by ""red red"")
- When ""bluf"" is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" the color is yellow (seen in Input 4)
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" or is between ""lug,"" the color is blue (seen in Input 3)

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" adopts the color of the next word unless it is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" in which case it is yellow.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that follows it, except if it is between ""wif"" and ""zup,"" where it is yellow.",-5.9007071583920006,115,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" in relation to the outputs (colors) given. To do so, let's examine each pair of input and corresponding output and look for a pattern.

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

From these examples, we observe the following:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
5. ""walm"" is consistently followed by the color ""green.""

Now, focusing on ""bluf,"" let's look at where it appears and what follows:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""red.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and is followed by ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and is followed by ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""red.""

Considering these patterns, it consistently appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

Thus,

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.",-6.063794271306,115,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns in the given examples. In each example, the word ""bluf"" is followed by a specific color in the output. We can analyze the color after each ""bluf"" to determine a rule or meaning.

Here are the examples with ""bluf"" and the corresponding color output:

1. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
2. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
3. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: wif zup bluf -> Output: red yellow yellow
5. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green

The color after ""bluf"" is consistently ""red"" in examples 2, 4, and 5. However, in example 1, it is ""green,"" and in example 3, it is the second ""blue."" This indicates that ""bluf"" doesn't always lead to the same color.

Upon further investigation, we can see that ""bluf"" is always followed by a color that has already appeared earlier in the same sequence:

1. ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" so the first occurrence of a color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and that's the output color following ""bluf.""
2. ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" so the ""bluf"" is followed by the color ""red,"" which has already appeared before it (from ""wif"").
3. ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue"" again.
4. ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" is followed by another ""yellow.""
5. ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is again followed by ""red.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" is followed by a color output that matches the last color mentioned before ""bluf."" If this rule holds true, ""bluf"" repeats the last color output mentioned before it appears.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the last color output mentioned before its appearance.",-7.521359048632999,115,bluf
"To discern the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine how its output changes depending on its position and surrounding words.

1. In the sequences ""zup dax bluf"" and ""wif zup bluf"", ""bluf"" follows different words but produces the same output color ""green.""
2. In the sequence ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" This differs from when it follows ""dax,"" where it produces ""green.""
3. In the sequence ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""dax."" The output for ""bluf"" here is ""blue,"" differing from the previous instances.
4. The word that follows ""bluf"" (i.e., ""dax"") consistently gets the output color ""green,"" regardless of what precedes ""dax.""
5. ""wif"" consistently produces ""red"" whether it precedes ""bluf"" or not.
6. ""lug"" and ""zup"" consistently produce ""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively, regardless of their position.

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that follows it unless it is the last word, in which case, it outputs the color ""yellow."" This is consistent with the data provided:

- In ""zup dax bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow because nothing follows it.
- In ""dax wif bluf"", ""bluf"" is red because it is followed by the end of the input (similarly to the first example).
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""bluf"" is green because it is followed by ""dax,"" which has the output color green.
- In ""wif zup bluf"", ""bluf"" is yellow because nothing follows it.

Thus, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the output color of the word that immediately follows it, or it outputs ""yellow"" if it is the last word in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the output color of the following word, or outputs ""yellow"" if it is the last word.",-10.92037824368,115,bluf
"Based on the examples provided where ""walm"" appears and the corresponding output, it can be deduced that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the following color three times. When ""walm"" follows a color-denoting word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times.

Here is the breakdown by example:
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" so ""walm"" following ""dax"" (which stands for ""green"") results in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" leads to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" so after the initial ""green"" for ""dax,"" ""wif walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated three times and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup walm lug wif"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" indicating that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red,"" meaning that after a yellow and blue for ""zup"" and ""lug"", respectively, ""zup walm"" once again results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" again showing that ""walm"" following ""lug"" (which stands for ""blue"") results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word that corresponds to a color, the output is that color repeated three times.

walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word to be repeated three times.",-1.066390220478,115,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word walm appears to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it two additional times. For instance, after ""dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" makes it repeat twice more.

Following this pattern:

- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in two additional repetitions of ""red.""
- In the third example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again suggesting that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" creates two more ""yellow"" instances.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the same rule applies with ""lug walm"" leading to ""blue blue blue,"" and the sequence ""zup lug zup walm"" leading to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule for walm is as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",-5.32727132314,115,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" signifies a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it exactly three times. Below are the interpretations according to the rule observed:

- In the first example, 'dax' is associated with the color green, followed by 'walm,' and the output is ""green green green.""
- In the second example, 'walm' appears twice and follows 'dax' (green) and 'lug' (blue) respectively, resulting in ""green green green"" for the first 'walm' and ""yellow yellow yellow"" for the second 'walm' following 'zup.'
- The third example has 'walm' following 'zup' (yellow), yielding ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the fourth example, 'walm' follows 'zup' (yellow) again, hence ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- Finally, in the fifth example, 'walm' comes after 'lug' (blue), leading to ""blue blue blue.""

From this, we can induce the following rule:

Here are the observed correlations for each word:

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" (seen in input 1 and 2).
- ""walm"" correlates with ""green"" (seen in input 2 and 4).
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" (seen in input 2 and 3).

Let's look at the commonalities and differences in the examples provided:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif zup"" => Output: ""green green green red yellow""
   - ""dax"" and ""walm"" both correlate with ""green.""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup wif lug wif"" => Output: ""yellow red blue red""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

3. Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" => Output: ""red red red green yellow""
   - ""walm"" and ""dax"" again correlate with ""red"" and ""green"" respectively, which is different from the first example.

4. Input: ""wif lug wif"" => Output: ""red blue red""
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

5. Input: ""zup wif dax"" => Output: ""yellow red green""
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""dax"" with ""green.""

From these observations, we can notice that every time the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It doesn't seem to matter what position ""wif"" is in the input; it consistently results in ""red"" in the output.

We can then conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input or the context of other words. Thus:

wif -> red",-0.42811994998999997,117,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif"", we must look for patterns in how the colors correspond to the provided input sequences. Let's compare the input sequences and their outputs:

1. dax walm wif zup        -> green green green red yellow
2. zup wif lug wif          -> yellow red blue red
3. wif walm dax zup         -> red red red green yellow
4. wif lug wif              -> red blue red
5. zup wif dax              -> yellow red green

We are looking for consistency in the colors produced by the word ""wif"" in each sequence:

- In sequence 1, the color following ""wif"" is red.
- In sequence 2, the colors following ""wif"" are red and red again.
- In sequence 3, the color preceding ""wif"" is red.
- In sequence 4, ""wif"" precedes and follows a color of blue, with both instances being red.
- In sequence 5, the color following ""wif"" is red.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" is always associated with the color red, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.210888565194,117,wif
"Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color associations for each word:

- ""dax"" consistently associates with the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently associates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" consistently associates with the color ""blue.""
- ""walm"" consistently associates with the color ""red.""

Now looking at the appearances of ""wif"":

- In the first example, it appears between ""walm"" and ""zup,"" the output colors being ""green red yellow,"" with ""wif"" correlating to the color ""green.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" appears twice and correlates with the color ""red,"" though it is amongst other ""wif"" and ""lug"" which correlates to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears at the start and correlates to the color ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears twice at the start and end and correlates to the color ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" appears between ""zup"" and ""dax,"" the output colors being ""yellow red green.""

With the information gathered from these examples, we can notice the following pattern:

""Wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" when it is not adjacent to the word ""dax."" When ""wif"" is directly before ""dax,"" it correlates to the color ""green."" There is insufficient data to determine its meaning when appearing directly after ""dax"" because this scenario does not occur in the provided examples. Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be related to its position relative to ""dax,"" with ""wif"" generally representing ""red"" except when it precedes ""dax,"" where it represents ""green.""

Rule: wif -> ""red"" when not adjacent to ""dax""; ""green"" when directly before ""dax"".",-5.238521301214,117,wif
"Observing the input and output sequences, we look for a pattern that can link the nonce word ""wif"" to the corresponding colors in the output. Let's break down the patterns from the examples given:

1. The word ""dax"" consistently leads to the output ""green.""

3. The word ""lug"" consistently leads to the output ""blue.""
4. The word ""wif"" leads to different colors (red, red, red, red, red) in the output.

Noticing that ""wif"" appears in various positions in the input sequence but always results in ""red"" in the output, we can conclude that ""wif"" is independent of its position within the sequence.

Based on the examples, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: Regardless of its position or the context within the sequence, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""",-5.417526431578,117,wif

3. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
4. Input: wif lug wif | Output: red blue red
5. Input: zup wif dax | Output: yellow red green

We can deduce the following:
- Every time ""wif"" appears, the output color is red.
- ""Dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""Walm"" corresponds to green.
- ""Lug"" corresponds to blue.

With this consistent relationship, it appears that ""wif"" results in the output of the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-6.841197113974998,117,wif
"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meanings of the words based on their consistent associations with certain outputs.

- ""bluf"" seems to translate to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to ""red"" when not, based on the second example, although this isn't consistent with the fourth and fifth examples. 
- ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue.""

Now, focusing on ""zup,"" we can see that regardless of its position, whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, the corresponding output always contains ""yellow.""

"Let's analyze the instances where ""bluf"" is used:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- ""zup"" yields ""yellow""
- ""wif"" yields ""red""

2. wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

- The pattern ""zup lug zup lug zup"" is consistent with ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow.""

5. wif dax bluf -> red green green
- We can see that ""wif"" yields ""red"" and ""dax"" yields ""green.""

Looking at the sequences, ""bluf"" seems to take the color of the previously mentioned color in the sequence except in the second example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which yields green but ""bluf"" yields yellow. Given the examples we have, the behavior of ""bluf"" does not seem consistent.

However, in examples 1, 3, and 4 where ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which yields ""yellow"") or ""wif"" (which yields ""red""), ""bluf"" yields a similar color to its preceding word (""yellow"" following ""zup"" and ""red"" following ""wif""). This may suggest that when following ""zup"" or ""wif"" ""bluf"" repeats the color.

Based on the evidence at hand, a potential rule could be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word if the preceding word is ""zup"" (yellow) or ""wif"" (red). However, this rule does not explain the second example where ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) but produces ""yellow"" instead of ""green."" In this case, more examples or additional context would be necessary to determine the rule governing the output of ""bluf."" 

Given the inconsistency observed, we might be missing a crucial piece of context that impacts how ""bluf"" behaves, or there may be additional conditions affecting its output that are not evident from the examples provided.",-0.9739766497100002,117,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns and positions of ""bluf"" relative to the other words and their corresponding color outputs.

1. When the input contains ""bluf"" as:
    - The last word following ""zup wif,"" the color sequence is red and yellow for ""wif"" and ""zup"" respectively, followed by two reds for ""bluf.""
    - The third word after ""wif zup"" and before ""lug,"" the sequence is red, yellow, two yellows for ""bluf,"" and then a pattern of blue and green corresponding to ""lug"" and ""walm dax.""
    - Following two instances of ""wif"" and before ""zup,"" we see a pattern of red for ""wif,"" green for ""dax,"" and yellow for ""zup,"" with ""bluf"" being two reds.
    - Alternating between ""zup"" and ""lug"" with ""bluf"" at the end, the sequence is yellow and blue for ""zup"" and ""lug"" respectively, and yellow for ""bluf.""
    - Between ""wif"" and ""dax,"" corresponding to red and green, ""bluf"" gives us a green.

Observing the patterns, ""bluf"" corresponds to a different output based on its position and the context provided by surrounding words. The most consistent element is that ""bluf"" generally results in a repeated color when preceded by different words (""wif dax bluf"" leads to red green green, and ""zup wif bluf"" gives us yellow red red).

However, this pattern does not hold when ""bluf"" is included in a sequence of repeating words (as in ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" where ""bluf"" corresponds to two reds, even though it's preceded by two instances of ""wif"").

With the given examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent and is best described by the sequence of colors it produces rather than by associating it with one consistent output. Based on the available data, we can hypothesize that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the preceding word, except when following a sequence or located at the end of a word sequence where the context changes its output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning is context-dependent and often repeats the color of the word immediately before it unless it is at the end of a word sequence or follows a sequence where it takes the color of the second-to-last word.",-7.377873430446,117,bluf
"To determine the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the given examples, focusing on the output each time ""bluf"" appears.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red. Right after ""bluf,"" the output is also red.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow. Right after ""bluf,"" the output is blue. This tells us that ""bluf"" might not simply be a repetition of the previous color because ""zup"" was yellow, not blue.

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output for ""wif"" is red. Right after ""bluf,"" the output is yellow, which is the output for ""zup"" that comes after ""bluf.""

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output for ""zup"" is yellow. The output right after ""bluf"" is yellow as well, which could mean that ""bluf"" may cause the following word to take on the color of the word before ""bluf.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

In this instance, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" and the output for ""dax"" is green. Right after ""bluf,"" the output is also green.

Now, pulling together these observations:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), the next color is either red or yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) or ""dax"" (green), the next color is typically the same as the previous one.
- ""Bluf"" does not simply repeat the color of the previous word. Rather, it might impact the next word's output based on some rule.

The key pattern appears to revolve around ""bluf"" impacting the color of the word that comes immediately after it. Upon reviewing the data, it seems that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the output color immediately following it is the same as the color of the word that came immediately before ""bluf,"" except when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" where it turns ""zup"" into yellow instead.

Thus the rule seems to be:

Rule: If the word following ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" the output is yellow; otherwise, the output color is the same as the word that precedes ""bluf.""

Hence, bluf -> The word immediately following ""bluf"" is colored as the preceding word, but if ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" it is colored yellow.",-8.446693141825,117,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the given inputs and outputs:

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

Based on the given data, we can see that:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to red.
- ""zup"" consistently translates to yellow.
- “lug” typically translates to blue.
- ""dax"" typically translates to green.

The word ""bluf"" appears to change its output in different contexts. To determine the rule, let's examine the position of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output:

1. When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""wif"" (as in ""wif bluf""), the output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (as in ""zup bluf""), the output is yellow.
3. In a sequence with ""dax,"" ""bluf"" appears to result in an output of green.

It seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it. In the fifth example, ""wif dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is green, suggesting that it mirrors the color of ""dax.""

Here is the derived rule:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" represents a color, and the specific color it represents depends on the preceding word in the sequence. It takes on the color output associated with the word immediately before it.

"Based on the examples provided, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" as follows:

When we observe the output of examples 1 and 4, the pattern for ""wif walm"" is consistently ""red red red"". This suggests that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it.

In example 2, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" again seems to cause the repetition of the color associated with ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

In example 3, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue,"" and here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" once more resulting in repeating the color ""blue.""

Finally, in example 5, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue,"" reinforcing the rule deduced from the prior examples.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" results in the output color being repeated for however many nonce words precede it. 

Let's break down each example:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red: ""bluf"" follows two nonce words (""zup"" and ""wif""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated twice.
2. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""wif""), resulting in ""red"" being repeated once.
3. dax bluf -> green green: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""dax""), resulting in ""green"" being repeated once.
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue: ""bluf"" follows one nonce word (""lug""), resulting in ""blue"" being repeated once.
5. wif lug zup bluf -> red blue yellow yellow: ""bluf"" follows three nonce words (""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup""), resulting in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> The color corresponding to the nonce word immediately before ""bluf"" is repeated for as many times as there are nonce words before ""bluf"" in the sequence.

(Note: It is assumed that each word corresponds to a specific color, for example, ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" based on the provided examples.)",-1.0747707399139999,118,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can induce that the rule relating to the nonce word ""bluf"" is that it translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it. Let's examine the patterns:

1. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red"" suggests that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color associated with the word before it"", which is 'red' from ""wif"".

2. ""wif bluf zup"" -> ""red red yellow"" reinforces the rule, with ""bluf"" repeating the color from ""wif"" again, which is 'red'.

3. ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" implies that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"", which is 'green'.

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" provides additional evidence, as ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the color 'blue' is repeated.

5. ""wif lug zup bluf"" -> ""red blue yellow yellow"" shows that ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the color 'yellow' is duplicated.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.",-1.1967124594360001,118,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns between the inputs containing ""bluf"" and their corresponding outputs. We will look at each example and analyze the position of ""bluf"" and the colors that appear in the output.

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - ""bluf"" results in ""red""

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   - ""bluf"" results in ""red""

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""bluf"" results in ""green""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""bluf"" results in ""green""

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" results in ""yellow""

Observing the outputs, it's evident that ""bluf"" does not have a fixed color association. Instead, its meaning seems to depend on its position or context within the input string. Let us now establish a pattern based on the positions.

1. ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" -> Output color is ""red""
2. ""bluf"" precedes ""zup"" -> Output color is ""red""
3. ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" -> Output color is ""green""
4. ""bluf"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax"" -> Output color is ""green""
5. ""bluf"" comes after ""zup"" -> Output color is ""yellow""

There doesn't seem to be a straightforward rule such as ""bluf"" always translating to a specific color. Instead, ""bluf"" might represent a duplicative or reflective property since it's repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the output pattern, except in the case where it follows ""lug"" then it defaults to ""green"".

Let's apply this potential rule to the examples:

1. ""bluf"" replicates the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" -> ""red""
2. Again, ""bluf"" replicates the color of ""wif"" -> ""red""
3. ""bluf"" replicates the color of ""dax"" -> ""green""
4. ""bluf"" comes after ""lug""; since there is no prior instance of ""lug"" which would provide a color, it defaults to ""green""
5. ""bluf"" replicates the color of ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

According to this analysis, the rule for ""bluf"" could be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" results in the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input. If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" it defaults to ""green"".",-6.064697508437999,118,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" represents the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""bluf"" causes it to repeat. Similarly, ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" is associated with the color green and ""bluf"" repeats it.",-7.00935129248,118,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the position of the word and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow

When looking at the output colors, ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond directly to a single color, but rather it seems to repeat the color of the previous word:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, then ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" corresponds to another red, repeating the color for ""wif"".

2. ""wif"" corresponds to red, then ""bluf"" repeats red, and ""zup"" brings back yellow.

3. ""dax"" correspond to green, and ""bluf"" repeats green.

4. ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue, ""bluf"" repeats blue, then ""dax"" again corresponds to green, and when ""lug"" appears again, it still corresponds to blue.

5. ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" finally repeats the color of ""zup"": yellow.

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that directly precedes it.",-8.198939030786999,118,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we'll examine its position relative to the other words and the corresponding outputs.

In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, the word ""lug"" results in ""blue."" ""zup"" results in a single ""yellow."" Notice that ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by ""blue"" thrice both times, just like the output for ""lug.""

In the second example, ""dax walm wif zup,"" we have ""green green green red yellow."" ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow."" After ""walm"" the output sequence of colors is ""green red yellow,"" which corresponds with the sequence that ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" should produce based on individual color assignments.

In the third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" we have ""red red red green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" precedes a sequence ""red green yellow,"" which would match the outputs of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup,"" respectively.

In the fourth example, ""dax wif walm,"" the result is ""green red red red,"" which indicates that ""walm"" results in multiple ""red"" outputs, the same as ""wif.""

In the last example, ""lug walm,"" we have ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" results in multiple ""blue"" outputs, indicating that it duplicates the output of the preceding word.

Rule: ""walm"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it three times.

Walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the next three colors in the output to be the same as the color designated to the word that appears immediately before ""walm.""

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue"" thrice. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" thrice. When ""walm"" is after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" thrice.",-0.9414880912480001,118,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the outputs relative to the inputs where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. dax walm wif zup -> green green green red yellow
3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. lug walm -> blue blue blue

From the above examples, we can see that the appearance of ""walm"" after a word correlates with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" For example, looking at the first input, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times. Similarly, for the fourth input, ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" ""red"" appears three times.

Every time ""walm"" is used, it seems to instruct the output to repeat the color of the preceding specific word thrice. It's consistent in every case regardless of what follows ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.",-1.2341182178680001,118,walm
"Rule: The word ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the word before it three times. 

For example:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-6.082065780260001,118,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to focus on how the output changes with the presence of ""walm"" and the context of other words around it.

In the first example, the appearance of ""lug walm"" leads to three occurrences of ""blue"" in the output.
In the second example, ""walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" adding an extra ""green"" before ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red.""
In the third example, the sequence ""wif walm"" again seems to add an extra ""red"" before ""wif,"" which normally corresponds to one ""red.""
In the fourth example, ""wif walm"" once more results in ""red red red,"" indicating the addition of two ""red""s before ""wif.""
In the fifth example, ""lug walm"" leads to three ""blue""s, similar to the first example.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word immediately before it two more times. If no word comes before ""walm,"" as in the second and third examples, ""walm"" appears to create three instances of the color based on the word immediately following it.

Rule: walm -> ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it two more times; if no word comes before it, it repeats the color of the word after it three times.",-8.019413072032,118,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the correlation between the inputs and the outputs in each example:

- Input: lug walm zup lug walm | Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
  From this, we can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

- Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green green green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

- Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
  ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

- Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
  ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red red red"".

- Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"".

From the examples given, we can infer that inserting the word ""walm"" after another word adds an additional repetition of that word's corresponding color. It's interesting to note that the repetition count seems to be consistent for a given color: ""lug"" always leads to three blues, ""dax"" to three greens, and ""wif"" to three reds. ""walm"" following these words does not increase the repetition count. Based on the information available, the purpose of ""walm"" could be considered to repeat the existing pattern without changing it, but let's look at the specific cases:

- In the first and last examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug"", and the output is a repetition of three blues, but there is no change right after the word ""walm"".

- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif"", and each time it is followed by a new color word. It seems to maintain the three repetitions of the previous color.

So from these examples, ""walm"" in this context seems to *maintain the current color pattern without adding to it*. However, the rule is slightly ambiguous due to the lack of a clear change directly after ""walm"" in the examples provided.

"From the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of walm by looking at the patterns in the inputs and outputs. We'll look at both the position of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs.

1. Whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, the output consists of multiple instances of the same color, except for the presence of ""dax"" which precedes a different color. Let's look closer:
- ""dax wif walm"" -> green red red red
- ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue blue blue
- ""dax walm zup"" -> green green green yellow

2. The color that is repeated in the output seems to correspond to the word immediately before ""walm"" unless ""dax"" is present at the beginning, which seems to add a ""green"" at the start.
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""lug walm"" -> blue blue blue

3. When ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" it does not change the repeating pattern initiated by ""walm""; it just adds ""yellow"" at the end:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to look for patterns in the input and the corresponding output.

1. In the first example, ""dax walm zup walm"" is translated to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow"". The repetition of ""walm"" and ""yellow"" suggests that ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow."" Additionally, both ""dax"" and ""zup"" result in ""green,"" but ""zup"" also appears in other sequences with different colors in the output.

2. The second example, ""dax zup lug wif lug,"" yields ""green yellow blue red blue."" ""Dax"" results in ""green"" again, and the repetition of ""lug"" yielding ""blue"" both times suggests that ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" ""Wif"" results in ""red.""

3. In the third example, the word ""dax"" again correlates with ""green"" in the output, while the word ""lug"" consistently yields ""blue.""

4. The fourth example shows ""dax"" in between two ""bluf"" words and the output is ""red red green green."" It seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

5. The fifth example again has ""dax"" at the beginning, and it translates to ""green.""

From these examples, we can notice that no matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence, the color ""green"" is always the output. Thus, we can deduce that ""dax"" always correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of context or position within the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green",-8.159197000406,120,dax

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" starts the output sequence or is inserted at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input.
2. The presence of ""dax"" doesn't seem to affect the color associated with the other words, meaning it doesn't change the ""color"" that follows other words (""walm"" still leads to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, and ""zup"" to yellow).

Given these observations, ""dax"" specifically corresponds to the color ""green,"" and its occurrence in the input directly translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

3. No matter where ""dax"" appears in the input sequence, it does not seem to impact the colors assigned to other words (e.g., ""walm"" always corresponds to ""yellow"").

Rule: dax -> green.",-12.706266968699998,120,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule for ""dax"" by looking at the patterns of input and corresponding output colors. Let's analyze:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is included in the output sequence.
- The position where ""green"" appears in the output seems to correlate with the position of ""dax"" in the input.
- In examples where ""dax"" is the first word, ""green"" is the first color in the output; when ""dax"" is in the third position, ""green"" is the third color in the output, and so forth.

Given the above observations, we can induce that ""dax"" equates to the color ""green,"" and the position of ""dax"" in the input corresponds directly to the position of ""green"" in the output. So, we can establish the following rule:

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning, it results in ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is in the middle, it yields ""green.""

Rule: wif -> red",-8.74505142786,120,wif
"Based on the given examples, 'wif' translates to a color each time it appears; however, the specific color it represents is not consistent across the examples. Instead, the color that 'wif' represents seems dependent on the context, particularly its position relative to other words. By analyzing the examples, we can deduce the following:

- When 'wif' follows 'lug', the output color is 'red'.
- When 'wif' follows 'dax', the output color is 'green'.
- When 'wif' is followed by 'dax', the output color is 'red'.
- When 'wif' stands alone (i.e., without a word before) as in ""wif dax"", the output color is 'red'.

Although the above rules deduced from the examples help with the color determination for 'wif', there is insufficient data to define a comprehensive rule that applies to all possible contexts. For example: 
- In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", 'wif' translates to 'blue', which doesn't fit the previously observed patterns.

Therefore, the rule for 'wif' may be as follows:

3. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
4. zup dax lug walm zup -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow
5. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output repeats the color corresponding to ""dax"" before it, which is ""green,"" three times before continuing with the pattern.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output repeats the color corresponding to ""wif"" before it, which is ""red,"" three times before continuing with the pattern.
- ""zup"" seems to be unrelated to ""walm"" as ""zup"" has its own consistent output of ""yellow.""

From this analysis, it appears that ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. However, since ""lug"" only appears before ""walm"" and always produces ""blue,"" and the only exception in color repetition is when ""dax"" or ""wif"" is followed by another word (and not ""walm""), it seems that ""walm"" itself represents ""blue blue blue"" when following ""lug"" and causes the color associated with the word immediately prior to ""walm"" to be repeated three times for other cases.

The rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" following a color word causes that color to be repeated three times. When following ""lug,"" ""walm"" specifically translates to ""blue blue blue.""

- Example 3: 'zup bluf' results in 'yellow yellow,' indicating that when 'bluf' follows 'zup,' it means 'yellow.'
- Example 4: 'lug dax bluf' results in 'blue green green.' The only change to the color sequence occurs after 'dax,' where 'bluf' results in 'green.'
- Example 5: 'wif bluf' results yet again in 'red red,' supporting the initial conclusion when 'bluf' follows 'wif.'

Rule: The meaning of 'bluf' changes based on the word that comes immediately before it. When 'bluf' follows 'wif' or stands alone, it means 'red.' When 'bluf' follows 'dax,' it means 'green.' When 'bluf' follows 'zup,' it means 'yellow.' There is no information on what 'bluf' means when it follows 'lug,' as it is always paired with 'dax' in that context, so we assume the 'dax' rule takes precedence.

bluf -> meaning:
- After 'wif' or standalone: 'red'
- After 'dax': 'green'
- After 'zup': 'yellow'",-4.23588479254,121,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it seems that bluf corresponds to the color that is specified by the word immediately preceding it. 

For instance: 
- When 'wif' precedes 'bluf', the output is red.
- When 'zup' precedes 'bluf', the output is yellow.
- There is no instance of 'dax' preceding 'bluf', but 'dax' corresponds with green and 'lug' with blue otherwise; however, we do not have direct examples of these preceding 'bluf'.

Therefore, the closest rule we can induce with the given examples is:

Rule: bluf -> the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it.

In other words, if 'bluf' follows a word, it takes on the color that is the output of that word. Thus:

wif bluf -> red red
zup bluf -> yellow yellow
lug dax bluf -> not explicitly shown but we can assume if lug was directly before bluf it would be blue blue given other data points. 

This rule induction hinges on the assumption that there is a direct relationship between 'bluf' and the word that comes before it, as supported by the consistency in the examples provided. Note that without additional examples, we can't fully verify the rule for all cases, but it holds true for the ones given.",-5.054877512660001,121,bluf

- When ""bluf"" is proceeded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""bluf"" is placed between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""

It appears that ""bluf"" results in the output repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> red",-8.547901853128,121,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the patterns before and after the word appears in each input and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax wif walm"" turns into ""green red red red,"" where ""red"" is the only color that repeats, and ""walm"" is the only word in the input that does not correspond to a single color in the output.

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif lug"" maps to ""blue blue blue red blue."" We can see that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" likely corresponds to ""red,"" as seen in the first and last examples. ""Walm"" occurs once and correlates with three instances of ""blue.""

- The third example, ""lug dax walm,"" outputs ""blue green green green."" Again, ""lug"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. Since ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" it seems to repeat the color prior to its position.

- In the fourth example, ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" The word ""walm"" again correlates with a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

- The fifth example, ""dax walm wif,"" turns into ""green green green red."" Here ""walm"" repeats the color related to ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it thrice. For instance, if the word before ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" then ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word three times.",-0.890352167388,121,walm
"Walm -> meaning: The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times, followed by the color associated with ""wif.""

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (e.g., dax -> green, lug -> blue, zup -> yellow), it translates to the color of that word repeated three times. After the ""walm"" repetition, the succeeding ""wif"" results in the color red. 

Examples: 
- ""dax wif walm"" results in green red red red (green for dax, then red for wif, followed by walm which repeats the red three times).
- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in blue blue blue red blue (blue for the first lug, walm repeats this blue three times, red for wif, then blue for the second lug).
- ""lug dax walm"" results in blue green green green (blue for lug, green for dax, then walm repeats the green three times).
- ""zup wif walm"" results in yellow red red red (yellow for zup, then red for wif, followed by walm repeating the red three times).
- ""dax walm wif"" results in green green green red (green for dax, walm repeats this green three times, then red for wif).",-0.9014202601699999,121,walm
"To induce the rule for what ""walm"" means, we need to analyze the patterns and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the examples:

1. dax wif walm -> green red red red (We notice that dax gives green and wif gives red, ""walm"" results in a sequence of red.)
2. lug walm wif lug -> blue blue blue red blue (Here, lug gives blue, wif gives red and again ""walm"" seems to yield a series of the color associated with the preceding word.)
3. lug dax walm -> blue green green green (Once again, the sequence after ""walm"" continues the color preceding it.)
4. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (zup gives yellow, wif gives red, and ""walm"" results in the preceding color repeated.)
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red (Here dax gives green, and after ""walm"" we see repeated green until wif which results in red.)

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. It seems to have no effect on the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before ""walm"" in the sequence.",-1.140088973568,121,walm
"Given the examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a modifier that repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. We can see that after the word ""walm,"" the color that was mentioned right before it is reiterated multiple times. The count of repetition matches the number of times ""walm"" appears in sequence after the color word.

For example, in ""dax wif walm"":

- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it takes the color ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeats it once since ""walm"" appears only one time after ""wif"".

Now let's check this rule with all the inputs:

1. ""lug walm wif lug"":
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it should take the color ""blue"" from ""lug"" and repeat it, which it does twice, matching the two ""blue"" outputs.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- The last ""lug,"" being separate from ""walm"", translates to ""blue"" again.

2. ""lug dax walm"":
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it should take the color ""green"" from ""dax"" and repeat it, which it does three times in a row, matching the three instances of ""green"" following the first instance of ""green"" in the output.

3. ""zup wif walm"":
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"".
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it should take the color ""red"" from ""wif"" and repeat it, which it does three times in a row, matching the three ""red"" in the output.

4. ""dax walm wif"":
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it should take the color ""green"" and repeat it, which it does twice in the output.
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"", which is the lone ""red"" in the output.

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the word before it and repeats it for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively after that word.",-5.26670524136,121,walm
"Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""walm."" Here's what we observe from each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red.""

2. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and results in ""blue blue.""

3. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""green green.""

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red red.""

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Analysis: The word ""walm"" precedes ""wif"" and results in ""green green.""

From these observations, we can formulate the following rule:

- When ""walm"" follows another word (e.g., ""wif,"" ""dax""), it results in that word's corresponding color being repeated twice.
- When ""walm"" precedes another word (e.g., ""wif""), it results in its own previous color being repeated twice.

Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to represent a doubling of the color associated with the preceding word or its own color if it is followed by ""wif."" For example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green."" When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" we see ""green green"" before we see the ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Based on this, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it duplicates the color associated with that word. When ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" it duplicates its own previous color.",-6.440771561467999,121,walm
"lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the output always includes the color ""blue"".

"Based on the inputs and outputs provided, it is possible to induce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""dax."" By checking where ""dax"" is in the input and what word is it translated to in the output, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
- It seems that ""dax"" is independent of its position in the input sequence since it always results in ""green,"" whether it is at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the input string.
- Other words in the examples—such as ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif""—are consistently translated to ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively.

"To deduce the meaning or the rule that the word ""wif"" follows, we can look for a consistent pattern between the input and the output in the examples given:

- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
- Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
- Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- Input: wif -> Output: red

In each of these examples, whenever the word 'wif' appears in the input, a 'red' appears in the output. No other word in the input is consistently translated to 'red' in the output.

Also, notice that 'walm' always results in repeated output colors ('red' or 'yellow') corresponding to the number of letters in the preceding word. For instance, 'lug walm' results in 'blue red red red', indicating the color 'red' repeats three times just as 'lug' has three letters.

Now we know that 'walm' also has a meaning; it means to repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

Let's deduce the rules with this information:

- The word 'wif' is directly translated to the color 'red' in every instance.
- Other words seem to be translated into distinct colors ('lug' into 'blue', 'dax' into 'green', 'zup' into 'yellow').

3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
5. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green

From the examples, we can observe that ""bluf"" always corresponds to the same color that directly precedes it:

1. ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" after it is also red.
2. The sequence ""zup wif lug dax"" repeats as ""yellow red blue green,"" and ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" becomes yellow as well.
3. ""zup"" is yellow and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which is also yellow.
4. In this case, ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" after it is also green.
5. Again, ""dax"" is green and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" which is also green.

Let's take a look at the instances where ""bluf"" appears:

1. ""wif bluf dax"" -> ""red red green""
2. ""wif bluf zup wif lug dax"" -> ""red red yellow red blue green""
3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
5. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""

From the examples given, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""bluf"" leads to the immediate repetition of the color that is associated with the word before it. In examples 1, 3, and 5, the color that is output right before the color associated with ""bluf"" is exactly the same. In example 4, it is a bit more complicated because of the repetition pattern, but the color before ""bluf"" repeats once again immediately after.

Extracting the rule based on these examples:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf.""

So, if we summarize:

3. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow""
4. ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" -> ""blue red green green red blue""
5. ""zup dax bluf"" -> ""yellow green green""

In each case, the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" is translated into a color, and the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the output for the preceding word:

- In examples 1, 2, 3, and 5, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" which output ""red"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. The output for ""bluf"" is the same as the word before it: ""red"" in examples 1 and 2, ""yellow"" in example 3, and ""yellow"" in example 5.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" whose output is ""green."" The output for ""bluf"" is again ""green.""

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color output of the word immediately before it. 

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning is a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-1.1955520783199998,122,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine its usage across the provided examples and the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

By analyzing the inputs and their outputs, we see that ""bluf"" always corresponds to whatever color the word right before it outputs. For instance:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which outputs ""red"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" again, which outputs ""red"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""red"".
- In the third and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which outputs ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which outputs ""green"", so ""bluf"" outputs the same color ""green"".

Therefore, the general rule is that ""bluf"" takes on the color output of the word that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule: bluf -> the same output color as the word immediately before it.",-5.405631317408,122,bluf
"Using the provided examples, we can observe the outputs that correspond to each input that includes the nonce word ""bluf."" By comparing the inputs and their respective outputs, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with ""bluf.""

From the outputs, we notice that every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output. To verify this, let's check the occurrence of ""bluf"" against the output color ""green"":

1. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" which then turns into ""green"".

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"" which then turns into ""green"".

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" which then turns into ""green"", but since there's no ""green"" in the output, the rule might not be as simple as ""bluf"" directly translating to ""green"".

4. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""green"".

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green"".

Given the inconsistencies in the third example where ""bluf"" did not translate directly into ""green"", the sequence, placement, and effect of ""bluf"" in the output might be influenced additionally by its position or by the nonces appearing before it. However, in every other instance, ""bluf"" either follows or turns into ""green"" in the output. 

Considering these observations, it's challenging to provide an absolute rule since the third example conflicts with the direct translation of ""bluf"" to ""green."" Despite this, based on the other examples, the most consistent observation is that ""bluf"" is often associated with the color ""green"" in the output, while noting that its exact meaning may be conditional and complex.

Rule: ""bluf"" may correspond to the color ""green"" in the output, but the rule's application seems to be dependent on context or other conditions yet to be determined.",-5.547302478008,122,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine its occurrences in the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm zup lug walm -> blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
3. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green

If we try to identify a pattern correlating to ""walm,"" we need to observe what each item translates to and how ""walm"" affects the sequence.

- Each word in the input (non-""walm"") results in a color in the output: ""lug"" is blue, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green.

- When ""walm"" appears after a single word, the output is three instances of the color associated with that word. For example:
  - dax walm -> green green green
  - zup wif walm -> yellow red red red (note that ""wif"" is red, followed by three reds)
  
- When ""walm"" appears after two words, as in the first example, it seems that the first word's color is repeated twice (blue blue for ""lug""), followed by the second word's color once (yellow for ""zup""), and then ""walm"" introduces two more of the first word's color (more ""blue"").

Based on these observations, a rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it triggers repetition of the colors preceding it, with a specific pattern of the number of times:

First case: When ""walm"" is preceded by one word, it produces three instances of the color.
Second case: When ""walm"" follows a two-word sequence where ""lug"" precedes it, it repeats the first color twice, allows the second color once, and then repeats the first color twice more.

However, we have insufficient data to fully determine what would happen if ""walm"" follows a two-word sequence where ""dax"" or ""zup"" precedes it, or if ""walm"" follows more than two words.

Based on the limited examples we have:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats the corresponding color three times. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and then another color word, it repeats the ""lug"" color twice, places the second color once, and repeats the ""lug"" color twice more. The rule for sequences of two words other than ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" or if there are more than two words before ""walm"" is indeterminate with the provided data.",-1.2458634702200002,122,walm

   Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Green"" is repeated three times because ""dax"" has three letters.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Green"" is repeated three times due to the three letters in ""dax.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Explanation: The word ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Green"" is repeated three times because ""dax"" has three letters.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" represents a rule where it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it a number of times equal to the number of letters in that word.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word, as many times as there are letters in that word.",-4.596415997169001,122,walm
"walm -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the previous word two additional times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (lug->blue, zup->yellow, wif->red, dax->green), it repeats the color of the preceding word two more times. For instance, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", and ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".",-5.55822591224,122,walm
"Observing the inputs and outputs, we can induce a rule for the nonce word ""walm."" It appears that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color that corresponds with the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions of the color also seems to be equal to the number of letters in the word ""walm"". Given that ""walm"" has four letters, the color that corresponds to the preceding word is repeated four times. 

Here's the breakdown based on the provided examples:

1. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue blue
2. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red red
3. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green green

In each case above, the word immediately before ""walm"" translates to a color that is repeated four times (since ""walm"" has four letters).

So, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word four times.",-7.124565135769999,122,walm

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Here is the breakdown of the rule induction:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green"" followed by ""blue,"" which seems to indicate that ""lug"" means ""blue."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" it is logical to assume that ""dax"" means ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by the output ""green."" ""Walm"" appears after ""dax"" and the output ""green,"" followed by ""red,"" followed by ""blue,"" followed by ""green,"" seems to indicate the color sequence and confirms that ""dax"" is indeed ""green.""
- The third example again includes ""dax"" before ""lug,"" which produces ""green"" before ""blue."" ""Zup"" appears before ""bluf"" and ""wif,"" leading to outputs ""yellow"" and ""red"" respectively, further confirming that ""dax"" is ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in ""green"" and then ""green"" again for ""zup,"" which seems to break the rule. However, since the sequence is ambiguous, let's assume ""dax"" stands for ""green,"" and look for explanations in the broader context.
- In the last example, ""zup"" and ""dax"" appear one after the other, resulting in ""yellow"" and ""green,"" which fits our running theory.

Considering the information from all the examples, the most consistent interpretation is that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green",-6.9784195787079994,123,dax
"Examining the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can deduce the following:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and correlates with ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax"" is repeated and each occurrence corresponds with ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" again follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""dax"" remains ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" and both correspond with ""green.""
- In the final example, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of the words that precede or follow it.

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green",-7.886094209752,123,dax
"dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" across all examples given.",-9.238986753068,123,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each input that contains the word ""dax"" results in the output including ""green."" Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green",-9.723622814479999,123,dax
"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples provided.

From the inputs and corresponding outputs, we notice:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the input to correspond to ""green"" in the output.
  
Taking these observations into account, we can infer that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the context it is used in.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green",-10.435882969352003,123,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we first need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's start by seeing where ""wif"" appears and what the corresponding output is:

- Example 1: dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) and then ""wif"" again (red).
  
- Example 2: wif zup -> red yellow
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

- Example 3: wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""walm"" (green green).
  
- Example 4: zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""dax"" (green).
  
- Example 5: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and appears after ""bluf"" (yellow) and ""dax"" (green), and is followed by ""zup"" (yellow) then ""bluf"" again (yellow) and ""lug"" (blue).

Now, let's try to deduce the rule:

- In all instances, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""

There are no obvious conditions or context-dependent rules that affect the output for ""wif"" based on the examples provided. It appears to have a one-to-one mapping with the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red",-1.020683671082,123,wif
"Examining the provided examples, we need to determine the meaning of the word ""wif"". We'll look at the position of ""wif"" in each input and the corresponding color in each output:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" both times it appears.

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   ""wif"" is at the beginning and outputs ""red"".

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   ""wif"" is at the beginning again and outputs ""red"".

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again.

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" once more.

From each of these examples, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the Output is ""red"". There is no instance where ""wif"" corresponds to any color other than ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, we can deduce the rule for ""wif"":

Rule: wif -> red",-5.60850523765,123,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to analyze the common patterns in the given examples and their corresponding output colors. Let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Analyzing the examples:

- In examples 1, 2, and 4, the word ""wif"" precedes unique words and is followed by a red color in the output each time.

- In example 3, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and ""dax"" which are associated with red and green when they appear after ""wif"".

- In example 5, ""wif"" is again followed by different words (""zup"", ""bluf"", ""lug"") and is associated with a red output every time.

Based on the pattern in the outputs, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the words that follow. Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. The surrounding words seem to influence the output color for other words, but ""wif"" remains constant with red.

Rule: wif -> red",-6.794271819305,123,wif

"bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. 

Rule: When bluf follows another word, the output color is the same as the color represented by the word before bluf. For example:
- ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"" because lug means blue.
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because wif means red.
- ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because dax means green.",-2.54837899426,123,bluf
"From the given examples, we can infer the following patterns:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"", the output includes ""green"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output includes ""red"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", the output includes ""yellow"".

The pattern suggests that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the word that precedes it. Here is the deduced rule:

- After ""lug"", ""bluf"" means ""blue"".
- After ""dax"", ""bluf"" means ""green"".
- After ""wif"", ""bluf"" means ""red"".
- After ""zup"", ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".

However, it always seems to output the color twice, except for the case with ""dax"" where it outputs both ""green"" and ""bluf"" equates to ""green"".

Rule: ""bluf"" means the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated once. In the case of ""dax"", ""bluf"" translates to just ""green"" without repetition.",-3.3282141339999995,123,bluf
"Based on the examples given, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its meaning according to the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red blue.""
2. ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""blue blue.""
3. ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""green green.""
4. ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow red.""

From these examples, we can infer the following rule:

- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with ""dax"" (green).
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).
- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it appears that ""bluf"" might reverse the order of the colors, but since there's only one example, this is not certain.
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be the reverse order of ""zup's"" associated color (yellow becomes red).

However, there is not sufficient data to definitively conclude the rule for ""wif"" and ""zup"" because there's only one instance of each, so those interpretations are tentative.

The best supported rule from the examples is:
Rule: When preceded by certain words such as ""lug"" or ""dax,"" ""bluf"" takes on the color that the preceding word represents; with ""lug,"" bluf is blue, and with ""dax,"" bluf is green. Without more data, the effect of other words like ""wif"" and ""zup"" on ""bluf"" is less clear.",-4.0388482222,123,bluf
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.,-5.32320270722,123,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. Input: wif lug bluf -> Output: red blue blue
2. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue
3. Input: zup lug bluf -> Output: yellow blue blue

Here, ""lug"" always results in ""blue,"" and each instance of ""bluf"" follows the color that ""lug"" represents. ""bluf"" seems to be repeating the color that comes before it. Let's check further examples to confirm this.

4. Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
5. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

In both these cases, ""bluf"" repeats the color indicated by the word just before it. 

Given this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.",-5.333204788007,123,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the output is a sequence of colors, with each color corresponding to a specific input word. 

For ""zup,"" the consistent output is yellow. 
For ""lug,"" the consistent output is blue. 
For ""wif,"" the consistent output is red. 
For ""dax,"" the consistent output is green. 

Now examining the instances where ""walm"" is used, it consistently results in repeating the color associated with the preceding word three times. For instance:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug wif walm lug,"" we see that after ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, the output is ""red red red,"" and then it continues with ""blue"" for ""lug.""
- In ""dax wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and the output is ""green red red red"" (with ""dax"" corresponding to green before that).
- In ""lug walm zup lug zup wif,"" the sequence following ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue,"" which is the repetition of the color associated with ""lug.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the output colors corresponding to each appearance of ""dax"" and the other words in the inputs:

In the first example, ""wif walm dax"" gives the output of ""red red red green."" Since ""dax"" is different from ""wif"" and ""walm,"" and the colors associated with them (""red"") are also different, it's reasonable to assume that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

In the second example, ""dax wif dax"" gives the output ""green red green."" Both instances of ""dax"" correspond to ""green,"" supporting the initial assumption.

In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" which implies that ""dax"" is once more translating to ""green,"" but it also raises the possibility that ""walm"" might be related to ""green"" under certain conditions.

In the fourth example, ""zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow green red."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green"" again, which is consistent with our earlier observations.

In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" gives ""green blue red."" ""Dax"" is still associated with ""green,"" further reinforcing the idea that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Taking into account all the examples provided, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.",-0.869255522976,124,dax
"Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to colors in the Output, but its particular color changes depending on its position in the Input sentence or the context of the words around it. Let's look closely at each example:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
2. Input: dax wif dax
   Output: green red green
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
4. Input: zup dax wif
   Output: yellow green red
5. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

To determine the rule for ""dax,"" let's examine where it appears and the corresponding color in the Output:

- In examples 2 and 3, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""green.""
- In example 1, ""dax"" is at the end and also corresponds to ""green.""
- In example 4, ""dax"" is in the middle and corresponds to ""green,"" but ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" and this sequence leads to ""red"" afterward, which is consistent with the Output of example 1.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is at the beginning, followed by ""lug,"" leading to ""blue,"" indicating the word after ""dax"" might influence the color associated with ""lug.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position. However, the color associated with the words following ""dax"" can vary. There is not enough information about how the words following ""dax"" determine the color to set a clear rule for their correlation. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" alone appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green.",-6.199693835527271,124,dax
"Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax."" Let's examine the input and output patterns to infer the rules.

1. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
2. Input: dax wif dax -> Output: green red green
3. Input: dax walm -> Output: green green green
4. Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
5. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red

Analyzing the patterns, we can try to correlate the positions of ""dax"" and the corresponding colored output:

- In example 1, ""dax"" is at the end and correlates with green.
- In example 2, ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end, correlating with green at both places.
- In example 3, ""dax"" is at the beginning followed by ""walm,"" correlating with green green green.
- In example 4, ""dax"" is in the middle and correlates with green.
- In example 5, ""dax"" is at the beginning and correlates with green.

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-6.362430646338,124,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" translates to a specific color in the output sequence. To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns:

1. In the first example, the output corresponding to ""dax"" is green.
2. In the second example, ""dax"" appears twice and both times it corresponds to green.
3. In the third example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and both are associated with green.
4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" is between ""zup"" and ""wif,"" and for ""dax,"" the output is green.
5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

From all these examples, it is consistent that whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, it translates to the color green in the output. Therefore, the rule we can deduce for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

- When ""dax"" appears after ""zup"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" (see Example 4).

While the rule is consistent for ""dax"" being ""green"" when it appears either before or after the words provided in the examples, other seemingly unrelated words also precede a specific color (e.g., ""wif"" always precedes ""red"" and ""walm"" always precedes ""green"", except for the first example, which adds a bit of uncertainty regarding ""walm"").

4. Finally, ""lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue yellow,"" which further supports that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Given these observations, we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: In this context, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Hence:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the preceding word.",-2.58808480464,124,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be deduced by observing its position and the output colors associated with the other words:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
4. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

In each example where ""bluf"" is present, the output color that follows ""bluf"" is the same color as the word that precedes it:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow) and followed by ""wif"" (red), so the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is yellow.
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is only preceded by ""wif"" (red), and the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is also red.
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) and followed by ""zup"" (yellow), so the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" (blue) again and followed by ""wif"" (red), with the color corresponding to ""bluf"" remaining blue.
- In the fifth example, similar to the third, ""bluf"" is again preceded by ""lug"" (blue), and the corresponding color is blue.

Given these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that precedes it.",-4.125448397354001,124,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can come up with the following observations:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, its corresponding output color matches the color of the word directly preceded by ""bluf"".

     - In the first example, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"".
     - In the second example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"".
     - In the third example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue"".
     - Similarly, this pattern fits all the other examples.

2. ""bluf"" does not seem to have a static corresponding color, as its output color changes depending on the preceding word's output color.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for 'bluf':

Rule: 'bluf' corresponds to the same color as the word before it.

Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" in the context of these examples is:

bluf -> Takes the same color as the preceding word.",-5.939100052500001,124,bluf
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it. Here are the specific translations according to each example:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in this case.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""

To write the rule as requested:

"Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" results in the output being a repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it.

Example Breakdown:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", thus the output puts ""yellow"" again after ""zup"".

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which translates to ""red"", and the output is ""red"" again after ""wif"".

3. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"", so ""blue"" is repeated in the output.

4. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" again, and the output repeats ""blue"".

5. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow
   Similar to the previous instances, ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word before it. ""lug"" is ""blue"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color named by the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" implying that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" indicates repeating that color thrice.
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which means ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.
- ""dax lug wif walm"" provides ""green blue red red red,"" showing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word (""wif"" in this case) thrice.
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow,"" which confirms that ""walm"" is consistent in behavior - repeating the color associated with the directly preceding word. ""Zup"" introduces ""yellow,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" doesn't affect colors that are introduced after it.
- Finally, ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" meaning ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats that color thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-1.261197380764,124,walm
"The examples provided suggest that ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the analysis:

- ""wif walm"" becomes ""red red red"", where ""red"" comes from ""wif"" and is then repeated twice due to ""walm"".
- ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green"", with ""green"" coming from ""dax"" and repeated twice owing to ""walm"".
- ""dax lug wif walm"" leads to ""green blue red red red"", indicating that ""red"" from ""wif"" is repeated twice after ""walm"".
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"", showing that ""walm"" first triples ""green"" from ""dax"", and then triples ""red"" from ""wif"".
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"", with ""blue"" from ""lug"" being tripled due to ""walm"".

This consistency allows us to conclude that the meaning of ""dax"" is directly associated with the output ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that each time the word ""dax"" is used, it corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of whether ""dax"" is used alone or in a sequence with another word (e.g., ""lug""), the presence of ""dax"" always results in ""green"" being part of the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green.""

Therefore, the meaning can be inferred as:

dax -> green",-5.8978447119799995,125,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to compare inputs with their respective outputs:

1. dax wif bluf -> green red red
2. wif lug dax lug -> red blue green blue
3. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue
4. wif zup dax -> red yellow green
5. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green"" as well. Let's isolate the instances of ""wif"":

1. wif in ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to red
2. wif in ""wif lug dax lug"" corresponds to the first red
3. wif in ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to the first and third red
4. wif in ""wif zup dax"" corresponds to red
5. wif in ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to red

So based on the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-1.38628056377,125,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the output colors associated with it in various positions in the input, and see how it relates to the other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") and their respective output colors.

From the examples:

- When ""dax"" comes before ""wif,"" the output is ""green red"":
  - Input: dax wif -> Output: green red (Example 1)
  
- When ""wif"" comes before ""lug,"" the output is ""red blue"":
  - Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (Example 2, 3)
  
- When ""wif"" comes before ""dax,"" the output is ""red green"":
  - Input: wif dax -> Output: red green (Example 3, 4)
  
- When ""wif"" comes before ""zup,"" the output is ""red yellow"":
  - Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow (Example 4)

- When ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" the output is ""green red"":
  - Input: bluf wif -> Output: green red (Example 5)

From the above observations, we can infer the following about ""wif"":
- It comes before a word and always produces the output ""red"" regardless of the word that follows.
- The word that follows ""wif"" determines the second color of the output.

Thus, we can deduce that ""wif"" itself prompts the output color ""red"" and the subsequent color is determined by the word that comes after ""wif."" The other words (""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""zup"") produce ""green,"" ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, when they follow ""wif.""

Rule: wif -> meaning. ""wif"" causes the output ""red,"" and the following color output corresponds to the color represented by the next word in the sequence.",-2.5407189626379996,125,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is systematically associated with a specific color in the output. To determine the rule, let's look at each input/output pair:

1. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

2. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" corresponds to green.

4. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow based on position and ""dax"" corresponds to green.

5. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" corresponds to green, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Looking at the positions of ""wif"" and what they output, ""wif"" consistently outputs the color red, regardless of its position within the input, and independent of the words that come before or after it. All other words correspond to their respective colors, but only ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color red.

Therefore the rule is:

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word input is consistently transformed into a specific color in the output:

- ""dax"" consistently becomes ""green""
- ""bluf"" consistently becomes ""red""
- ""lug"" consistently becomes ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently becomes ""yellow""

With these consistent transformations, we can observe the input and outputs where ""wif"" is present:

- First example: ""wif"" is between ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" and it outputs ""red"" between ""green"" and ""red.""
- Second example: ""wif"" is in the first and third positions. When it's the first word, it outputs ""red,"" and when it's the third word, it outputs ""red"" again, before ""green.""
- Third example: ""wif"" is the second and fifth words, each time preceding ""dax"" and followed by ""lug,"" and it outputs ""red.""
- Fourth example: ""wif"" is the first word before ""zup"" and outputs ""red.""
- Fifth example: ""wif"" is the third word and outputs ""red.""

In every case, regardless of the position or adjacent words, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""

Rule: wif -> ""red""",-5.891788276474,125,wif

- In the second example, ""wif"" is again translated as ""red"".
- In the third example, both instances of ""wif"" result in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" also matches with ""red"".

Looking at these input-output pairs, every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is consistently ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

From the above examples, it can be observed that whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.

2. ""dax bluf"" outputs ""green green"", where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""bluf"" is also ""green"" when it follows ""dax"".

5. ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"", where ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" is ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup"".

From these examples, we can deduce a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" mirrors the color represented by the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore, based on the above rule:

bluf -> When following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means yellow.
bluf -> When following ""wif,"" which is not demonstrated, but would likely follow the established pattern, ""bluf"" would mean the color represented by ""wif.""

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is an additional ""yellow,"" which indicates repetition of the color associated with ""zup.""

"Rule: walm -> ""Repeat the color of the previous word one or more times""

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""lug dax walm"" translates to ""blue green green green green,"" which means ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (green) three times.

- In the second example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" gives ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

- In the third example, ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"". ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats its color (blue) twice.

- In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) twice.

- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" again ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

"Based on the provided examples, 'walm' seems to increment the output color associated with the following word. Each example has the word 'walm' followed by a color-coded word, and the output shows a repetition of that color. For instance:

- In the first example, 'dax' which is coded as green, follows 'walm', and the output is three greens in a row.
- In the second example, 'dax' follows 'walm' again and we see an additional green in the output sequence.
- The third example doesn't directly follow this pattern, but it can be inferred that 'lug', which follows 'walm' and is coded as blue, results in three blues in the output.
- The fourth example corroborates this, as 'zup' (yellow) follows 'walm' with three yellow outputs.
- The fifth example shows 'lug' (blue) following 'walm', and again there are three blues in the output, followed by 'wif' (red) with two reds which is likely due to 'bluf' being a nonce word and possibly indicating repetition or continuation.

- When ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is repetitive ""blue"" (Example 3 and Example 5).
- When ""walm"" is not followed by any other word, the repetition is of the immediate preceding color in the output (Example 4).

- In the third example, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow."" Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" appears to translate to ""yellow"" as well, given the context.

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf dax lug bluf"" translates to ""blue red red green blue blue."" ""Lug"" means ""blue,"" ""wif"" means ""red,"" ""bluf"" may mean ""red"" here, and ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

"To figure out the rule for ""bluf,"" we observe the relationship between the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. Here's a summary of the examples:

1. ""zup bluf dax lug"" -> ""yellow yellow green blue""
2. ""dax wif bluf"" -> ""green red red""
3. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" -> ""blue red red blue red""
4. ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green""
5. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""

Looking at the data, we can try to identify a pattern for ""bluf"":

In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" (same color as ""dax""). So, ""bluf"" might take on the color that follows it. 

However, in example 2, ""bluf"" doesn't have a word following it, yet the output is ""red."" This contradicts our initial guess.

In examples 3 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively, and the output is ""red"" for both, which doesn't align with ""lug"" (blue) or ""wif"" (red).

Example 4 is key: ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green."" Here ""wif"" and ""dax"" come before and after ""bluf,"" but the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which corresponds only with ""dax.""

Looking at all the patterns, we can conclude that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word that comes before it, but when ""bluf"" is the last word in the sequence, as in example 2, it defaults to ""red.""

Thus the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: 

Rule: bluf takes on the color of the word that directly precedes it in the sequence; if bluf appears at the end with no word following it, the output is ""red."" 

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: follow the color of the preceding word or default to red if there is no following word.",-1.1175382534499998,126,bluf
"Reviewing the examples, it appears that 'bluf' corresponds to a color. However, the color that 'bluf' corresponds to is not consistent across all examples. To deduce the rule, let's analyze when 'bluf' yields different colors:

- Example 1: zup bluf -> yellow yellow green blue
- Example 2: wif bluf -> red red
- Example 3: lug wif bluf lug -> blue red red blue
- Example 4: dax bluf -> green green
- Example 5: zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red red

If we examine what precedes 'bluf' in each example, it is notably a word that translates to a color. Based on these inputs and outputs, the rule seems to be that 'bluf' takes on the color of the word just before it. Thus, 'bluf' is a chameleon word that changes color based on the prior word.

Therefore, we can write the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is 'zup,' then 'bluf' yields yellow. If the preceding word is 'wif,' then 'bluf' yields red. If the preceding word is 'lug,' then 'bluf' is blue. If the preceding word is 'dax,' then 'bluf' is green. If a non-color word precedes 'bluf' (like 'walm' in the last example), 'bluf' repeats the color value of the last color word seen.",-5.90338326662,126,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's first examine each input/output pair, focusing on where ""bluf"" appears in the input and the corresponding output.

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   
2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
   
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Considering the examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not correspond consistently to a single color. Instead, its color changes. To find the rule, we need to look for a pattern that connects ""bluf"" with the words before or after it.

Noticing the examples, the color corresponding to ""bluf"" is not an arbitrary choice but rather seems to be a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""bluf"":

1. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is ""yellow.""
2. Before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" is ""red.""
3. Before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" again, it is ""red."" ""Bluf"" is ""red.""
4. Before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" ""Bluf"" is ""green.""
5. Before ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" is ""yellow.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" means the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.",-7.446625503738,126,bluf
"From the given examples, we can deduce that ""bluf"" correlates with a specific color output in the examples provided. Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a color output that does not match the colors corresponding to the other words (""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" ""walm""). Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" leads to the output ""blue,"" while ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Bluf"" is different from ""lug,"" even though they both correspond to ""blue""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" leads to red, which is the same as ""wif.""
- In the third example, ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" is again the same as ""wif,"" leading to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""green,"" which is the same color as ""dax.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" leads to ""red."" This time, ""bluf"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" adds to ""red.""

Combining these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" is not consistent in terms of a single color. However, a notable pattern is that ""bluf"" seems to adapt or change its output color. It doesn't have a single fixed color output like the other words do. Instead, ""bluf"" appears to take the color output that is immediately prior to its position. If a color is repeated directly before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" takes on that color. 

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word's corresponding color when the previous color is repeated; otherwise, it has its own color which seems to be ""green"".",-7.606333858331999,126,bluf
"To deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to find a pattern in the examples provided:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow green blue
2. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red
4. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

From these, we can try to identify a consistent mapping from input words to output colors.

We see the following mappings:
- ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" consistently maps to ""yellow.""

Now, let's look at the outputs for ""bluf"" in each example:
1. In the first example, ""bluf"" precedes ""dax"" and the output is ""yellow green."" Since we already know ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" in this context might map to ""yellow.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (""red"") and the output is ""red red."" This does not provide a clear rule for ""bluf"" since it could be interpreted as repeating the color of the previous word.
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""), and before ""bluf,"" we have ""wif"" (""red""). The output is ""red red blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" here might repeat the color of the word following it (blue).
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (""green""), and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which aligns with the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (""yellow"") and the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" also aligning with the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Combining these observations, it seems that the rule for ""bluf"" is that it repeats the color of the word before it. Therefore:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the preceding word.",-7.669788886109001,126,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can establish a few preliminary observations:

1. The output always contains a sequence of color words.
2. When the word ""walm"" is used, the output color appears to repeat.
3. The number of repeated colors is equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence + 1.

Using these observations to establish a rule, let's examine the examples more closely:

- Input: ""zup wif walm"" and Output: ""yellow red red red""
  Here, ""walm"" is in position 3, thus there are 3 ""red"" in the output plus the color corresponding to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

- Input: ""dax lug walm"" and Output: ""green blue blue blue""
  Similarly, ""walm"" is in position 3, resulting in 3 ""blue"" plus the color for ""dax"" which is ""green"".

- Input: ""zup walm"" and Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
  ""Walm"" is in position 2, leading to 2 ""yellow"", and no color before ""zup"" in this instance.

- Input: ""wif dax zup walm"" and Output: ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
  ""Walm"" is in position 4, so there are 4 ""yellow"" plus the colors for ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"" preceding them.

- Input: ""zup walm lug wif"" and Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
  ""Walm"" is in position 2, so there are 2 ""yellow"" following, and then the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""wif"".

Based on the above, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". The number of repetitions equals the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly before ""walm"" to repeat a number of times equal to its position in the input list.",-0.509135653337,126,walm
"Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the immediate preceding word three times.

From the examples given:

- ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red,"" hence ""walm"" takes the color before it (""wif"" corresponds to ""red"") and repeats it three times.
- ""dax lug walm"" gives ""green blue blue blue,"" following the same pattern - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- ""zup walm"" provides ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that the color corresponding to ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") is repeated three times.
- ""wif dax zup walm"" has an output of ""red green yellow yellow yellow,"" which again shows the color ""yellow"" corresponding to ""zup"" being repeated after ""walm.""
- ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" where the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times after ""walm,"" before continuing with the colors corresponding to ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""wif"" (""red"").",-0.86895395154,126,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeated color words from the preceding words. Each unique word before ""walm"" is matched to a specific color: 

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

When ""walm"" appears, it causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it for as many times as there are unique words preceding the word ""walm."" 

Let's apply this rule to the given examples to see if it holds up:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   - ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red) are the two words before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" refers to the last word ""wif"" translated as the color red, repeated once for each unique word before it.
   - Output: yellow red red red (Three instances of red for ""zup"" and ""wif"")

2. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   - ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue) before ""walm;"" ""walm"" refers to the last word ""lug"" translated as the color blue, repeated for each unique word before it.
   - Output: green blue blue blue (Three instances of blue for ""dax"" and ""lug"")

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   - ""zup"" (yellow) is the only word before ""walm,"" so ""walm"" refers to ""zup"" and repeats the color yellow once.
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow (Three instances of yellow for ""zup"")

4. Input: ""wif dax zup walm""
   - ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""zup"" (yellow) are before ""walm;"" ""walm"" refers to the last word ""zup"" translated as the color yellow, repeated for each unique word before it.
   - Output: red green yellow yellow yellow (Three instances of yellow for ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"")

5. Input: ""zup walm lug wif""
   - Since ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" with no other unique words in between, it repeats the color for ""zup"" three times.
   - Then we have ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red) following ""walm.""
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red (Three instances of yellow, then blue, then red)

The rule seems consistent with the provided examples. Therefore, we can infer the following rule for ""walm"":

Walm -> Repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word, for as many times as there are unique words preceding ""walm"".

Rule: If ""x"" is the word immediately before ""walm"" and ""x"" corresponds to a specific color, then ""walm"" produces that color repeated once for each unique word preceding ""walm.""",-2.8330605442470005,126,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three additional times. 

For instance:
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" with ""red"" being repeated because of ""wif.""
- ""dax lug walm"" becomes ""green blue blue blue,"" with ""blue"" being repeated because of ""lug.""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""yellow"" being the color associated with ""zup.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three additional times.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated a total of four times in the output.",-4.3560339538,126,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that ""walm"" corresponds to a series of colors that are repetitions of the color correlated to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" To elaborate:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated four times.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times.

From the fourth and fifth examples, we can also infer that other colors mentioned after ""walm"" are listed in order, unaffected by ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" for as many times as there are total words excluding ""walm"" after the preceding word.

- In the first input, the word 'bluf' is preceded by 'dax' and followed by 'wif'. The corresponding output sequence is ""green red green"". It's not immediately clear what 'bluf' corresponds to since we have two different colors flanking it.

- The second input consists of just 'wif bluf', with the output being ""red red"". Here, 'bluf' follows 'wif', and the output color for both is red.

- The third input consists of ‘zup bluf’ with the output ""yellow yellow"". Again, 'bluf' follows another word, this time 'zup', and the resulting color is the same for both.

- In the fourth input, 'bluf' is preceded by 'wif' and followed by 'dax'. The output sequence for these three is ""red red green"". Yet again, 'bluf' corresponds to red when followed by 'wif'.

- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" so the output is ""red."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" it results in ""green.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> replicate the color of the immediately preceding word.",-5.17468017276,127,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, bluf appears to be a nonce word that corresponds to the color that precedes it in the sequence. Each instance of bluf takes the color of the word right before it. To illustrate:

- In the first example, ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" bluf is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. Therefore, the output for bluf is green.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf,"" bluf is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. Therefore, the output for bluf is red.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf,"" bluf is preceded by ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. Therefore, the output for bluf is yellow.
- In the fourth example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" bluf is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to the color red. Consequently, the output for bluf is red.

This pattern is consistent across all given examples. Therefore, the rule for bluf can be deduced as follows:

"Considering the provided examples, each instance of ""walm"" appears to correspond to the repetition of the output color of the word directly preceding it. Observing the input and output pairs:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". After ""walm"" is said, there is a repetition of ""yellow"" (which is the color associated with ""zup"").
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is a repetition of ""yellow"" again.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". After ""walm"", there is an extra ""red"" in the output sequence.
- Lastly, in the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm"", there is an extra ""blue"" in the output sequence.

"Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that each occurrence of a color word (zup, bluf, lug, wif) corresponds to a specific color in the output (yellow, blue, blue, red).

Looking at the examples involving the word ""walm,"" we observe the following:

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (which corresponds to 'yellow') and the following color is 'yellow'.
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to 'yellow') again and the outputs are 'yellow' colors.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" (which corresponds to 'red') and the color that follows is again 'red'.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to 'blue') and the output is 'blue' colors.

From this, we can induce a possible rule that the word ""walm"" replicates the color word that precedes it. Whenever ""walm"" is present, it causes the color of the previous word to be repeated in the output.

- In the second and third examples with just ""zup"" and ""walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and again ""walm"" adds more ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" occurs at the end, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"" and then by an additional ""red"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color (before ""walm"") to repeat after the next color (after ""walm"").
- In the final example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which means ""blue"", and all output colors are ""blue"".

- In the second and third examples, 'walm' follows 'zup' and again produces yellow, the color associated with 'zup.'
- In the fourth example, 'walm' follows 'wif,' and the color for 'walm' is red, which is the color for 'wif.'

Output: red red green green red red red blue red

The word ""walm"" does not appear in any of the outputs, and thus its presence doesn't affect the sequence of colors. However, ""lug"" results in the output ""blue,"" and it's always followed by ""wif."" Examining the other inputs confirms the pattern that ""lug"" precedes another word and corresponds to ""blue.""

Comparing inputs containing 'lug' and their corresponding outputs, we can deduce a pattern. Every time 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' is part of the output sequence. Specifically, 'blue' appears right after the appearance of 'lug' in the output sequence:

- In the first example, 'lug' is followed by 'wif', and in the output, 'blue' is followed by 'red', which corresponds to 'wif'.
- In the second example, 'lug' appears at the end, and 'blue' is at the end of the output.

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (Note: This contradicts the previous example where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""blue"". It's possible that there's a typo or inconsistency in the examples. For this exercise, let's assume the color associated with ""bluf"" in this example is an error, and the correct output should be ""blue"" to maintain consistency.)

Input: lug zup dax zup -> Output: blue yellow green yellow

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

"Based on the given examples, we can induce the rule that each nonce word corresponds to a color. By examining the position and repetition of the word ""wif"" relative to other words and their associated colors, we aim to understand what ""wif"" represents.

Here is the analysis for each example:

Example 1:
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
- Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- The words ""lug"" and ""zup"" are consistently mapping to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. ""wif"" starts and ends the sequence, mapping to ""red"" initially and then ""red"" again when it repeats.

Example 2:
- Input: zup wif walm lug
- Output: yellow red red red blue
- Here, ""zup"" again maps to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""wif"" and ""walm"" are followed by ""red,"" but ""wif"" comes second, and ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow"" in the first example, which suggests ""walm"" is not consistently representing ""red"".

Example 3:
- Input: wif lug zup bluf
- Output: red blue yellow yellow
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"".

Example 4:
- Input: dax wif
- Output: green red
- ""dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""wif"" is followed by ""red"".

Example 5:
- Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
- Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""wif"", which appears at the end, to ""red"" once more.

There is a clear pattern where ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" whenever it appears in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-5.435328336742001,128,wif
"By examining the relationship between the input and output across all examples, we can infer that each input word is associated with a specific color in the output. Here's the mapping of input words to their respective output colors based on the examples:

- ""lug"" always maps to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" always maps to ""red"" when it occurs after ""wif,"" otherwise, it maps to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green.""
- ""wif"" itself does not have a consistent output color but seems to have an effect on the words that follow it.

Analyzing the pattern, particularly focusing on the outputs related to ""wif"":

- In example 1, ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue."" 
- In example 2, ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" and ""walm"" maps to ""red,"" not its usual ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue"" again.
- In example 4, ""wif"" is followed by no other words but maps to ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" is at the end after a series of other colors, but it maps to ""red.""

Given these observations, it appears that ""wif"" has two functions:

1. When ""wif"" stands alone, it maps to ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" precedes another word (like ""lug"" or ""walm""), it changes the color mapping of that following word.

In the case of ""walm,"" which consistently maps to ""yellow"" unless it follows ""wif,"" it is clear that ""wif"" causes a switch in ""walm"" to map to ""red"" instead.

However, ""lug"" is always blue, even when following ""wif."" Therefore, based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" causes ""walm"" to change color when it comes right after ""wif,"" but ""lug"" remains the same. 

We do not have enough data to make a definitive rule for what happens with other words following ""wif,"" as ""lug"" is the only word shown to follow ""wif"" more than once, and ""walm"" only changes color post ""wif.""

Using the given examples, the best rule we can formulate is:

Rule:
- wif -> When standing alone or at the last position, ""wif"" means ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" it changes ""walm"" to ""red."" 
- When ""wif"" precedes ""lug,"" there is no change in ""lug’s"" color, which remains ""blue.""

More examples would be needed to refine this rule further.",-6.690463688608,128,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns and occurrences of other words in the examples:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as in every instance it is present, ""blue"" is in the output.
3. ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" following the same logic.
4. ""walm"" isn't present in the second list, but in other examples, it might correspond to ""green"" or ""yellow"" (Example 1 and 5).
5. ""bluf"" and ""dax"" do not have enough occurrences to determine their meaning based just on these examples.

To simplify the analysis, let’s look at isolated occurrences of ""wif"":

- Example 4: ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" where ""wif"" is responsible for ""red.""
- Example 1: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" becomes ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red.""

When ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows. Thus, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" is associated with the word ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red",-7.180878717828,128,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we should compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to see how ""wif"" affects or relates to the output:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   
2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   
3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   
5. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red

By examining each input and output line, here are the observations:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" does not always appear at the beginning of the input sequence, and ""red"" does not always appear at the beginning of the output sequence, which suggests that ""wif"" does not simply translate to ""red."" It should be context-dependent.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is preceded by ""zup"" and is followed by ""walm lug."" In the output, ""red"" is followed by two ""red red"" which implies ""wif"" might mean ""extra"" or ""repeat"" since ""walm"" and ""lug"" both become ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is at the end, and it results in a single ""red"" after a series of ""green."" This might mean that ""wif"" repeats the sequence before it, as ""dax"" translates to ""green."" However, ""wif"" results in only one ""red,"" while ""dax"" appears multiple times before it, which can be confusing.

Given these observations, the most consistent rule that could explain each occurrence of ""wif"" is:

Rule: ""wif"" triggers the repeating of the last color mentioned in the sequence before ""wif.""

Let’s apply this rule to the examples to test its accuracy:

1. Before the first ""wif"" we have no colors, so ""wif"" could be interpreted as ""start with red"", for the second ""wif"" the last color mentioned is ""yellow,"" hence the output is ""yellow red"".
2. The last color before ""wif"" is ""yellow,"" so we get another ""red"" after it.
3. The last color before ""wif"" is again ""yellow,"" so we get a ""red"" after it.
4. The last color before ""wif"" is ""green,"" so we get ""red"" after it.
5. The last color before ""wif"" is ""green,"" so we get ""red"" after it.

However, there's a potential issue with this interpretation — it doesn’t perfectly explain why there's only one ""red"" in the output sequence when ""wif"" is used, as we might expect it to trigger a repeated ""green"" based on the rule proposed. Perhaps, there's an aspect to the rule where ""wif"" implies a change to ""red"" specifically, not merely a repetition of the last color.

After closer analysis, we can revise the rule to:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and indicates a change in the sequence rather than a repetition of the last mentioned color.

This revised rule is consistent with all examples provided. Let's summarize:

wif -> meaning. Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" indicating the presence of a new color or change in the sequence.",-10.69403473267,128,wif

Additionally, when it stands alone following ""wif"", it may just denote repeating the color red twice without requiring a word to repeat.

1. When ""lug walm"" is in the input, the output is always ""blue blue blue."" When ""lug"" is present without ""walm,"" it also results in ""blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

2. ""walm"" without ""lug"" or ""dax"" just precedes it seems to reproduce the color of the word just before it:

   - ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" resulted in ""blue blue blue green red blue red,"" where ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and ""green"" is introduced once ""dax"" appears.

3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" gives ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" may introduce ""green,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" the ""blue"" from ""lug"" is repeated.

- When ""walm"" is present in the input, it seems to repeat the color output related to the word that comes before it, unless it is after ""dax,"" which results in all ""green.""

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking for patterns in the input and output:

- In the first example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" consistently, ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Here, ""bluf"" results in ""green"", which is a change from the first example.
- In the third example, we again see ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The word ""bluf"" results in ""red"", which is similar to the first example.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" once again translates to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". Here ""bluf"" comes out as ""blue"", which is a different result compared to previous examples.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" to ""red"". And ""bluf"" results in a ""yellow"" output, again different from the previous cases.

When examining these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent single color output but instead might be reflecting the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In example 1, there is no color before ""bluf"", so it defaults to ""red"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", which is ""green"", so ""bluf"" results in ""green"".
- In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" results in ""red"". Here one might initially theorize that ""bluf"" is yellow as well; however, the Output does not reflect this (unless there is a mistake in the Output).
- In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which is ""blue"", so ""bluf"" results in ""blue"".
- In example 5, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", which is ""yellow"", so ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"".

The presence of a discrepancy in the third example makes it challenging to conclude with certainty, but based on the other four examples, the tentative rule for ""bluf"" could be that it takes the color of the immediately preceding word. However, with the conflicting input from example 3, this rule cannot be fully confirmed.

Potential rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it (with uncertainty due to an inconsistency in example 3).

Further examples would be needed to refine this rule with more certainty.",-5.350768089821999,129,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, 'bluf' correlates to the duplication of the color word that immediately follows it when it is present, except when there is no color word after 'bluf'. In examples where 'bluf' is followed by a color word, that color word is repeated in the output. 

In the first example, 'wif,' which corresponds to the color 'red,' is repeated in the output as ""red red"" after the word 'bluf'. In the second example, 'bluf' is followed by 'wif' which again translates to ""red red"" in the output. In the third example, 'bluf' is once again followed by 'wif' (red), resulting in ""red red.""

From the fifth example, we cannot deduce a concrete rule for 'bluf' followed by 'walm' (or 'wif), since it introduces a non-repeated 'red' after two 'yellow's, which doesn't follow the established pattern of direct repetition.

Therefore, the best induction based on the available information is:

Rule: 'bluf' -> Repeat the color word that immediately follows it. If 'bluf' is at the end of the sequence or is not followed by a recognizable color word, it translates to 'blue'.",-8.438027134059999,129,bluf

"Using the examples provided, we can attempt to infer the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

In the first example, ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of ""blue"" repeated three times. To confirm, let's look at other examples.

In the second example, ""walm"" appears between ""lug"" and ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax."" The corresponding output is two instances of ""blue"" and then a sequence of colors that do not include ""blue"" until ""dax,"" which is ""green."" This suggests that ""walm"" might relate to repeating the color that comes after it until a different color (or ""word"") appears.

In the third example, ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" Here, ""green"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated three times. If ""walm"" meant to repeat the following color three times, this would be consistent with our observation from the first example.

In the fourth example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to a sequence that includes ""red red green green red red red blue red."" The ""walm"" here is followed by ""lug"" and then ""wif,"" where the color ""blue"" appears only once after the three ""reds,"" suggesting that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to repeat once in this context based on its positioning.

In the final example, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green."" ""Walm"" is surrounded by ""lug"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Walm"" precedes the ""blue"" sequence and is followed by ""green.""

Combining our observations from the examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word just after ""walm"" to be repeated three times. It seems to act as a multiplier for the next color word.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat three times.

This would mean for each sequence where ""walm"" is present:
- ""lug walm zup"" has the blue corresponding to ""lug"" repeated due to ""walm"" and then ""yellow"" for ""zup.""
- ""zup lug walm wif dax"" sees ""walm"" making ""blue,"" which comes after it for ""lug,"" repeated, before continuing with the sequence.
- ""dax walm"" has ""green"" repeated three times due to ""walm.""
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" is a bit more complex but since ""walm"" comes after ""wif,"" but because ""lug"" comes immediately after ""walm,"" it causes ""blue"" to appear before continuing with ""red"" for ""wif.""
- ""lug walm dax"" simply repeats ""blue"" for ""lug"" because of ""walm"" before ending with ""green"" for ""dax.""

So: walm -> causes the next color word to be repeated three times.",-3.6239882887999997,129,walm

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". ""walm"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in this case.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"". ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Given that ""walm"" follows and the output is still ""green,"" this suggests that ""walm"" is repeating the color associated with the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"". The occurrence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in ""red,"" but ""walm"" after ""lug"" gives us ""blue"". This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"". Here again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""blue"".

Taking into account all examples, we can conclude the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If there is no preceding word, default to ""blue"" as seen in the first example.

2. Second example:

5. Fifth example:
Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
Here, ""walm"" is following ""lug"" again, and the output is ""blue"" again for ""walm.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it correlates with the color ""red"" when it precedes a word.

- ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
- ""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red""
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red""

It appears that whenever ""wif"" is present, the pattern it follows is that it results in ""red"" in the output.

To affirm this pattern, we can look at situations where ""wif"" is not present and see if ""red"" ever shows up without ""wif"":

- ""dax walm"" turns into ""green green green""
- ""bluf"" results in ""red"" but ""wif"" follows ""lug"" in the input, it seems to contribute the second ""red"" in the output pattern

From these patterns, it seems reasonable to conclude that ""wif"" directs the system to output ""red"".

In example 2, after ""lug walm wif walm,"" the output sequence shows ""blue blue blue red red red."" We can see that ""walm"" after ""wif"" changes the repetition pattern of colors; it triples the output color of ""wif"" (red in this case). In example 3, despite having an extra word ""dax"" that outputs to ""green,"" after ""wif"" we still get a single ""red"" and not three, disproving the initially assumed rule of ""wif"" tripling the next color.

In example 4, ""lug wif"" outputs to ""blue red red,"" which means ""wif"" doubles the color in this case as there is no word after ""wif"" to be tripled.

Example 5 has ""wif"" as the last word, outputting only one ""red.""

The only consistent observation is that ""wif"" directly translates to ""red."" Where ""wif"" appears more than once, or is followed by certain words, there might be additional rules affecting the number of repetitions and the sequence of the output colors, but these are not consistent or clear based on the given examples.

Rule: wif -> red",-8.466660460356,130,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Here's how we can deduce this:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" We know zup is yellow and wif is red, so bluf seems to repeat the color of wif.

2. In the second example, ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" Bluf repeats the color of zup, which is yellow.

3. In the third example, ""wif zup dax bluf,"" the output is ""red yellow green green."" We can surmise that dax is green, and bluf repeats this color.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" It confirms that bluf repeats the color of the preceding word, which in this case is zup (yellow).

5. In the fifth example, ""wif bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" Again, bluf repeats the color of wif, which is red.

Examples to support the rule induction:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the color yellow is repeated (since ""zup"" corresponds to yellow).
- When ""dax"" is not directly before ""bluf"" but ""zup"" or ""wif"" is, we still see the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".

Therefore, bluf -> a repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word.",-4.838844723019999,130,bluf
"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by looking at the outputs for common input patterns:

1. Every time ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow"" for ""zup"" and another ""yellow"" for ""bluf"".
2. When ""bluf"" occurs without ""zup"" before it, the output for ""bluf"" is ""red"".
3. The occurrence of other words before ""bluf"", like ""wif"" or ""dax,"" does not seem to affect the color output for ""bluf."" However, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red"" and ""dax"" consistently results in ""green.""

Considering these observations:

- ""wif"" likely translates to ""red"".
- ""zup"" likely translates to ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" likely translates to ""green"".
- ""bluf"" seems to be ""yellow"" when following ""zup"", otherwise ""red"".

Using these deductions, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: bluf translates to ""yellow"" if it appears immediately after ""zup""; in all other instances, it translates to ""red"".",-5.008568404769999,130,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, we can induce that the word ""bluf"" is repeated once for every other word that precedes it in the input sequence.

For example:
- In the first input ""zup wif bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""zup"" and ""wif"" are two words that precede ""bluf.""
- In the second input ""zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" because there is only one word ""zup"" before it, so ""bluf"" is repeated once.
- In the third input ""wif zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""green green"" because there are three words before ""bluf.""
- In the fourth input ""wif dax zup bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" for a similar reason as above - the position of ""zup"" determines the color, and since there are three words before ""bluf,"" it is repeated twice.
- In the fifth input ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because there is one word preceding it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" reflects the color associated with the words before it, repeated once for each word.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. For instance, ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"".

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that precedes it. Here's the breakdown of each example:

- ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" causes the word ""wif"" (red) to be repeated twice more, for a total of three instances of ""red.""
- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which implies that ""walm"" causes the word ""dax"" (green) to be repeated twice more, for a total of three instances of ""green.""
- ""dax wif walm"" leads to ""green red red red,"" showing that ""walm"" applies only to the last word before it, which is ""wif"" (red), resulting in three instances of ""red"" following the ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax.""

"Analyzing the input-output patterns, we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" based on its placement within different strings of words and their corresponding color outputs.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" corresponds to blue, and since ""zup"" is the third word and the color changes, it is reasonable to infer that ""zup"" produces the color yellow.

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- The string starts with ""zup"" which gives yellow, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" to blue, ""walm"" to blue again, followed by another ""zup"" which also produces yellow, and ""lug"" produces a blue.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" starts and is followed by yellow, ""bluf"" does not have an established color but is followed by another yellow, suggesting ""bluf"" may be ""zup"" or has the same color output as ""zup"". ""lug"" corresponds to blue, followed by ""zup"" which is followed by yellow.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""zup"" to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""bluf"" also to green which suggests ""bluf"" is green.

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, followed by another ""zup"" which is also yellow, and ""wif"" gives red.

From these examples, the rule for ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.

However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the third example where ""bluf"" leads to a string of ""yellow"" in the output rather than a single ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" could possibly have a rule that involves repeating the subsequent color, but this theory does not hold consistently across all examples.

Given only the examples provided and no additional context or patterns detected, the simplest rule deduced is:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-5.91850236642,131,zup
"Based on the examples given, we can deduce the following:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""

In each line, ""zup"" seems to precede a color, and that color is the output right after ""zup."" For example:

- In the first input, ""zup"" is followed by ""blue"" as the output.
- In the second input, ""zup"" is followed by ""blue"" the first time and ""yellow"" the second time, respecting the colors that follow them in the sequence.
- In the fifth input, ""zup"" is followed by ""green"" and then by ""red"" in accordance with the colors represented by ""dax"" and ""wif.""

However, in the third example, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" instead of green as one might presume from the other examples, and ""zup"" in this case is followed by ""yellow."" This could imply ""zup"" takes the color value of the following word except when it's the first or last word. When it's the first word in a sequence, it outputs ""yellow,"" and when it's the last word, it repeats the last color value before it.

If we were to formulate a rule based on this analysis, it would be:

Rule: ""zup"" takes the color of the next word in sequence, except when ""zup"" is at the beginning it defaults to ""yellow"" or when ""zup"" is at the end, in which case it repeats the last color value that appears before it.

Here are some observations:
- ""zup"" at the beginning or in between other words translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" does not seem to be associated with any word that follows or precedes it in a consistent manner to give it a different color meaning.

Given these observations, we can induce a simple rule:

2. The word ""zup"" appears to behave independently of its position in the input string.

Therefore, ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"". It is also important to note that other words like ""lug"", ""walm"", ""dax"", ""bluf"", and ""wif"" have their own color mappings, which are consistent when ""zup"" is not present.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.",-9.851345354820001,131,zup
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" aligns with the output color that directly precedes it in the input. By observing the corresponding output for each appearance of ""bluf,"" we can deduce the following pattern:

- ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""zup lug bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow blue blue yellow yellow red"" means that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" when it follows ""zup.""
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" again shows that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""

From the above, it is observed that ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is as follows:

4. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Focusing on the appearances of ""bluf"" and its translation:

4. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" the output is yellow:

- In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears twice: after ""lug"" and ""zup,"" corresponding to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

As seen in these examples, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it mimics the color associated with the word that comes right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color meaning of the preceding word.",-4.70581725436,131,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we first look at the correlation between the input and the output in the given examples. Each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. By comparing the inputs with their outputs, we can analyze what ""bluf"" corresponds to:

2. In the second example, ""bluf"" again translates to blue, following ""lug"" but preceding ""wif.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif"" and translates to red.
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" translates to blue when it follows ""lug"" and to yellow when it follows ""zup."" 
5. The fifth example is identical to the third, reinforcing the translation of ""bluf"" as red after ""wif.""

When looking for a pattern, we notice that ""bluf"" always takes the same color as the word immediately preceding it:

- When preceding ""wif"" its color is red, as is ""wif.""
- When following ""dax"" its color is green, the same as ""dax.""
- When following ""lug"" its color is blue, the same as ""lug.""
- When following ""zup"" its color is yellow, the same as ""zup.""

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The output for ""bluf"" does not produce a new or unique color but rather repeats the color of the previous word.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be consistent. The word ""bluf"" translates to the word ""blue"" in English.

Rule: bluf -> blue",-9.29440401568,132,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the patterns in the examples given:

- When ""dax"" is present, the output often starts with green.
- When ""lug"" is present, the output often starts with blue.
- When ""zup"" is present, the output often starts with yellow.
- When ""wif"" is present, the output contains red.
- When ""bluf"" is present, the corresponding output is blue.

Now, let's evaluate the examples involving ""walm"":

1. ""dax walm zup"" leads to ""green green green yellow""; ""walm"" seems to trigger an extra green before ending with the color for ""zup"" (yellow).
2. ""lug walm wif bluf"" results in ""blue blue blue red red""; here ""walm"" results in two additional blues, and then follows the pattern for ""wif"" (red) and ""bluf"" (blue).
3. ""dax wif walm"" produces ""green red red red""; “walm” here adds two more reds after ""wif"" has set the red color.
4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" gives ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue""; ""walm"" introduces two additional yellows after ""zup"" before adopting the pattern for ""lug.""
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" yields ""yellow yellow red red red""; ""walm"" adds an extra red after the pattern for ""wif.""

From these patterns, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color indicated by the word before it except in the first example where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" yet it creates a repetition of the color that corresponds with ""dax,"" which is green.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word except if preceded by ""dax,"" in which it may not relate directly to the word immediately before it but rather to the color associated with ""dax"" (green). 

However, since we only have one example with ""dax"" before ""walm,"" the specific rule for ""dax"" may need more examples to be more confidently deduced. Considering this, a possible general rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color output of the preceding word one or more times.",-0.9474353686900001,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs carefully. Let's look at each example to try to find a rule.

1. dax walm zup -> green green green yellow
2. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
3. dax wif walm -> green red red red
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Considering the word ""walm"" and the color after it:

- In the first example, zup follows walm and outputs yellow.
- In the second example, wif leads to the output red, and it comes after walm.
- In the third example, walm is at the end, and the output is red.
- In the fourth example, walm is followed by lug, which outputs blue.
- In the fifth example, walm is at the end again, and the output is red.

The pattern seems to suggest that when ""walm"" is followed by another word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the following word. When ""walm"" is at the end, the output is red.

Let's formalize this rule:

Rule: ""walm"" seems to function as a placeholder for the next color in the sequence, changing its output to match the color associated with the following word. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, then the output is red.

So:

walm -> if followed by a word, the color of that word; if not followed by any word, red.",-1.0201217307000001,132,walm
"Reviewing the provided examples, each instance of the ""walm"" word seems to be associated with a series of colors in the output. Here's what is observed from the examples:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green yellow.""
2. When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif bluf,"" the output is ""blue blue blue red red.""
3. When ""walm"" follows ""dax wif,"" the output is ""green red red red.""
4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug bluf dax lug zup,"" the output is ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
5. When ""walm"" follows ""zup bluf wif,"" the output is ""yellow yellow red red red.""

The pattern appears to be that ""walm"" duplicates the color that directly precedes it three times and adds one additional color (yellow or red) if the color before walm is green or red, respectively. If the pattern preceding walm is blue or yellow, it duplicates the same color pattern three times, followed by a similar color (blue or yellow).

With this inference, the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> replicate the color that directly precedes it three times and then add a color: if the preceding color is green or red, add yellow or red accordingly; if the preceding color is blue or yellow, continue the color pattern with blue or yellow, respectively.",-1.517613560584,132,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the given translations that include the nonce word and compare them with the outputs.

- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to ""red"" when following ""walm"" but to ""blue"" elsewhere. 

When ""walm"" is present, every word following ""walm"" (in the same list of input words) translates into red, regardless of what the word typically translates to:

- In the first example, ""zup"" translates to yellow when it precedes ""walm,"" but in the last example, when ""zup"" follows ""walm,"" it translates to red.
- This pattern also holds for ""wif"" and ""bluf,"" which become red following ""walm.""
- If ""walm"" is the last word in the input list, there are no words following it, and therefore, we don't see any additional words being translated to red.

From these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in a list, any word that follows ""walm"" is translated to ""red,"" regardless of its usual color translation.",-9.281314765580001,132,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs where ""walm"" is present:

1. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
3. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red

Analyzing the patterns, we note that:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" The output includes an additional ""green"" before shifting to the next color, ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" The output includes two additional ""blue"" before shifting to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and follows ""dax."" In the output, we see two additional ""red"" after ""green"" before we see one more ""red.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence that includes multiple colors. ""lug"" precedes and follows ""walm."" The output includes two ""yellow"" before another ""blue,"" which is the color corresponding to ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output shows two additional ""red"" colors after the rest of the pattern.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" after a word causes the output to repeat the corresponding color for that word an additional two times before shifting to the next color in sequence, or in the case of the last word, it repeats the last color before ending or transitioning.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the output color corresponding to that word is repeated two additional times before continuing with the sequence.

- ""zup dax bluf"" yielded ""yellow green green""; similarly, ""bluf"" takes on the same color as the word preceding it.

- In the third example, ""dax walm"" yields ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" might be green, and ""walm"" again adds repetitions of the same color.
- The fourth example again shows ""walm"" following a color word (like ""lug"" and ""wif"") and results in repetitions of the same color. ""Zup lug walm wif walm"" translates to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeating the previous color.
- In the final example, ""zup walm"" turns into ""yellow yellow yellow,"" adhering to the pattern that ""walm"" repeats whatever the previous color was three times.

Considering the above patterns, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. When ""walm"" follows a color word, it repeats that color word three times in the output.",-4.618113995869999,133,walm
"Examining the given inputs and their corresponding outputs, it appears that 'walm' can be interpreted as a repetition of the immediately preceding color word's output, continuing for a number of times that match the number of characters in the last color word mentioned. Here's the application of this rule to the given examples:

1. ""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and since ""wif"" has three letters, ""walm"" resulted in ""red"" being repeated three times.

2. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" has the ""walm"" after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Zup"" has three letters, yielding ""yellow"" repeated three times, followed by the ""lug"" after ""walm"" which corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""dax walm"" directly led to ""green green green"" as ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""dax"" has three letters, resulting in the color ""green"" being repeated three times.

4. With ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" we first see ""zup lug walm,"" which gives ""yellow blue blue blue"" - ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and since it has three letters, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times. Then ""wif walm"" follows the same logic as before – ""wif"" equals ""red,"" which is repeated three times as per ""wif"" featuring three letters.

5. In ""zup walm,"" again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and as it has three letters, ""yellow"" is said three times.

Therefore, based on the examples provided:

Rule: **walm** -> Repeat the color of the immediately preceding color word. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of letters in that color word.",-6.147521447040001,133,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to determine the number of output colors and the color to be repeated. Here is the analysis:

1. The first color (word) before ""walm"" sets the color to be repeated. 
2. The repetition count for the color is equal to the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence (i.e., if ""walm"" is the third word in the input, the chosen color repeats three times in the output).

For example:
- In ""zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" (red) is the third word thus repeated three times.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" (yellow) is the fifth word thus repeated twice before moving on to the next word ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax walm"", ""dax"" (green) is the first word thus repeated three times (since the output's total length is three) .
- In ""zup lug walm wif walm"", the first ""walm"" makes ""lug"" (blue) repeat three times, then ""wif"" (red) is repeated twice after the second ""walm"".
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" (yellow) is the first word and thus repeated three times (since the output's total length is three).

Using this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the word immediately preceding it to be repeated as a color in the output, with the number of repetitions equal to the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence. If ""walm"" is at the end or there are no words following it, extend the output to a total of three colors.",-7.471793543640001,133,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the correlation between the input and the output in the given examples.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In this example, the word ""walm"" appears at the end and corresponds to three instances of ""red"" in the output.

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and before the last ""lug."" We see two ""yellow"" before a ""blue"" occurs, matching the pattern before and after ""walm.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

In this example, the word ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" There are no other words to compare before ""walm,"" yet the output gives three ""green.""

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

""Walm"" appears twice, with different preceding words (""lug"" and ""wif""). Before the first ""walm,"" we have ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" and the output contains repeated ""blue"" after. Before the second ""walm,"" we have ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and the output has three ""red"" after it.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" and we see three instances of ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to triple the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it. If ""zup"" (yellow) comes before ""walm,"" then the output is three yellows. If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""walm,"" the output is three blues. If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm,"" the output is three greens, and if ""wif"" (red) comes before it, the output is three reds.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the examples given and the colors associated with the words that follow ""dax.""

Examining the sequences and their outputs:

1. dax -> green
    zup -> yellow
    walm -> yellow
    wif -> red

2. dax -> green
    wif -> red

3. dax -> green
    bluf -> green
    wif -> red
    zup -> yellow
    wif -> red

4. dax -> green
    lug -> blue
    wif -> red

5. dax -> green
    wif -> red
    bluf -> red

From these sequences, we observe the following:

- ""dax"" invariably results in ""green.""
- The color following ""dax"" seems unrelated to the word that comes after ""dax,"" suggesting that ""dax"" itself induces the color ""green"" regardless of its position or the words that follow.
- Other words, like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug,"" produce different colors, but the color ""red"" is consistent for ""wif"" regardless of its position.

Based on the given examples, the rule for ""dax"" is consistent in producing the color green. Other words seem to have their own associated colors, but for the purpose of this task, we are only concerned with the meaning of ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""",-3.571718756106,134,dax
"Based on the given examples, ""dax"" appears to function as a signal or command that affects the output color sequence. To deduce the meaning or rule behind ""dax"" we'll need to look at the transformation from the inputs to outputs and focus on their relationship to ""dax.""

- Whenever ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input, the first output color is always ""green.""
- The other words following ""dax"" are associated with certain colors in the output, regardless of their position relative to ""dax.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
  - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" unless it follows ""dax,"" in which case it turns the subsequent ""wif"" red.
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Considering these observations, it seems that ""dax"" acts as a default initiator translating to ""green,"" followed by a sequence of colors corresponding to the words after it. The word ""dax"" itself does not modify the color associated with the following words apart from setting the initial output to ""green.""

So, the rule would be: 

Rule: When an input sequence begins with ""dax,"" the first output color is ""green."" Then, subsequent colors correspond to specific words following ""dax"" with the associations defined above.",-5.194469403579999,134,dax
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'dax', let us examine the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: dax wif | Output: green red
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif | Output: green green red yellow red
4. Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
5. Input: dax wif bluf | Output: green red red

From these examples, 'dax' always results in 'green'. This is consistent across all given examples, suggesting that 'dax' could indicate the color 'green'.

Now, we need to test the rule where 'dax' means 'green' against the given outputs:

- 'dax' is always followed by 'green'.
- Other words following 'dax' result in a variety of colors, but 'dax' itself is unwaveringly correlated with 'green'. 

Therefore, based on the examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green",-6.191686543475,134,dax
"To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the examples and find patterns associated with each occurrence of the word.

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

2. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
   Output: green green red yellow red

4. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

5. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

Looking at these examples, the following patterns emerge:

- Every ""dax"" is followed by the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""
- ""bluf,"" when following ""dax,"" gives a ""green"" but turns ""red"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""
- ""lug,"" when following ""dax,"" gives a ""blue.""

Since ""dax"" initiates a new sequence and is consistently followed by ""green,"" it is possible that ""dax"" indicates the start of a new color sequence. From the patterns above, it appears that each word following ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color, potentially except for ""dax"" itself which may simply be an indicator of the beginning of a sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""dax"" can be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""dax"" signals the beginning of a color sequence and is always followed by the color ""green"" in the output. Each word following ""dax"" is then translated to a respective color based on a predefined mapping.

Therefore, we can deduce:
dax -> signals the beginning of a color sequence; always outputs green as the first color.",-6.293280695652,134,dax
"dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.",-8.18881990464,134,dax

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. In the first example, ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""red.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue."" Similarly, ""bluf"" matches up with the second ""red.""

3. The third example, ""zup bluf dax lug,"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue."" Again, ""bluf"" aligns with the second ""yellow.""

4. In the fourth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" becomes ""red red blue yellow."" ""Bluf"" is linked with the second ""red.""

5. Finally, the fifth example, ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" corresponds to ""red red yellow yellow red."" Both instances of ""bluf"" match up with either the second ""red"" or the second ""yellow.""

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs.

- ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" must therefore have a pattern resulting in ""blue blue.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" translates to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" In this instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The only unaccounted for output is the ""yellow yellow yellow"" at the end, which corresponds to ""walm.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" yields ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" where once again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has not been previously defined but gives an output ""blue"" which is consistent with ""lug."" Thus, ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue blue.""
- ""lug walm"" gives ""blue blue blue."" We've compared ""lug"" to ""blue"" earlier, so ""walm"" again results in ""blue blue.""
- ""zup wif walm"" turns into ""yellow red red red."" From prior examples, ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" The word ""walm"" here corresponds with ""red red.""

So, ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word immediately preceding it, producing that color twice in succession in the output.

   - The last word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"".
   - Following ""zup"" is ""walm"", and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times. 

3. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf

   - Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"". But ""wif"" does not affect the output of ""walm"", as it follows ""walm"".

- When ""dax"" is preceded by other words (""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""walm"") and followed by ""zup,"" the color ""green"" still appears in the output at the position corresponding to ""dax.""

"Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". Here's how it breaks down:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" becomes ""yellow yellow green blue"". The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". This doesn't specifically help with the word ""bluf"" but it does establish that ""wif"" corresponds to red, which is consistent in other examples.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue"", reinforcing the association of ""bluf"" with blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red"". Here, ""zup"" means yellow, and ""wif"" means red. This reinforces earlier observations but does not add new information about ""bluf"".

5. The fifth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", translates to ""blue red blue green green"". The only new word before the colors change is ""bluf"", which again corresponds with the color blue.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue.",-1.03613834034,135,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to a color, but the specific color it translates to changes depending on the context. Let's look at each example to deduce the rule:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue"". We see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" in this context is followed by ""dax"" which is translated as ""green,"" ""bluf"" here is translated to ""yellow,"" the color preceding ""dax.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". ""Wif"" is ""red,"" so ""bluf"" also translates to ""red"" here.
- In the third example, ""zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" which is ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red."" ""Zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" here takes the color of ""wif,"" which is the word immediately preceding it.
- In the fifth example, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue red blue green green."" Here ""bluf"" takes the color of ""dax"" which is ""green.""

The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that either immediately precedes or follows it, depending on the context. However, there seems to be an inconsistency with the first example when applying this rule.

Given this inconsistency, one possible rule that could fit all the examples might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word that follows it if there is one; if ""bluf"" is the last word, it takes the color of the word preceding it.

Thus:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the following word, or if it is the last word, the preceding word.",-1.24339434594,135,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to have a dynamic meaning that changes depending on the context of the word preceding it. To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the output for each input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug | Output: yellow yellow green blue
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow) and precedes ""dax"" (which is green). However, ""bluf"" itself translates to blue, not a blend of yellow and green.

2. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (which is red) and the output for ""bluf"" is red as well, matching the color of the word before it.

3. Input: zup bluf lug | Output: yellow yellow blue
   - Similar to example 1, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) but translates to blue, not influenced by the colors around it.

4. Input: zup wif bluf | Output: yellow red red
   - ""Bluf"" comes after ""wif"" (which is red) and takes on the color of the word immediately before it, which is red.

5. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf | Output: blue red blue green green
   - Here, ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" (green) and takes on the color of green accordingly.

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that the word ""bluf"" translates to the same color as the word that directly precedes it. When ""bluf"" follows a color word, it takes on the color of that word in the output.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word that precedes it. If no color word precedes it, or the context is unclear, further examples would be needed to establish the default rule for ""bluf"". In these examples, the rule is consistent.",-5.585548291285,135,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color spoken immediately before the word ""bluf."" To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we follow the pattern where the color word that comes right before it is repeated in the output, with ""bluf"" itself being translated to the color that should have followed if the pattern had continued. It appears that ""bluf"" functions as an indicator to repeat the previously mentioned color in the pattern. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to blue, and since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" outputs blue.
- In the second example, no color comes before ""bluf,"" so the pattern cannot be established, giving us two reds, which seems to default when there is no previous color.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and since ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" ""bluf"" outputs blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" outputs red.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and since ""bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" outputs green.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be: ""Repeat the color corresponding to the word that precedes 'bluf.'""

"From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, three times. Here's the breakdown:

- ""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red"", where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and ""walm"" causes it to be repeated three times.
- ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue"". The word ""zup"" is before ""walm"" and corresponds to ""yellow"", so ""walm"" causes it to repeat three times.
- ""zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow red red red"" with ""wif"" before ""walm"" being associated with ""red"" and repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green"", indicating that ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" has caused it to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> causes the next color word to repeat three times.",-1.311686587978,135,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Each word appears to be associated with a specific color:

- ""lug"" is associated with blue.
- ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""bluf"" is associated with green.
- ""zup"" is associated with yellow.
- ""dax"" is associated with green.

""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""walm"" causes the color blue to be repeated three times.

""lug wif walm"" results in ""blue red red red,"" where ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""wif"" with red, and ""walm"" causes the color red to be repeated three times as it is the immediate predecessor to ""walm.""

Observing the redundancy in output where the color green and blue are involved, we can make a further inference. ""dax"" and ""bluf"" produce the color green, and the ""walm"" that follows repeats this color green three times. This suggests a pattern where ""walm"" consistently causes a tripling of the color associated with the immediately preceding word without a distinct difference being made between the words that trigger the color.

Hence the rule is as follows:

- In the second example, ""dax walm zup lug walm"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""walm"" appears twice, and for each occurrence, there are two ""greens"" in the output. This could suggest that ""walm"" corresponds to two repetitions of ""green,"" indicating a doubling rule.
  
- In the third example, ""dax lug dax"" corresponds to ""green blue green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" consistently, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green,"" which fits with the previous doubling rule suggested by the appearance of ""walm.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" There is no context where ""dax"" correlates with any output other than ""green."" Therefore, we can conclude the following:

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color associated with the immediately preceding word. This is evident as each time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of the color generated by the previous word.

Here are the specific rules we can deduce from each line of your examples:

1. ""lug walm wif zup wif"" -> ""blue blue blue red yellow red""
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and the output is ""blue blue,"" indicating repetition.

2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

5. ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color code of the immediately preceding word.",-1.119810612398,137,walm
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the previous word until a new color is introduced. Here are the rules as I understand them:

- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""bluf"" was not individually translated, but since it precedes ""lug"" and the output after ""bluf"" includes yellow before turning to blue (associated with ""lug""), we might assume it corresponds to yellow as well.

Now let's see how ""walm"" operates within this context:

In the first example:
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" results in ""blue blue blue red yellow red"".
The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats the color blue until a new instruction is given by ""wif"" (red).

In the second example:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"".
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and simply repeats the color yellow.

In the third example:
- ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"".
After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" repeats yellow until ""dax"" introduces a new color, green.

In the fourth example:
- ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue"".
Following ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats the color blue after the initial green from ""dax"".

Lastly, in the fifth example:
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"".
This is consistent with ""walm"" repeating the color blue associated with ""lug"" after ""zup"" and ""bluf"".

- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is consistently yellow, corresponding to ""zup,"" after ""walm.""
- In the third example, after ""zup walm,"" all outputs are yellow until ""dax"" appears, which changes the sequence to green.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and the output after ""walm"" is blue, repeating the color associated with ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" again precedes ""walm,"" and following ""walm,"" we have repeated instances of blue, which is the color for ""lug.""

- ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red""

Assuming ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to the colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively, as seen where they are the solitary word or the immediate repetition of the word reflects the immediate repetition of the color, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with ""red.""

Additionally, we can see a pattern where ""wif"" appears to generate multiple ""red"" outputs when preceded or followed by certain other words. The number of ""red"" outputs seems to match the total number of words following ""wif,"" including ""wif"" itself, up until a new word that has a different corresponding color is introduced or the sequence ends.

Let's describe it in terms of the rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"", and it induces a sequence of ""red"" that matches the number of immediately following words until a word with a different color output is encountered or the sequence terminates.

Using these observations, we define:

wif -> red

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" produces the output ""red"". This is consistent in every example where ""wif"" is present. Here are the occurrences:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" -> ""green green green red red red""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
- ""dax wif"" -> ""green red""

Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"" appearing in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence or the other words around it.

Looking at the patterns, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color ""red"" directly follows in the output, with one exception: in the first line, ""bluf"" is followed by ""blue."" The context of ""bluf"" also does not seem to change its output— ""bluf"" always corresponds to either ""red"" or ""blue,"" regardless of the words around it. It looks like ""bluf"" correlates with ""red,"" but it does not explain why it is ""blue"" in the first example. There is no visible pattern that links ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" or any other colors.

This irregularity in the first example could be a result of a mistake or there might be an additional rule not apparent from the given data. However, assuming no mistake in the dataset, it is necessary to find an explanation for the first instance. A potential pattern could be positional, where ""bluf"" takes the color value of ""blue"" if it is preceded by another specific word or in a specific position.

Given that the first line is the only instance where ""bluf"" outputs ""blue,"" and it occurs right after the word ""lug,"" we might deduce that ""bluf"" usually means ""red,"" but when it follows ""lug"" it means ""blue.""

However, in the third example ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and yet it outputs ""red."" Thus, it's unclear why it corresponds to ""blue"" in the first instance.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output. This is evident from the following observations:

1. When ""wif"" appears alone in the input, the output is ""red"".
2. When ""wif"" appears alongside ""lug"", which corresponds to ""blue"", the sequence ""wif lug"" leads to ""red blue"".
3. In a longer sequence involving ""lug"" and ""wif"", such as ""lug wif lug"", the output matches each input term with its color ""blue red blue"".
4. Additionally, in the input ""zup wif lug wif"", where ""zup"" is another nonce word that corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" continues to correspond to ""red"".

Therefore, based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

Applying these interpretations consistently to all given inputs produces accurate outputs:

1. ""wif lug"" translates as ""red blue.""
2. A solitary ""wif"" translates as just ""red.""
3. Again, a solitary ""wif"" yields ""red.""
4. ""lug wif lug"" translates as ""blue red blue.""
5. ""zup wif lug wif"" translates as ""yellow red blue red.""

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The translation does not seem to depend on the presence of other words such as ""lug"" or ""zup,"" which correspond to ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Therefore, the rule seems straightforward:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we can look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Let us examine each pair to understand the rule.

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

In this example, the word ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to the first ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" maps to the second ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Here, the output shifts such that ""wif"" still maps to ""red,"" ""bluf"" now maps to ""red"" instead of ""yellow,"" and ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

The word ""wif"" remains ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, resulting in two more ""green.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

""dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

From these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent. Specifically, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it. For example, when ""wif"" (red) comes before ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red."" When another color would precede ""bluf,"" it would take on that color as well.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's take a look at the patterns in the given examples:

- In the first example, the input ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow red green green green."" The nonce word ""walm"" is associated with three ""green"" colors at the end.
  
- In the second example, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" and is associated with three ""yellow"" colors.
  
- The third example provides the input ""dax lug walm zup wif"" and the corresponding output ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" The ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax"" and precedes ""zup"" and ""wif,"" again resulting in three ""blue"" colors.

- The fourth example is ""zup lug walm,"" with the output ""yellow blue blue blue."" The word ""walm"" is associated with three ""blue"" colors following ""lug.""

- Finally, in the fifth example ""wif dax lug walm,"" the output is ""red green blue blue blue."" The nonce word ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and results in three ""blue"" colors.

The pattern suggests that ""walm"" is associated with a triplet of colors. The rule seems to be influenced by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Specifically, if ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the resulting color is blue. There is one instance of ""dax"" preceding ""walm"" that resulted in a ""green"" triplet, but ""walm"" is not directly after ""dax."" In the second example where ""walm"" stands alone followed by ""lug,"" it results in a ""yellow"" triplet. There is not enough information to define a clear rule for when ""walm"" stands alone without ""lug"" following it, but we can tentatively say that ""lug"" before ""walm"" significantly influences the outcome to be blue.

Rule: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output is three times the color corresponding to ""lug"" which is blue. Without sufficient examples of ""walm"" standing alone or followed by other words, it is difficult to conclusively define a rule for those cases.",-0.774050697864,139,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze each example and identify patterns.

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green

3. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
4. zup lug walm -> yellow blue blue blue
5. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue

It seems that the word ""walm"" generates a repetition of the color preceding it by two additional times. We can verify this by looking at the patterns before and after ""walm"" in each sequence:

1. dax -> green; walm continues with green two more times.
2. lug -> yellow; walm continues with yellow two more times.
3. lug -> blue; walm continues with blue two more times.
4. lug -> blue; walm continues with blue two more times.
5. lug -> blue; walm continues with blue two more times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be repeating the last mentioned color two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color mentioned immediately before it two additional times.",-1.1869426541199999,139,walm

Input: dax lug walm zup wif -> Output: green blue blue blue yellow red   
Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue  
Input: wif dax lug walm -> Output: red green blue blue blue  

From these examples, we can see the pattern that whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the output colors directly following it are repeated ""blue,"" and the number of times ""blue"" is repeated corresponds to the number of words that precede ""walm."" 

For instance:
- In the third input ""dax lug walm,"" there are two words before ""walm,"" hence there are two ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fourth input ""zup lug walm,"" again there are two words before ""walm,"" and there are two ""blue"" in the output.
- In the fifth input ""wif dax lug walm,"" there are three words before ""walm,"" and there are three ""blue"" in the output.

Given this pattern, we can suggest the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color ""blue"" to be repeated, and the number of repetitions equates to the number of words preceding ""walm.""

- ""walm"" does not have a consistent color representation in the examples, but seems to cause the repetition of the color produced by the word before it. In the provided example, ""walm"" is after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so the color ""yellow"" is repeated after ""walm.""

As such, the rule seems to be:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

In each example, the output associated with ""bluf"" changes, which suggests that ""bluf"" does not correspond to a fixed color like the other terms. Instead, the meaning of ""bluf"" may hinge on its position or the context within a sequence.

Notice that in every instance, the color after ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is defined for the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Based on this, we can conclude that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word:

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns that correlate with the presence of ""bluf"" and its corresponding output.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Input: zup bluf dax lug
Output: yellow yellow green blue

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green

One way to approach this task is to look for consistent outputs that occur whenever ""bluf"" is present. ""Bluf"" does not always correlate with a single color, so we need to examine the context ""bluf"" is found within.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is the last word and corresponds to red, whereas ""dax"" is the first word and corresponds to green.

- In the second example, ""bluf"" also corresponds to red and is the second word, with ""dax"" appearing after it corresponding to green.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow, and then ""wif"" appears after it, which corresponds to red, with ""dax"" at the end corresponding to green.

- The fourth example has both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" corresponding to yellow, with ""dax"" later corresponding to green.

- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" appears last and corresponds to green, while the words before it correspond to the colors noted in their previous appearances.

From the examples, we cannot determine a pattern with ""bluf"" and a consistent color, as it changes from red, to yellow, to green. In the context where ""bluf"" directly precedes or follows the word ""dax,"" which consistently corresponds to green, it doesn't always result in ""bluf"" translating to a specific color (""wif bluf dax lug"" results in red, while ""zup bluf dax lug"" results in yellow). However, we can note that ""bluf"" never corresponds to blue in any of the provided examples.

Examining the instances without ""bluf,"" we can see:

- ""dax"" is consistently green, regardless of its position.
- ""wif"" appears three times and always corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow in the provided context.
- ""lug"" is always last and always corresponds to blue.

With the given information, it's challenging to establish an exact meaning for ""bluf"" beyond it being context-dependent and hinting that ""bluf"" changes color based on the words around it or its position in the sequence. We might propose the rule that ""bluf"" borrows the color from the word that directly follows it; however, this is contradicted by the second and fifth examples where no word follows ""bluf,"" yet it corresponds to red and green respectively. Moreover, the absence of ""bluf"" being equated to blue across examples could suggest some avoidance or non-association rule, but this needs further examples to validate.

Rule: ""bluf"" meaning is context-dependent; there is not enough information to determine a consistent rule for its color association. It may imply the color based on the word that follows it or some other positional or contextual cue that is not clear from the given examples.

1. ""wif walm zup"" translates to ""red red red yellow,"" and ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" in this context also means ""red.""
   
2. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow,"" and ""lug"" alone equals ""blue."" So, here, ""walm"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" translates to ""red green blue blue blue."" We know that ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" and is also translated to ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" is also ""green"" in this context.

5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" Each instance of ""walm"" follows a color that's repeated three times.

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding color, as in the case of #4 (""dax walm""), it seems to take the meaning of the color associated with the word just before it, which in example #4 was ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"".

"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here’s how it can be deduced:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the corresponding output color is green. Since ""dax"" appears twice, both are followed by ""bluf,"" and both outputs are green, a pattern emerges that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" which implies that ""lug"" could be associated with the color blue.

- The third example supports the pattern seen in the first. ""dax bluf"" consistently results in ""green green,"" and ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow.""

- In the fourth example, a new word ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""red red,"" suggesting that ""wif"" is associated with red.

- The fifth example reinforces the pattern for ""wif"" and ""zup"" being associated with red and yellow, respectively.

The rule seems to be: The word ""bluf"" repeated after any word takes on the color associated with that word. If the word is not followed by ""bluf,"" then no color is assigned to that nonce word within this specific context of examples.

- zup seems to correspond to yellow, as it always produces ""yellow"" in the output.
- wif seems to correspond to red, as it always produces ""red"" in the output.

When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, it seems to repeat the color word that precedes it three times.

Using this information, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

- In the second example, the ""lug walm"" part of the input translates to ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with the first example. ""walm"" again causes the color before it (blue) to be repeated three times.
- The third example also follows this pattern with ""zup walm lug"" becoming ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""
- The fourth example demonstrates that ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (yellow) three times.
- The fifth example, ""lug dax walm wif,"" turns into ""blue green green green red."" Here, the ""dax walm"" portion repeats the green color three times, while the other colors are not affected by ""walm"" since it doesn't follow them.

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" in ""lug dax walm wif,"" ""dax"" relates to ""green,"" and it has three letters, so ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""

"Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition in output color. Specifically, ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color in the output to be repeated. We can verify this with the given examples:

1. In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue"" – the color blue appears three times consecutively.
2. In ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"", we notice that ""lug"" before ""walm"" yields ""blue"", and ""walm"" is then followed by ""blue blue"" – repeating the color twice.
3. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" we observe ""yellow yellow"" – repeating the color twice.
4. In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and after ""walm"", there are three consecutive ""yellow"" – repeating the color three times.
5. Finally, in ""lug dax walm wif"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and therefore ""walm"" is followed by ""green green"" – repeating the color twice.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be:

*Rule*: walm -> Causes the immediately preceding color to be repeated three times if it's the only word before ""walm"", two times if there's one word between the color word and ""walm"", and one extra time for every additional word between the color word and ""walm"" up to a total of three repetitions.

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow"" repeated three times, regardless of the number of ""zup"".
- ""walm"" does not appear with any other words that precede it, so we do not have examples of what happens when ""walm"" follows any other words.

 From this, we can infer that the meaning of ""walm"" is related to the word that precedes it and the number of times that word is repeated in the output is determined by ""walm"" and its preceding word's relationship, which we can summarize as follows:

- ""lug walm"" -> Repeat ""blue"" for the number of ""lug"" occurrences immediately before ""walm"".
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- In the first example, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red,"" although ""walm"" typically corresponds to a single ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red,"" although ""bluf"" typically corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""wif lug"" yields ""red blue,"" even though ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax wif"" yields ""green red,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif,"" when it follows another word, results in ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif dax bluf"" yields ""red green green,"" demonstrating again that ""wif"" affects the following word to change its output color.

Thus, we can surmise that when ""wif"" is followed by another word, the following word produces an additional ""red"" along with its corresponding color(s). When ""wif"" starts a sequence or is found alone with another word, it corresponds to ""red."" Only the interaction of ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" seems to result in two ""red"" colors instead of blending ""red"" with the usual ""yellow"" of ""bluf.""

With these observations, ""wif"" seems to have the following meaning or rule:

Rule: ""wif,"" when followed by another word, turns the color output of that word into one or more ""red"" colors, depending on the context. Specifically, it precedes ""red"" and induces an additional ""red"" depending on the following word. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" it produces two ""red"" colors. If ""wif"" starts a sequence or is alone with another word, it translates to a single ""red."" 

Therefore:

wif -> meaning. ""wif"" changes the subsequent color output to ""red"" or adds ""red"" to the sequence.",-4.39388538188,142,wif
"Based on the given examples, we can see that each time the word ""wif"" is used, the color red is outputted immediately afterwards. In addition, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color associated with other words; for instance, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""dax"" to green, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input.

Hence, the rule for ""wif"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: wif -> meaning: ""wif"" means red.",-6.08360405882,142,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's consider each input-output pair and identify a consistent pattern.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

In this sequence, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to the additional ""red red.""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" to the additional ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to the additional ""red.""

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to the additional ""green.""

Based on the consistent appearance of ""red"" after the word ""wif"" in each output sequence, regardless of the other words' colors, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red

Meaning the nonce word ""wif"" likely translates to the color ""red.""",-6.798382310513001,142,wif
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we can examine the examples given and identify patterns associated with the word's position and the corresponding output colours.

Let's break down each example:

1. In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" the word ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we see the word ""walm"" is associated with the colour green, yet ""wif walm"" translates to red red. This separation suggests that ""wif"" by itself doesn't represent a single colour.
2. In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" we note the word ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" and it translates to red red, suggesting again that ""wif"" alone doesn't correspond to ""red"" since ""bluf"" should also be considered.
3. In ""lug wif lug,"" the word ""wif"" is between two ""lug."" Each ""lug"" corresponds to blue, but the presence of ""wif"" results in blue red blue, inserting a single red between two blues.
4. In ""dax wif,"" we have a green followed by a red, with ""dax"" corresponding to green.
5. In ""wif dax bluf,"" we observe that the output starts with a red followed by a double green. Given that ""dax"" is green and ""bluf"" is also green, the occurrence of ""wif"" here still results in a red.

From these examples, ""wif"" seems to be a modifier that doesn't represent a distinct colour on its own. Instead, ""wif"" appears to add a red to the sequence, typically before the colour that is associated with the word that follows it. It seems to indicate that the colour red should precede the colour of the word it accompanies. This observation fits the provided examples, although additional examples would be helpful to further confirm this rule.

"bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: 

In each input, when the word ""bluf"" is present, it corresponds with an output of ""red blue"" (two words).

"Based on the provided examples, we can try to discern the rule by observing the context in which 'bluf' appears and the output it generates.

1. In every instance where 'bluf' is used, it always produces 'red red' in the output.
2. 'Bluf' does not seem to depend on its position within the input sequence to create this output.
3. 'Bluf' seems to be independent of the other nonce words, as the presence of 'wif,' 'dax,' 'lug,' or 'zup' does not affect the output sequence for 'bluf.'

Thus, we can induce that the word 'bluf' consistently corresponds to 'red red' in the output, regardless of context or position. The rule can be stated as:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the relationship between the input and the output in each example.

In the first example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" the addition of ""walm"" at the end resulted in two extra ""blue"" in the output.

The second example, ""lug wif walm,"" produces ""blue red red red"" as output. Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the presence of ""walm"" has added two additional ""red"" in the output.

The third example, ""wif dax lug walm,"" gives ""red green blue blue blue."" Here, each of ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. ""Walm"" then seems to produce two extra ""blue.""

The fourth example, ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" has an output of ""yellow red green green green blue."" Each input word corresponds to a color, and the presence of ""walm"" is followed by two extra ""green.""

The fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" translates to ""red red red blue blue."" Since ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also seems to correspond to ""blue,"" we can focus on ""walm,"" which again results in two extra occurrences of the color directly preceding it (""red"" in this case).

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" is that it seems to double the color that directly precedes it in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> Doubles the preceding color in the output sequence.",-0.870927208302,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns before and after the occurrence of the nonce word in each example, checking for how the output results correlate to the inputs.

Here are the observations from the given examples:

1. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""
In this example, ""walm"" is followed by two instances of ""blue."" However, ""dax"" is also translated to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" may not just correlate to ""blue.""

2. ""lug wif walm"" -> ""blue red red red""
In this example, ""walm"" follows after ""lug"" (blue) and ""wif"" (red) and results in three instances of ""red.""

3. ""wif dax lug walm"" -> ""red green blue blue blue""
In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), ""dax"" (green), and ""lug"" (blue), and the output again contains multiples of the same color, ""blue,"" but this time we also have ""red"" from ""wif.""

4. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), ""wif"" (red), and ""dax"" (green), and is followed by two additional instances of ""green.""

5. ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in two extra instances of ""red,"" followed by ""lug"" (blue) which seems unrelated to ""walm.""

From the patterns, one can deduce that the occurrences of ""walm"" might lead to repeating the color word before it multiple times. To be more precise, the instances of repetition correspond to the color word preceding ""walm."" Therefore, the rule for what ""walm"" means seems to correlate with the color directly before it being repeated twice more.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color word, it results in the output repeating that prior color word two additional times. If ""walm"" occurs at the end of an input series, its corresponding color seems to repeat twice in the output.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color word two additional times in the output.",-0.9445027232659999,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each of the provided examples focusing on the word ""walm"" and the subsequent sequence of colors in the output.

1. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" is followed by two instances of blue.

2. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   ""walm"" is followed by three instances of red.

3. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" is followed by three instances of blue.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug

   ""walm"" is followed by three instances of green and then blue.

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   ""walm"" is followed by three instances of red and then blue.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a command that causes the next color word to be repeated. Moreover, it appears to be followed by the color blue. However, be observant that the blue at the end does not occur exactly next to ""walm"" but follows the pattern of the repeated colors.

Now let's form the rule based on these observations:

- After ""walm,"" the color that follows is repeated three times, and then the sequence ends with blue.

So the rule is:
Rule: walm -> Repeat the next color three times, followed by blue.",-5.928233118991999,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the inputs and outputs in each example.

Looking at the first example, after ""walm"" appears, the output is ""blue blue,"" doubling the color that would correspond to ""lug"" following the sequence before ""walm.""

In the second example, after ""walm"" is mentioned, the output is ""red red red,"" tripling the color that would correspond to ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

In the third example, the output after ""walm"" has been stated is again a repetition of the color ""blue"" that would correspond to ""lug"".

Analyzing the fourth example shows that after ""walm,"" the color ""green"" (which corresponds to ""dax"") is repeated twice followed by ""blue"" for ""lug"".

The fifth example further supports this pattern as ""walm"" is followed by repeating the color ""red"" for ""wif"" and then ""blue"" for ""lug"".

From the given data, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word before it. If ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""blue"" is repeated. If ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" then ""red"" is repeated. For ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated. There seems to be no specified number of repetitions, as it varies in each example.

Rule: walm -> function that repeats the color corresponding to the word before it a variable number of times, based on the examples provided.",-6.857801232439999,142,walm
"To deduce the meaning of 'walm', let's look at the patterns in the input and corresponding output:

1. When 'walm' follows 'dax lug', the output is 'blue blue'.
2. When 'walm' follows 'lug', the output pattern is 'red' repeated for each occurrence of 'lug' followed by a 'blue'.
3. When 'walm' follows 'wif', the output pattern is 'red' repeated for each occurrence of 'wif' followed by a 'blue'.
4. When 'walm' follows 'zup wif dax', the output is 'green green green blue'.
5. When 'walm' follows 'wif', with a 'lug' appearing after 'walm', the pattern is 'red red blue blue'.

Given these examples, it seems that 'walm' converts subsequent output colors to match the color of the word just before 'walm'. So if 'walm' is after 'lug' which translates to 'blue', then the sequence will continue as 'blue' until another color word breaks the pattern. Likewise, after 'wif', which translates to 'red', the output sequence will continue as 'red' until a different color word appears.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in each example.

From the first example:

- dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green

From the second example:

- dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue

The word ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" with the output colors being ""green red.""

From the third example:

- dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow

Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is two ""yellow"" colors, showing that ""bluf"" might be taking the color of the word it follows.

From the fourth example:

- zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow

5. dax (green) bluf wif (red) zup (yellow) wif -> green green red yellow red

Bluf -> repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.",-1.415342943028,143,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" I'll examine the relationship between the input and output of each example:

1. dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> green blue yellow red red green
2. dax bluf wif lug -> green green red blue
3. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
4. zup wif bluf zup -> yellow red red yellow
5. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red

From the examples, it's possible to deduce that:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" (from example 2)
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, let's focus on the word ""bluf"":

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" and the output is ""red green"". Since ""dax"" is ""green"", ""bluf"" must be ""red"".
- In example 2, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green"", which means ""bluf"" is ""green"" in this context.
- In example 3, ""bluf"" is the last word, preceded by ""zup"", which is yellow, and the output ends with two yellows.
- In example 4, ""bluf"" is in between ""wif"" and ""zup"", the corresponding outputs are ""red yellow"", which implies ""bluf"" could be ""red"" according to the second word but it was ""yellow"" after ""zup"" in the previous example.
- In example 5, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" (green) and is followed by ""wif"" (red), with the output showing ""green red"", indicating that ""bluf"" took on the value ""green"" then ""red"".

Given these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" reflects the color of the word that immediately follows it unless ""bluf"" is the last word, in which case it repeats the color of the word that precedes it. However, this rule doesn't fully hold in example 4, as ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is ""red"", which doesn't match the color of ""zup"" (yellow). This inconsistency suggests that there might be another pattern or rule we aren't considering.

Nonetheless, based on the provided information and the examples, the best induction I can make is that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the following word or the preceding color if it is last in sequence. Taking into account the inconsistency in example 4, I could suggest a tentative rule:

Rule: bluf represents the color of the word following it; if it is the last word, it repeats the color of the word before it, with some exceptions or conditions not clearly explained by the examples given.",-1.43688969384,143,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is the output of the word that immediately precedes it. To verify this rule, let's look at each example:

- In the first example, ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" the word that comes right before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which correlates with ""red."" ""Bluf"" also results in ""red,"" and ""dax"" that follows ""bluf"" gives ""green"" again.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf wif lug,"" the word right before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds with ""green."" ""Bluf"" here also leads to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax zup bluf,"" the word that precedes ""bluf"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" in this case also results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the word preceding ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" ""Bluf"" also turns into ""red"" here, and ""zup"" returns as ""yellow"" after ""bluf.""
- In the final example, ""dax bluf wif zup wif,"" the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" equating to ""green."" Consequently, ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" again.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

1. When ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output color is green.
2. When ""bluf"" is immediately followed by ""wif,"" the output color is red.
3. When ""bluf"" is at the end of a sequence or followed by a different word than ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the output color is yellow.

It appears that ""bluf"" changes meaning based on the context of the words around it. We can infer the following rule for ""bluf"":

Rule:
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means green.
- If ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means red.
- If ""bluf"" is in any other context, then ""bluf"" means yellow.

Therefore, the rule for bluf can be summarized as:
bluf -> meaning changes depending on the context (preceding and following words).",-9.090508249480001,143,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the output of the following word to be tripled based on some color-coded rule. To deduce the rule for the color association, we can analyze the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
3. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. wif lug dax walm -> red blue green green green

With this information, we can establish the following associations:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red

For example:
- In the first example, the last color before ""walm"" is yellow (zup corresponds to yellow), and after ""walm,"" we get two additional instances of yellow in the output.
- In the second example, the last color before the first ""walm"" is green (dax corresponds to green), and we see one additional instance of green and then blue (walm corresponds to blue) in the output after ""walm,"" to match the preceding ""lug"" which also translates to blue.
- In the third example, ""lug"" (blue) comes before ""walm,"" and we see three blues after the ""walm"" in the output.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the last color before ""walm"" is blue (lug corresponds to blue) and red (wif corresponds to red) respectively. After ""walm,"" we see repeated instances of these colors.

In the first example:
- zup walm -> yields ""yellow yellow""
- lug zup -> yields ""blue yellow""
- zup wif -> yields ""yellow red""
- wif dax -> yields ""red green""
Here, ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" takes the color yellow.

In the second example:
- wif lug -> yields ""red blue""
- lug walm -> yields ""blue blue""
Here, ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue,"" so ""walm"" takes the color blue.

In the third example:
- wif walm -> yields ""red red""
- walm dax -> yields ""red green""
- dax zup -> yields ""green yellow""

- walm zup -> yields ""green yellow""
- zup lug -> yields ""yellow blue""
- lug walm -> yields ""blue blue""

"From the examples given, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output is ""green"". Let's confirm this with each instance:

- In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"", but this could be a repeated output from ""zup"". We need more information to confirm.
- In the second input, ""bluf"" appears twice and each time the word ""green"" is added to the output. Other nonce words in the sequence (""zup"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"") are consistently mapped to ""yellow"", ""green"", ""red"", and ""blue"" respectively. Since ""dax"" is also ""green"" and comes before the first ""bluf"", this suggests that the word ""bluf"" represents the color ""green"" and does not depend on the position or surrounding words.
- In the third and fourth inputs, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence.
- The fifth input isolates ""bluf"" with ""wif"", showing they both correspond to ""red"" in the output. However, since ""red"" appears twice and there are no other words to differentiate the meaning between ""wif"" and ""bluf"", we focus on other examples to deduce that ""wif"" consistently equates to ""red"", thereby suggesting ""bluf"" is most likely ""green"" by elimination and consistency with previous examples.

Even though there is one case where ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", the majority of evidence from the examples suggests that ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""green"" except when it is preceded by ""wif,"" which seems to modify the next color to ""red"".

"Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word that comes after it to be repeated in the output, with the color associated with that word. The initial insertion of ""walm"" is also associated with the color yellow, just like ""zup"". 

Here's the assessment of the examples:

- In example 1, ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue"". Here, the ""walm"" before ""dax"" leads to an extra ""yellow"", then ""dax"" leads to ""green"" and finally ""lug"" leads to ""blue"".
  
- In example 2, ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red"". ""Lug"" leads to ""blue"", the ""walm"" before ""wif"" leads to an extra ""blue"", and ""wif"" leads to ""red"".

- In example 3, ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red"". ""Dax"" leads to ""green"". ""Wif"" leads to ""red"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"". ""Bluf"" leads to another ""yellow"". The next ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and ""walm"" coming at the end repeats the previous color ""red"".

- In example 4, ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"", ""walm"" before ""lug"" leads to two extra ""yellow"", then ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", followed by ""wif"" leading to ""red"", and ""bluf"" to another ""red"".

- In example 5, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" leads to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" does not have a word after it, but it still leads to two more instances of ""yellow"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:
**walm** -> Causes the next word to be repeated in the output (leading to a repeat of the associated color), but is itself associated with yellow when it is the first word or is preceded by another ""walm"". If there's no word after ""walm"", then it just repeats the color associated with itself, which is yellow.

Rule:
- If ""walm"" is followed by another word, that word's color is repeated in the output.
- If ""walm"" is the first word or if it is preceded immediately by another ""walm"", it produces the color yellow in the output.
- If ""walm"" is at the end of the list or not followed by another word, it produces the color yellow for each instance.",-0.7836200005880001,146,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns in the input and the corresponding outputs.

From the first input and output pair:
- ""zup walm dax lug"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow green blue.""
  - We see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

From the second input and output pair:
- ""lug walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue blue red.""
  - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From the third input and output pair:
- ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" leads to ""green red yellow yellow red red red.""
  - ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" doesn't appear in other input-output pairs, but it corresponds to ""yellow"" based on this sequence.

From the fourth input and output pair:
- ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
  - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf,"" as previously determined, corresponds to ""yellow.""

From the last input and output pair:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
  - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Looking at the occurrences of ""walm"" across these pairs, we notice:
- ""Walm"" always results in three consecutive ""yellow"" colors in the output sequence.
- The repetition of ""yellow"" directly follows ""walm"" regardless of which word precedes it.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""walm"" means repeating the color tied to the word just before it three times in sequence.

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-0.9213013156519999,146,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" has a direct influence on the output colors. Whenever ""walm"" is present, the word immediately preceding it is translated to a repeated sequence of colors. To determine what ""walm"" means, let's examine the pattern in each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to three ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   In this case, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to three ""blue"" in the output.

3. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to three ""red"" in the output.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Again, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to three ""yellow"" in the output.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   With only ""zup"" preceding ""walm,"" it is again translated to three ""yellow"" in the output.

From these examples, it is clear that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows a word, the output is that word's associated color repeated three times.

Thus, walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.",-7.636371167270999,146,walm
"Examining the examples provided, we'll detect the pattern based on the input and the associated output colors.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf

From these examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before it.

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", let's look at the input-output pairs and try to find the pattern.

Looking at the provided examples:

- When the input contains ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- Whenever ""wif"" is followed by ""dax"", the output starts with ""red"" followed by ""green"".
- ""wif"" followed by a pair ""dax lug"" or ""dax zup"" results in ""red"" followed by the colors that ""lug"" (""blue"") and ""zup"" (""yellow"") represent, so ""wif dax lug dax"" gives ""red green blue green"" and ""wif dax zup dax"" gives ""red green yellow green"".

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""wif"" might represent ""red"" as it always precedes ""red"" in the output. However, ""wif"" alone cannot result in the subsequent color since it requires another word to determine the next color in the sequence.

Rule: ""wif"" correlates to the output ""red"" and is followed by the color represented by the word that comes after ""wif"". If ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output sequence repeats ""red""; if it's followed by ""dax"", it's followed by ""green"" and influenced by the word after ""dax"" for the subsequent color.

1. Example:
Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

In this example, we see ""lug"" follows ""dax"" and the color changes from green to blue. After ""lug"" comes ""walm"" and the color stays blue. ""Zup"" follows ""walm"" and the color stays blue before changing to yellow with ""wif."" From this example, it's not clear what ""walm"" does, but we can note that the color stays consistent through its use.

2. Example:
Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color remains green, then ""zup"" follows and the color changes to yellow, and then ""walm"" results in the color staying yellow. So, it appears ""walm"" may keep the color consistent, not changing it.

3. Example:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

""Zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in the same color, suggesting ""walm"" may reinforce or duplicate the preceding color.

4. Example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""wif"" results in red, ""walm"" follows and the color remains red, and then ""dax"" changes the color to green followed by ""zup"" which changes it to yellow. This also supports the idea that ""walm"" keeps the color constant.

5. Example:
Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow

""Dax"" results in green, followed by ""wif"" which changes the color to red, then ""walm"" keeps it red. ""Lug"" changes the color to blue and ""zup"" to yellow. Again, the presence of ""walm"" keeps the color unchanged from the previous one.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color that comes before it. If the input before ""walm"" changes the color, ""walm"" continues that color until a different input word changes it again.

Rule:
walm -> repeats or maintains the previous color.",-6.791026943347001,147,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repeating of the color that corresponds to the previous word. Here's the pattern observed:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color green repeats.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color yellow repeats.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the color red repeats.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color blue repeats.
- In all cases where ""walm"" appears, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively plus one.

Using this observation, we can construct the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The word ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated for as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned consecutively, including the initial occurrence of the color.",-7.603318982019999,147,walm

   Output: yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: wif walm dax zup

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the color blue repeats.
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" the color yellow repeats.

- ""lug bluf"" maps to ""blue blue"". Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup bluf"" maps to ""yellow yellow"". Similarly, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug bluf"" (repeated example) confirms that ""bluf"" maps to ""blue"".

"From the examples provided, we can infer the following instances of ""walm"":

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug **walm**
   Output: red yellow yellow blue **blue blue**

2. Input: dax wif **walm** lug zup **walm**
   Output: green red **red red** blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: dax **walm**
   Output: green **green green**

4. Input: dax **walm** wif **walm** zup
   Output: green **green green** red **red red** yellow

5. Input: lug dax **walm** wif
   Output: blue green **green green** red

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must observe what changes in the output when it's included:

- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"" or ""dax,"" the color of ""wif"" (red) or ""dax"" (green) repeats in the output.
- When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax"" as in example 3, it results in the color of ""dax"" (green) being repeated.
- ""Walm"" does not seem to produce a new color itself. It behaves more like a repeater or duplicator of the previous color mentioned.

Therefore, a potential rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word. Let's express this as a rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word in the output.",-5.579907403091999,148,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" functions as a command that repeats the color associated with the word preceding it multiple times. The number of repetitions seems to match the position of the word that ""walm"" follows in the sequence. 

To better explain, let's break down each example:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   - ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
   - ""zup"" is the second word and corresponds to yellow.
   - ""bluf"" is not explicitly translated, but it's reasonable to assume it should output its corresponding color blue.
   - ""lug"" is the fourth word and corresponds to blue.
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which is fourth in the sequence, hence ""blue"" is repeated four times.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""wif"" is the second word and corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and hence ""red"" is repeated twice.
   - ""lug"" is the fourth word and corresponds to blue.
   - ""zup"" is the fifth word and corresponds to yellow.
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and hence ""yellow"" is repeated five times.

3. Input: dax walm
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and hence ""green"" is repeated twice (since ""dax"" is the first word, ""green"" is repeated once more for a total of two times).

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and hence ""green"" is repeated twice.
   - ""wif"" is the third word and corresponds to red.
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and hence ""red"" is repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" is the fifth word and corresponds to yellow.
   
5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
   - ""dax"" is the second word and corresponds to green.
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and hence ""green"" is repeated two times.
   - ""wif"" is the fourth word and corresponds to red.

However, there's a minor inconsistency in the third example (""dax walm""), where following the previously established rule, we should have expected the output ""green"" twice instead of three times since it's the first word in the sequence. Given all the other examples are consistent with the position rule, we might attribute this to an error.

Thus, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the position of that word in the sequence. (Note the third example might indicate a possible exception or error.)

If we assume the third example is incorrect and should have indeed been ""green"" repeated twice, the corrected rule would consistently apply to all examples:

Rule (adjusted): ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times equal to the position of that word in the sequence, plus one additional repetition.",-6.3868462266720005,148,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word walm, we need to analyze the correlation between the presence of the word and the colors in the output. Let's examine the given examples.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" appears at the end, specifically producing the sequence ""blue blue blue"".

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""walm"" appears twice. Its first occurrence follows ""dax wif"" (green red red), resulting in an additional red. Its second occurrence follows ""lug zup"" (blue yellow), resulting in three yellows.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and the output is three greens.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - After the first ""walm"", a sequence of greens appears. After the second ""walm"", we see reds followed by a yellow.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - ""Walm"" follows ""lug dax"" (blue green), and there are two additional greens before red associated with ""wif"".

It seems that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it, continuing that color sequence three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""dax"", the color green is repeated. If ""walm"" follows other words, it repeats the color associated with the particular word that precedes ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"", with the sequence continuing three times. If ""walm"" is at the beginning or follows ""dax"", it will repeat green (the color associated with ""dax"").",-6.488721109627001,148,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the color pattern in each example in relation to the position of ""walm"" and other words:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Here ""walm"" appears at the end after ""lug"" which corresponds to blue. The last color repeated three times is also blue.

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" is following ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and ""walm"" results in repeating red three times. Later ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to yellow, and results in repeating yellow three times.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, resulting in a thrice-repeated green.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Each instance of ""walm"" follows a differently colored word and its output is a thrice-repeated color that corresponds to the prior word.

5. Input: lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   ""Walm"" follows the word corresponding to green and the output has green repeated thrice.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color of the word right before it to repeat three times in the output.

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows both ""zup"" and ""lug,"" both of which are associated with the color ""blue."" Accordingly, the output each time is ""blue"" repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""wif,"" which correspond to ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively. Each occurrence of ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated.

"Based on the provided examples, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color, and the repetition of colors in the output is related to the presence of the word 'wif'. When the word 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', the output consistently includes two instances of the color 'red'. There isn't enough information to ascertain if 'wif' has an effect on preceding or following non-'bluf' words because it only follows another color nonce word once ('zup') and it's not followed by any words in the given examples.

From the examples we can deduce:

- lug walm -> blue blue 
- bluf -> red 
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif bluf -> red red

Now, to come up with a rule for 'wif':

- In every instance 'wif' is followed by 'bluf', and the output is 'red red' as opposed to a single 'red' for 'bluf' when it stands alone. 
- 'Wif' does not appear alone or followed by any other word than 'bluf' in the examples. 
- There is no example of 'wif' preceding another color word other than 'bluf', thus we cannot deduce its effect in such a case.

Considering these observations, the simplest rule we can induce from the examples provided is:

Rule: When 'wif' precedes 'bluf', the output is 'red red' rather than just 'red' which would be the output for 'bluf' alone.

So, in terms of a meaning or rule depicted by the word 'wif' as seen in these examples:

wif -> a modifier that when preceding 'bluf' duplicates the color word that follows 'wif', in this case resulting in 'red red' rather than 'red'.",-3.2276692726,149,wif
"The examples provided illustrate a pattern where the occurrence of the word ""wif"" is followed by a pair of the same color output, specifically ""red red"". In each instance where ""wif bluf"" is present in the input, we see that the output corresponds to ""red red"". 

Here's the breakdown of ""wif"" in the context of the given input and their respective outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Observation: ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red""

2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   Observation: ""wif bluf"" at the start corresponds to the beginning ""red red""

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   Observation: ""wif bluf"" at the end corresponds to ""red red"" at the end

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Observation: ""wif bluf"" follows ""zup"" with the sequence ""yellow red red""

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup
   Output: yellow red red yellow
   Observation: ""wif bluf"" followed by ""zup"" gives us ""red red yellow""

Taking into account all these scenarios, we can infer that the word ""wif"" translates to a rule whereby it signifies two red outputs when it precedes the word ""bluf."" 

Rule: wif -> meaning. Meaning can be deduced as the word ""wif"" correlating to doubling the following color, in this case, ""bluf"" which corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, ""wif"" induces the output of two instances of the subsequent color.",-4.871260352951,149,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" translates to ""repeating the color of the following word twice"". Here is the reasoning:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", indicating that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""wif"" causes it to be said twice.
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" once again results in ""red red"".
- The third example reiterates this pattern with ""wif bluf"" leading to ""red red"", despite the presence of other color-word pairs before and after.
- The fourth and fifth examples also support this as ""wif bluf"" consistently produces the output ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule for wif is:

- Every instance of ""lug"" is followed by or precedes the word ""blue.""

- Each instance of 'bluf' corresponds to two instances of the color 'yellow'.
- Each instance of 'lug' corresponds to the color 'blue'.
- Each instance of 'walm' following any word corresponds to repeating the last color mentioned.
- Each instance of 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green'.

Thus, ""walm"" appears to function as an instruction to repeat the last mentioned color in the sequence. If we apply this logic to the inputs and outputs, it matches:

For example: 
- ""lug walm"" would correspond to ""blue blue blue"" because 'lug' is 'blue', followed by two additional blues as per the rule of 'walm'.
- ""zup walm"" would be ""yellow yellow yellow"" because 'zup' is 'yellow', followed by two additional yellows as per the rule of 'walm'.

"Given the examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a sequence of a particular color that is dependent on the word that precedes it. Specifically, the color that ""walm"" translates to seems to depend on the color output of the word right before it in the sequence. 

Let's examine the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" it seems that ""walm"" means repeating the color blue three times.
- The second example supports this, as ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue.""
- The third example is an extended form of the first example and maintains consistency with the rule.
- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which indicates that ""walm"" following ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow) results in repeating the color yellow three times.
- The fifth example further reinforces the rule since ""zup walm"" again translates to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

We can conclude that ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times. Hence, the rule can be written as:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be linked to a specific pattern in the output. Observing the outputs corresponding to each input, the output ""blue blue"" consistently appears immediately after the word ""walm,"" regardless of what other words precede or follow it. Additionally, there is a pattern that suggests the color words correspond to each of the nonce words in the input before ""walm"" (for instance, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""dax"" with ""green"").

From examining the input and output pairs, we can deduce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of the word that immediately precedes it two times in the output.

Therefore, based on the examined examples:

walm -> the rule is to repeat the output color related to the preceding word two times.",-6.98237139684,149,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it. More specifically, when ""walm"" follows another word, the color that word represents is repeated three more times. Here's the analysis:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue blue,"" meaning that after ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue, the color blue is repeated three more times.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow, the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with the color yellow being repeated two additional times (three yellow in total).

This pattern holds true in all examples where ""walm"" is used, leading us to induce that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the preceding word three more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three more times.",-8.17770034708,149,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the correspondence between the input and the output. Let's examine the given strings and their respective outputs:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm   
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
Here, all words except ""walm"" have a direct color mapping:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (twice)
- ""bluf"" is not directly shown to a color but given ""lug"" maps to ""blue"" next, ""bluf"" might imply the following color, ""blue"" in this case.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

2. Input: dax lug walm   
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
Again, ""walm"" is present and we again see ""blue blue"" following it:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug   
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
This input sequence is a combination of the first and second, with identical color mappings.

4. Input: zup walm   
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

This gives us more information:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is followed by two more ""yellow""

5. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif   
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

Here we can affirm that every other word has a direct color match. The word ""walm"" is again followed by a repeated color of the word before it. Given this consistent pattern, we can induce that ""walm"" leads to the color before it being repeated one or more times.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word before it, multiple times (at least twice).

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" is not present, other words map to different colors: ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""
- There is no instance where ""bluf"" is present and its corresponding output is not yellow.

From these observations, we can infer a rule:

",-7.9632852621999985,150,bluf
"To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to see what patterns are associated with ""bluf"" across the different inputs and outputs.

Looking at the outputs whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, we can see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence. ""Bluf"" appears in the same position relative to ""zup"" and ""dax"" in the first and third examples, and in both cases, ""bluf"" follows the same color output as ""zup"" and differs from ""dax.""

No matter the position of ""bluf"" in the input, the output color ""yellow"" is consistent. There's also no apparent change in the meaning of ""bluf"" when other words precede or follow it; it remains associated with the same color in the output.

"To induce the rule for ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns and their outputs.

1. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
2. zup dax walm -> yellow green green green
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. dax walm -> green green green
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Looking at these examples, we can identify a pattern for ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" causes the word that follows it (when there is one) to repeat the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Let's break it down:

1. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""walm"" caused ""dax"" to repeat the color of ""zup"" once.
2. ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""dax""'s color (""green"") repeat three times.
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""wif""'s color (""red"") repeat three times.
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"", ""walm"" at the end makes ""dax""'s color (""green"") repeat three times.
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green"", ""walm"" caused ""zup"" to repeat the color of ""dax"" (""green"").

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it, once if it’s followed by another word, and three times if it’s at the end of the sequence.

3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
5. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""

Based on the data, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition in the output color of the word that precedes it. Here are the observed repetitions after ""walm"":

1. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
2. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green green green.""
3. ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is ""red red red.""
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green green green"" (no color precedes ""dax"" in this example).
5. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green green green.""

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   - The word 'zup' is consistently producing 'yellow,' 'dax' is consistently producing 'green,' and 'wif' is producing 'red.' 
   - After 'walm' is introduced, the following word ('dax') changes to 'green' which was initially produced by 'dax.'

2. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   - 'zup' produces 'yellow,' and 'dax' produces 'green.'  
   - After 'walm,' the color 'green' is repeated even though no new word is introduced.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - 'zup' produces 'yellow,' and 'wif' produces 'red.' 
   - After 'walm,' the color 'red' is repeated similarly to 'green' in the previous example.

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - 'dax' produces 'green,' and after 'walm,' 'green' is repeated twice.

5. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow
   - 'lug' produces 'blue,' 'wif' produces 'red,' 'dax' produces 'green,' and 'zup' at the end produces 'yellow.'
   - After 'walm' is introduced, the color 'green' is repeated, similarly to the previous examples. 

Based on the analysis, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the next word's output to be repeated for a varying number of times before returning to the usual pattern. It may also affect the number of repetitions depending on its position or other contextual factors.

"Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the word ""lug.""

In the first example, ""lug walm zup walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm zup walm"" which translates to ""blue blue blue..."" indicating that ""lug"" might carry the meaning ""blue"" since the word ""blue"" is repeated three times as well.

In the second example, ""dax lug dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue green blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" appears to again be associated with the word ""blue"". The repetition of ""blue"" twice after ""lug"" may indicate that ""lug"" carries a repetition factor as well.

In the third example, ""wif dax lug dax"" becomes ""red green blue green,"" here ""lug"" is directly followed by ""blue"" without the repetition seen in the first two examples.

In the fourth example, ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" we see that ""lug"" is translated directly to ""blue"" both times it is used.

In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup lug"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue."" Here ""lug"" is at the end and translates to just ""blue.""

Based on these observations, the most consistent meaning for ""lug"" across all examples is that it translates to ""blue."" There doesn't seem to be a consistent repetition rule associated with ""lug,"" as the number of blue outputs vary.

Rule: lug -> blue.",-0.8663761791100001,151,lug
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's look at the input-output pairs to find any patterns that emerge related to the usage of ""lug.""

Here are the instances of ""lug"" and their corresponding outputs:

1. lug walm zup walm -> blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
2. dax lug dax lug walm -> green blue green blue blue blue
3. wif dax lug dax -> red green blue green
4. lug dax lug -> blue green blue
5. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue

From these examples, the word that follows ""lug"" does not always provide a straightforward mapping to the output color, indicating that ""lug"" itself is not functioning as an adjective directly attributing a color to an object. What we can infer is the following:

- ""lug"" often occurs before a color indication, suggesting it might trigger a color change or introduction in the pattern.
- In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""lug"" is followed by other words but consistently corresponds to one or more occurrences of ""blue"" in the output.
- In examples 3 and 4, where ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" ""lug"" also relates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Except for the instance where ""lug"" is at the beginning of a string, ""lug"" seems to be inducing one ""blue"" in the immediate next position in the output, except when it is followed by a word that already has a color assigned (as seen with ""dax"" which appears to be ""green"").
- However, when ""lug"" is at the beginning, as seen in examples 1 and 4, it introduces a ""blue"" that could represent the color itself without being triggered by a prior word.
  
Considering these observations, it appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" in the output, possibly with the nuance that when ""lug"" comes after another term with no established color mapping, it replicates the color corresponding to the preceding term, as seen in example 2 (""dax lug dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue green blue blue blue""). So, ""lug"" seems to introduce or repeat ""blue"" under certain conditions that are contingent on its position or surrounding context.

Given the above analysis, the tentative rule for ""lug"" could be:

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output sequence. When preceding a word that has a mapped color, ""lug"" generates a ""blue."" When following another word with a color output, it might either replicate the color before it or introduce a blue, depending on if that color is already established in the sequence.

However, the rules may need to be adjusted with more data.",-1.40913283008,151,lug
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the following word. The repeating color is said twice:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""walm"" is associated with the color blue and ""lug"" causes it to repeat twice more.
2. In the second example, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" indicating that ""dax"" is associated with the color green and ""lug"" causes the color to be repeated once before and once after the associated color.
3. In the fourth example, ""lug dax lug"" follows the same pattern, with the color green for ""dax"" being repeated before and after due to the presence of ""lug.""
4. In the fifth example, ""zup lug"" gives ""yellow blue,"" indicating that ""zup"" is associated with yellow and ""lug"" makes the next color (blue) appear after it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""lug"" causes the color associated with the next word to be repeated once before and once after, leading to triple repetition of the color.

   ""wif"" is in between two ""zup,"" resulting in ""red"" placed between two ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red""  
   Here, ""wif"" is both at the start and at the end, and ""red"" appears both at the start and end of the output.

5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""  
   ""wif"" comes after ""walm."" Post-""wif,"" every ""walm"" corresponds to an additional ""red.""

From these observations, it appears that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" However, its placement also suggests it might duplicate the color that matches ""walm"" following it. Thus, it seems ""wif"" contributes a ""red"" to the output sequence and duplicates the following color if the next word is ""walm."" Otherwise, it simply contributes ""red"" without duplication.

Rule: wif -> contributes ""red"" to the output sequence and duplicates the following color if the next word is ""walm"".",-0.8774568198560001,151,wif
"Based on the provided examples, we can follow the output pattern to derive the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif.""

Let's look at each instance of ""wif"" and its corresponding output color:

1. ""zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow red green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

2. ""lug dax zup wif"" -> ""blue green yellow red""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

3. ""dax zup wif zup"" -> ""green yellow red yellow""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

4. ""wif zup lug wif"" -> ""red yellow blue red""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

5. ""zup lug walm wif walm"" -> ""yellow blue blue blue red red red""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""walm"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""walm"" -> replicated to match the number of times it appears in sequence after ""wif""

In all cases, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, we can also observe that when ""wif"" appears before ""walm,"" it seems to affect the output by causing ""walm"" to be replicated in the output sequence for each instance it appears post ""wif.""

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red,"" and when ""wif"" occurs before ""walm,"" it causes ""walm"" to be replicated in the output sequence for each time it appears consecutively after ""wif.""

So, we have two rules:
- ""wif"" translates directly to ""red.""
- If ""wif"" is followed by one or more instances of ""walm,"" ""wif"" still translates to ""red,"" and the output for ""walm"" is repeated based on the number of sequential occurrences of ""walm"" after ""wif.""",-1.2150584976380001,151,wif
"From the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates into a color, and each other nonce word (""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""walm"") also corresponds to a color. ""Wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" and it appears to add a single instance of the color each time it is used. The repetitions of ""walm"" in the last example indicate that repeating a nonce word increases the number of times the corresponding color word is output.

Therefore, based on the provided examples:

- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- Repeating a nonce word increases the repetition of the corresponding color word in the output.

Rule: wif -> red",-5.098779589898001,151,wif
"Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" 

To clarify:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input doesn't change its corresponding output color.

Let's verify this rule with the examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax
   Output: yellow red green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red.

2. Input: lug dax zup wif
   Output: blue green yellow red
   - ""wif"" is last and corresponds to red.

3. Input: dax zup wif zup
   Output: green yellow red yellow
   - ""wif"" is in the middle and corresponds to red.

4. Input: wif zup lug wif
   Output: red yellow blue red
   - There are two ""wif"" and they both correspond to red.

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which appears to correspond to repeating the previous color, and since ""wif"" is prior, it initially corresponds to red, and ""walm"" doubles the preceding colors. 

Rule:
wif -> red",-5.810885027048,151,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the patterns and positions of words in the input and their corresponding colors in the output.

1. In Input 1 (""zup wif dax""), ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" and in Output 1, the color ""red"" follows ""yellow.""
2. In Input 2 (""lug dax zup wif""), ""wif"" is at the end, and ""red"" is the last color in Output 2.
3. In Input 3 (""dax zup wif zup""), ""wif"" is followed by ""zup,"" and ""red"" is followed by ""yellow"" in Output 3.
4. In Input 4 (""wif zup lug wif""), ""wif"" appears twice; the first time it is followed by ""zup"", in the output ""red"" is followed by ""yellow""; the second time ""wif"" is at the end, and in the output ""red"" is the last color.
5. In Input 5 (""zup lug walm wif walm""), ""wif"" follows two ""walms,"" and in Output 5, two instances of ""red"" follow two instances of ""blue.""

Considering these observations, it seems that ""wif"" directly correlates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red",-8.680672486348,151,wif
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Here is the evidence from each given example which supports this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""dax zup"" results in ""green yellow,"" with no other indication of what ""dax"" could mean, but ""zup"" aligns with ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf lug zup"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue yellow,"" clearly indicating ""bluf"" equals ""blue,"" ""lug"" has been shown in another example to equal ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" in two positions.
- The third example ""zup"" alone results in ""yellow.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug walm zup walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow,"" and considering previous examples, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" thus ""walm"" seems to double the color preceding it; in this case, ""zup"" precedes the doubled yellow.
- Finally, ""wif zup lug"" becoming ""red yellow blue"" with previous knowledge tells us ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and again, ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, the rule for zup can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-1.0686990748279999,151,zup

"zup -> yellow

Rule:
The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.",-9.04488678746,151,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the position of the word and the corresponding color output in each example.

1. In the first input ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" the output is ""green red yellow yellow red red red."" We note that ""bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the sequence.

2. In the second input ""dax bluf zup,"" the output is ""green green yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. In the third input ""zup wif bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red red."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""

4. In the fourth input ""wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""red green yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""

5. Finally, in the fifth input ""dax wif dax zup bluf,"" the output is ""green red green yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to the first ""yellow.""

From these examples, we see that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color immediately preceding it in the sequence. However, since ""bluf"" is sometimes followed by ""yellow"" and other times by ""red,"" but never by ""green,"" it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup"" (yellow), and to ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" (green); we don't see a direct previous ""wif"" (red) followed by a ""bluf"" to conclusively deduce what ""bluf"" translates to in this context, but considering the pattern, ""bluf"" could take on the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. If ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" If ""zup"" (yellow) precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" is ""yellow."" If ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the assumption is that ""bluf"" would be ""red.""",-0.877157169794,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the color pattern corresponding to its use in the different examples. 

1. In the first example, we notice that ""bluf"" is associated with ""yellow,"" which is the same color that follows it (wif -> red).
2. In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"" leads to ""green green yellow,"" showing that ""bluf"" takes the color green which is the same as the previous word (dax -> green).
3. In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red,"" so here ""bluf"" takes on the color red, which is the same as the previous word (wif -> red).
4. In the fourth example, ""wif dax zup bluf"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow,"" which implies ""bluf"" takes on the color yellow, the same as the previous word (zup -> yellow).
5. In the fifth example, ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" gives ""green red green yellow yellow,"" thus ""bluf"" again takes the color yellow, which follows the previous word (zup -> yellow).

Looking at the patterns, we can deduce that ""bluf"" is not taking a fixed color meaning but rather echoing the color of the word that precedes it. The occurrence of ""bluf"" in the sequences corresponds to a repetition of the color output of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-3.1420814128899996,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's identify the patterns associated with the colors in the presented inputs and outputs:

- ""dax"" consistently correlates with ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" consistently correlates with ""red.""

Now let's look at what happens with ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
3. There is no instance of ""bluf"" initiating a sequence, so we do not have an example of ""bluf"" standing alone.

Given the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it. If the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax"" (which outputs green), then ""bluf"" also results in ""green."" If the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif"" or ""zup"" (which output red or yellow respectively), then ""bluf"" leads to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence, with the exception that if preceded by ""wif"" which is red, it results in ""yellow"".",-7.32887936086,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will look for a pattern in each example corresponding to the output colors.

- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" which corresponds to a color ""red"" in the output. However, in example 1, ""wif"" also appears without ""bluf"" and still corresponds to ""red.""
- In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" appears either before ""zup"" or at the end of the input. Every time ""bluf"" appears, the color ""yellow"" follows it in the output.
- ""Dax"" always translates to ""green"" in the output regardless of the position.
- ""Wif"" always translates to ""red"" in the output regardless of the position.
- ""Zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of the position.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" has no direct translation but influences the color of the next word in the sequence. However, since ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" already translate consistently to ""green,"" ""red,"" and ""yellow"" respectively, the presence of ""bluf"" does not seem to change their output. This leads to a contradiction since each word ""bluf"" influences directly has a consistent color output without its influence.

Therefore, considering all given examples, the most consistent rule we can infer is that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" as it is the color that generally follows it, although this does not account for why ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" instead of another ""yellow"" in the first example.

Rule: bluf -> yellow",-7.49770020277,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look at the output associated with each input where ""bluf"" appears:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow red red.""
2. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
3. In all instances, regardless of what precedes ""bluf,"" there is always a ""yellow"" in the output. 

Based on the second bullet point, and given that ""dax"" by itself translates to ""green,"" the presence of a second ""green"" in the output might be influenced by ""bluf."" This suggests that ""bluf"" could also mean green when it follows ""dax.""

However, in the first and third bullet points, the presence of ""bluf"" after ""wif"" leads to a double ""red"" in the output. While the immediate color following ""bluf"" in the output is always ""yellow,"" the color that follows after that seems to depend on the word before ""bluf.""

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

bluf -> yellow

The color that follows seems to be a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word right before ""bluf."" Here's the rule applied to the examples:

1. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red red"" follows, so ""bluf"" causes repeat of the previous color after the ""yellow.""
2. ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""green"" follows again, so ""bluf"" causes repeat of the previous color after the ""yellow.""
3. ""wif"" is ""red,"" and after ""bluf,"" ""red red"" follows again, so ""bluf"" causes repeat of the previous color after the ""yellow.""

This gives us the final rule:

bluf -> yellow, followed by the color corresponding to the word preceding it.",-8.1200401436,151,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after the word in each example and the corresponding outputs. 

Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" produces ""green green green red red red yellow."" Green follows ""dax,"" red follows ""wif,"" and yellow follows ""zup."" The word ""walm"" appears twice and is followed by words that trigger ""green"" and ""red"" respectively.

2. ""lug walm"" yields ""blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" without another following word, and ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" In this case, ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" does not seem to correspond to any output (since it is not followed by any color output), ""wif"" yields ""red,"" and ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red.""

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" We have already established that ""zup"" yields ""yellow,"" and in this context, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" ""Walm"" seems to cause a repeat of the color assigned to the word that follows it, in this case, ""blue"" for ""lug."" ""Wif"" at the end yields ""red.""

5. ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red."" The word ""wif"" yields ""red"" on its own, and since ""walm"" follows, it results in a repetition of ""red.""

Based on the observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the output color associated with the word that immediately follows it.

Thus, the meaning can be written as:

walm -> a function that repeats the color output of the word that comes after it.

If no word follows ""walm,"" it repeats the color of the previous word an additional two times, for a total of three instances of the color output.",-0.9506070562760002,151,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following:

1. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" translates to ""green green green red red red yellow,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could be associated with the words that precede and follow it, each designated by a color. The words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" are each followed by a color: ""dax"" with green, ""wif"" with red, and ""zup"" with yellow. However, ""walm"" is in the middle of these words.

2. In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" does not add a different color but extends the number of times ""blue"" is said.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red,"" showing that ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Bluf"" does not seem to correspond to a color here as it doesn't appear in the output, possibly implying that ""walm"" magnifies the effect of ""wif,"" tripling the ""red"" output.

4. ""zup walm lug wif"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" which shows that ""zup"" and ""lug"" correspond to their individual colors, and again, ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the word it follows.

5. ""wif walm"" leading to ""red red red"" demonstrates that ""walm"" when paired with ""wif,"" multiplies red threefold.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color output of the word that comes immediately before it two additional times, resulting in a total of three instances. If ""walm"" is used more than once in a sequence, it repeats this rule for each occurrence.

Therefore, the meaning associated with ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two more times.",-1.168443499088,151,walm
"From the given examples, we can induce that each word corresponds to a particular color repeated three times, except for the word ""walm"" that seems to cause the color to be repeated one additional time. Here is the breakdown:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" was not translated, but based on the pattern, we can ignore it in the rule induction process.

Given the pattern, ""walm"" appears to amplify the number of times the color following it is repeated by one more time. So, if the word after ""walm"" usually corresponds to the color being repeated three times, when ""walm"" precedes it, the color is instead repeated four times.

Rule: walm -> amplify the repetition of the following color word by one, making it four repetitions instead of three.",-6.023959639040001,151,walm
"Based on the examples given, walm appears to be associated with a series of colors repeated three times. It looks like walm triggers the presence of a specific color, and that color seems to depend on the word preceding walm. Let's examine the given contexts to identify the pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a series of three ""green.""
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a series of three ""blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" followed by something else, the initial two ""yellow"" is not a series of three, suggesting that ""walm"" didn't trigger the color in this case. If followed directly by ""walm,"" then it does trigger three ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a series of three ""red.""
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is a series of three ""red.""

It seems that the general rule for ""walm"" could be that it repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in a series of three. If we associate each word with a specific color:

- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""wif"" and ""bluf"" -> red
- ""zup"" -> yellow

Thus, ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater or amplifier for the color assigned to the preceding word, generating three instances of that color in the output.

- dax lug dax lug walm shows the pattern green blue green blue, followed by a sequence of blue blue, which suggests that walm translates to blue blue (repeated twice). So, dax alone and when followed by lug translates to green.
- lug dax in the third example reaffirms that this combination translates to blue green with lug translating to blue and dax to green as before.
- dax bluf wif zup lug shows dax at the beginning translating to green, followed by other color translations, including bluf as green, wif as red, zup as yellow, and lug as blue.

From the first input-output pair, we observe:
- ""zup lug zup wif dax"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow red green.""
- ""zup"" appears twice, and it corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.

From the second input-output pair:
- ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red.""
- Here, ""zup"" appears once at the beginning and corresponds to ""yellow"" again.

From the third input-output pair:
- ""zup bluf lug dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow blue green blue.""
- ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" which translates to ""yellow.""

From the fourth input-output pair:
- ""zup dax bluf"" translates to ""yellow green green.""
- Again, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

From the fifth input-output pair:
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" and corresponds to a series of ""yellow"" that continues till the end of the sequence.

Based on these observations, we can infer:

Rule:
""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Furthermore, when ""zup"" appears before ""walm,"" it seems to trigger the repetition of ""yellow"" until the sequence ends.

Therefore, ""zup"" seems to mean ""yellow,"" with a potential additional rule when followed by ""walm.""

zup -> ""yellow""",-1.208158956622,152,zup
"Based on the given examples, the following patterns are observed:

- In each instance where ""zup"" is present, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- The word ""bluf"" seems to produce ""yellow"" when following ""zup"" and ""green"" otherwise, which corresponds to ""red"" in the output when it follows ""zup"" or ""green"" when it does not.

The usage of ""zup"" directly correlates with the color ""yellow"" unless followed by ""bluf,"" in which case ""bluf"" takes the color ""yellow"" from the sequence and becomes ""red"" in the output, but normally ""bluf"" correlates to ""green"" in the output.

Given the behavior observed in the inputs and outputs, especially the last example, we can deduce that ""zup"" introduces a repetition of the color ""yellow"" in the output, with the number of times ""yellow"" is repeated being contingent on forthcoming words:

- When there is no subsequent ""bluf"" or ""walm,"" ""zup"" translates to a single ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""bluf"" takes ""yellow"" instead and becomes ""red"" itself.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" there are three instances of ""yellow"" in the output.

Here, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" signals the color ""yellow,"" and subsequent words may alter the number of times ""yellow"" is output or adjust the mapping of the following word.

Thus, the rule can be written as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" -> induces the color ""yellow,"" with potential variations depending on following context.",-5.59374605782,152,zup
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following correspondences:

- zup lug -> yellow blue
- zup wif -> yellow red
- zup dax -> yellow green
- zup bluf -> yellow yellow

Also, individual words seem to have their own translations:
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow
- walm -> yellow yellow yellow

Given these translations, it appears that the word 'zup' on its own translates to 'yellow'. It does seem to matter what follows 'zup'; 'zup' itself remains consistent in translating to 'yellow'. Additionally, when 'zup' is followed by 'walm,' which maps to 'yellow yellow yellow,' it results in one 'yellow' rather than adding to the sequence of 'yellow'. This suggests 'zup' on its own does not multiply or affect the number of times 'yellow' appears for subsequent words.

2. The second example has ""lug"" before ""walm"", where ""lug"" means blue, leading to two repetitions of blue after ""walm"".
3. In the third example, the only word before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which means yellow, so we see three repetitions of yellow.

"Reviewing the examples provided and focusing specifically on the outputs associated with the word ""walm,"" we can attempt to deduce its meaning or the rule it follows.

Let's analyze the occurrences:

1. In the first example, after ""walm,"" we have three instances of the color red.
2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and precedes ""zup,"" which is yellow, but we get three instances of blue before it switches to yellow with ""wif.""

5. In the fifth example, after ""walm,"" we have three yellows following ""zup"" and then it changes to red with ""wif.""

From this analysis, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the preceding word three times before responding to any subsequent input words. If ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, then it seems to repeat the color of the last word just once.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times, or if at the end, repeats the color of the last word once.",-7.0371836801,153,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the previous color mentioned. Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a sequence of the color that precedes it. Here are the observations:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""wif"" correlates to the color red. The output is three reds, thus ""walm"" causes the preceding color (red) to be repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" which correlates to blue, and the output is three blues following it.
- In the third example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" which correlates to yellow, and the output is three yellows.
- The fourth example repeats red three times after ""walm,"" with ""wif"" (red) preceding it.
- The fifth example shows ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three yellows.

"Rule: walm means to repeat the color of the previous word. 

So, the word 'walm' takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color for a number of times dependent on a context we need to determine. We can identify the following patterns:

- After ""dax"" (which means green), ""walm"" produces ""red"" three times.
- After ""lug"" (which means blue), ""walm"" produces ""blue"" once and ""red"" twice.
- After ""zup"" (which means yellow), ""walm"" produces ""yellow"" three times.

Analyzing the patterns, it seems that ""walm"" also pays attention to the position within the sequence and possibly the number of colors that have already been said. There is a consistent pattern where the output color associated with ""walm"" is ""red"" except when following ""zup."" Another observation is that when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color ""yellow,"" equal to the number of words in the input before ""walm.""

However, without more examples or context, specifically regarding the word ""dax,"" it's challenging to determine why ""walm"" follows ""dax"" with three ""red"" colors instead of following the previous color.

Based on the limited data, it's safest to conclude that:

walm -> Repeat the previous word's color. If the previous word is ""zup"" (yellow), repeat yellow as many times as the total number of words preceding ""walm"".

- ""zup"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" before ""bluf"" turns ""bluf"" into ""green.""

If no word precedes ""bluf,"" additional context would be needed to determine its meaning. In the examples where ""bluf"" is followed by another word (""wif""), this does not seem to affect the meaning of ""bluf"" itself but rather adds another color (""red"") at the end of the output sequence.

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let’s first look at the correlation between the inputs and the outputs:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" output.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" when it appears after ""walm"", but before ""walm"", it doesn't influence the output.
- ""walm"" seems to cause the word after it to repeat its associated color three times.
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"" when it doesn't follow ""walm"".
- ""bluf"" correlates with ""green"" when it follows ""dax"", but when it precedes ""dax"" its color is not provided.
- When ""lug"" follows ""walm"", we see ""blue"" output once.

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""zup"" yields three times ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" yields ""red"" three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" again correlates with ""blue"".
- ""walm"" makes ""lug"" repeat the ""blue"" color two more times.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".
- ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" again yields three ""red"".
- ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in repeating ""green"" twice more.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word that directly follows it to be output three times instead of once.

Rule: walm -> Causes the next color to be repeated three times.",-7.567148003014,154,walm
"Based on the examples provided, walm appears to influence the number of times the color word appears in the output. Specifically, it seems to repeat the color associated with the previous word in the input three times in the output. To illustrate:

1. First example: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output, and ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" but isn't followed by ""walm,"" so it does not repeat.

2. Second example: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and every instance of ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated three times. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is treated similarly to ""wif."" ""bluf"" hasn't directly preceded ""walm,"" but when it does, the pattern suggests it would result in its associated color, ""blue,"" being repeated three times. ""lug"" is followed by ""wif,"" and thus doesn't showcase the ""walm"" effect but is shown to relate to ""blue.""

3. Third example: Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. ""wif"" relates to ""red,"" and when it is followed by ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated three times.

4. Fourth example: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""blue"" being repeated three times.

5. Fifth example: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and followed by ""walm,"" it results in ""green"" being repeated three times. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" it results in a single ""blue"" in the output. When ""walm"" is after ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated again three times.

Based on these observations, the rule is as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times in the output.",-9.681934447147999,154,walm
"Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds with the repetition of a color based on the preceding word. Let's look at the data step by step.

In the first example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" to ""red""
- ""zup"" to ""yellow""

The word ""walm"" that follows ""dax"" results in repeating ""green"" two more times (for a total of three ""green"" outputs). When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it results in repeating ""red"" two more times (for a total of three ""red"" outputs). It seems that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the color of the preceding word an additional two times.

The second example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""bluf"" is not followed by ""walm"", it translates directly to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""

After ""walm"" comes the repeated sequence of ""red"", again indicating ""walm"" might signal repetition.

Looking at the other examples, the pattern holds – after the word ""walm,"" the color corresponding to the preceding non-walm word resumes:

Third example (only examining ""walm""):
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
- ""lug walm"" results in two more ""blue""
- ""zup walm"" results in two more ""yellow""
  
Fourth example:
Input: lug walm
- ""lug walm"" results in two more ""blue""

Fifth example (only examining ""walm""):
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
- ""dax walm"" results in two more ""green""

Based on this analysis, we can confidently induce that:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.",-9.708736708705715,154,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" indicates a repetition in color coding of the previous word. Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the word just before it, a certain number of times.

Analyzing the examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"", so ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""green"" three times. It then follows after ""wif"" which corresponds to ""red"", causing ""walm"" to repeat ""red"" three times.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is after “wif” which is ""red"" and repeats the ""red"" three times.
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" and it causes a triple repetition of ""blue"".
- In the fourth example, the only two words are ""lug walm"", implying ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is ""blue"", three times.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" first repeats ""dax"" which is ""green"", three times, and after the ""wif lug dax"" sequence, another ""walm"" repeats ""dax"", which is ""green"", three times.

Rule:

walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

",-10.989723567293998,154,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and the corresponding outputs. 

From the first example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

We can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", the first ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" turns into ""red"", the second ""walm"" also turns into ""red"", and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

From the second example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

This example confirms that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". However, we see that ""walm"" here leads to the color that follows ""wif"" (""red"") being repeated after it. 

From the third example:
Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red

Here, once again, we see that ""walm"" seems to be causing the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it (""lug -> blue"" before ""walm"", resulting in more ""blue"").

From the fourth example:
Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" causes the output to have three repetitions of ""blue"".

From the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

This example further supports the earlier observation. It confirms that ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with the word before it to be repeated three times.

Given the observations from all the examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates that the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is to be repeated three times.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here is the breakdown of each given example:

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow."" Since ""bluf"" has consistently been associated with the color ""blue"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"" as well, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red,"" which supports the deduction from example 1.

3. ""lug walm wif bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red red."" Here ""lug"" is again associated with ""blue,"" and the duplication of ""bluf"" results in two instances of ""red,"" which matches the number of times ""wif"" and ""bluf"" appear respectively. Since ""walm"" is not provided in other examples, we assume it translates to ""blue"" to maintain consistency with the output.

4. ""wif bluf dax"" translates to ""red red green."" Here ""dax"" is new, but by now we know ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is typically ""red"" (when following ""wif""), thus ""dax"" must mean ""green.""

"To deduce the rule for the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will look at the position of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output color. 

From the examples given:

1. Input: zup bluf dax  =>  Output: yellow yellow green
2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf  =>  Output: blue red red green blue blue
3. Input: wif lug zup bluf  =>  Output: red blue yellow yellow
4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax  =>  Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup  =>  Output: red blue blue red yellow

After observing the patterns, the word preceding ""bluf"" corresponds to the color named in the subsequent output:

- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""yellow"" following ""bluf"" in the output.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""red"" following ""bluf"" in the output.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" we have ""blue"" following ""bluf"" in the output.

It seems that the word ""bluf"" changes its output color accordingly to imitate the color associated with the word preceding it:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, we can induce the rule that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it.

"Rule: Based on the given examples, bluf translates to the color yellow when it follows the word zup, while it translates to the color blue when it follows any other word or is at the beginning of the sequence.

- In all other cases, bluf -> blue.",-12.412937805879999,155,bluf

However, when ""bluf"" is repeated or appears after it has already been mentioned in the sequence, it changes to the color ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule we can deduce here is:

Rule: When ""bluf"" appears for the first time or without repetition, it corresponds to ""yellow"". If ""bluf"" is repeated or appears after the first instance within the same sequence, it corresponds to ""blue"".

2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red [green] yellow
3. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue [green]
4. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue [blue]
5. zup walm dax lug -> yellow yellow yellow [green] blue

By inspecting the patterns associated with the word ""walm"" in the provided input and output sequences, we can observe the following:

- Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately after it translates to ""green"" in the output.
- ""Walm"" does not affect the translation of the words that come before it; their corresponding colors do not change whether ""walm"" is present or not.
- The appearance of ""walm"" does not seem to change the output color of any subsequent words either, as seen by comparing the outputs of the first and last examples to the others.

Given these observations, it appears that ""walm"" serves as an indicator for the next word to be translated as ""green,"" but does not contribute a color by itself; it only affects the color translation of the word that follows it.

Rule: walm -> The next word is translated as ""green"".",-1.6359279385199996,155,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. The color output associated with ""walm"" and other words should give us the clues we need. Let's break down each example:

1. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

4. wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Based on these examples, let's look at the consistent placement and output for ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" directly follows ""wif"" and the output for both is red. When ""walm"" appears again, it is preceded by ""lug,"" and the last three colors are blue, which is the color associated with ""lug"" as well.
- In example 2, ""walm"" also follows ""wif"" and the corresponding color is red.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the following colors are all blue, the same as the color for ""lug.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and the output colors are blue following the occurrence of ""walm.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the colors are yellow until ""dax"" occurs, changing the color to green.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater of the color of the word that precedes it. In other words, it causes the output color series to continue with the same color as the preceding word until either the sequence ends or a different word appears that changes the color.

Rule:
walm -> a repeater of the previous color in the sequence until a change is prompted by a new word.",-6.802758273330001,155,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correlation between where ""walm"" appears in the input and the subsequent colors in the output. We can ignore the other words for now, as they correlate consistently to the same color: ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Analyzing the sequences, it becomes evident that ""walm"" causes the color that would correspond to the word following it to repeat until a new word/color appears. For instance, in the first input, after ""walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the color green is repeated until the new word ""zup"" appears, which corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> causes the next color in the sequence to repeat until a different word/color appears.",-6.890092444823999,155,walm
"Rule: walm -> ""repeat the previous color"" 

The word ""walm"" seems to induce the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it in the sequence. Here's how it works with each example:

1. ""wif walm"" -> ""red red"" because ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats it.
2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" repeats it.
3. In sequences with ""dax"" or ""zup"" preceding ""walm,"" the same rule applies. ""dax"" is associated with green and ""zup"" with yellow, so after ""walm"" the same color is repeated.

For instance:

- ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red green""
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm dax"" -> ""blue blue green""",-7.8245382889799995,155,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

3. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green

4. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

5. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Looking at the outputs, it appears that the color output for each word stays static except for when the word ""walm"" is introduced. Observing the placement and effect of ""walm,"" we notice the following:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- When ""walm"" is placed after one of these words, the color associated with that word repeats for as many times as the order number of ""walm"" (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) before the pattern is broken by another word. For example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" showing ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") repeating three times because ""walm"" is the second word in the sequence.

"To figure out what the word ""bluf"" means, let's analyze the appearance of ""bluf"" and its corresponding color in all given examples.

- Example 1: ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"" translates into ""yellow yellow red green red yellow."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds with the second ""yellow.""
- Example 2: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" translates into ""green blue blue blue green red red green."" Here ""bluf"" corresponds with the first ""red.""
- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax"" translates into ""red red green."" In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds with ""red.""
- Example 4: ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates into ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red.""
- Example 5: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates into ""green yellow red red blue."" ""Bluf"" aligns with the second ""red.""

Analyzing these associations, we can notice that ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color. However, it seems to always correspond to the repeated color that immediately follows its occurrence. Looking closely, ""bluf"" always precedes the immediately following word except for the last example where ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and the ""blue"" appears at the end, hence it precedes and doubles the color word that follows it:

- Example 1: ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 2: ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 3: ""dax"" follows ""bluf,"" hence ""red"" (even though it is actually ""green"" for ""dax"") suggests that there might be an exception when ""bluf"" is at the end of the sequence.
- Example 4: ""dax"" follows ""bluf"" and ""red"" is doubled.
- Example 5: ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" and ""blue"" which corresponds to ""lug"" is doubled at the end.

Considering all these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the next color word to be doubled in output. The exception is when ""bluf"" ends the sequence, in which case it may apply to the word that it precedes, if applicable, or the rule doesn't apply since there's no color immediately following to be doubled.

Rule: bluf -> immediately following color is repeated or if it is the final word, the preceding color might be repeated.",-1.170751135898,156,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples where it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""
   
2. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf

5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Looking at the sequences, we can notice the following pattern:
- Every time the word ""bluf"" occurs, the immediate output after is ""red.""
- ""Bluf"" is not always followed by the same word; it can be followed by ""dax,"" ""lug,"" etc., indicating that ""bluf"" does not necessarily change its meaning based on the following word.

From the data provided, it seems that ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: bluf -> red",-7.8281300869570005,156,bluf

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> yellow

Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is red. 

So, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be: 

bluf -> red",-9.854041940140002,156,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds with the color red. However, in the third example, the output includes an extra ""red,"" and in the fourth example, it follows with two ""red"" yet in the previous three examples and fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by one red. It seems to lead to the assumption that ""bluf"" is paired with an additional ""red"" when certain conditions are met. Looking closely at the examples, it seems that the addition of ""red"" in the output sequence is tied to the preceding words. Whenever ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" an extra ""red"" is added in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" If ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by the word ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is included in the output.

Hence, bluf -> red, with a special rule when preceded by ""wif"".",-12.301905248832,156,bluf
"Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the word ""red."" 

Supporting Evidence:

1. Every time the word ""bluf"" is used in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output.
2. ""bluf"" appears to function independently of its position in the list of words, always resulting in ""red."" 

Therefore, bluf -> red.",-13.574064564999997,156,bluf
"From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. 'wif' always translates to 'red'.
2. 'lug' always translates to 'blue'.
3. 'dax' always translates to 'green'.
4. 'zup' always translates to 'yellow'.
5. 'walm' produces a sequence of the color that precedes it in the input.

Analyzing the examples given:

- In the first example, ""wif walm lug bluf"", 'wif' is 'red' and it is followed by 'walm' which leads to a sequence of ""red red red"" before it proceeds with 'lug' and 'bluf', translating to ""blue blue"".
- the second and third examples also show 'walm' producing a sequence of colors matching the preceding word in the input (either 'wif', 'lug', or 'dax').
- The fourth example shows 'lug walm' turning into ""blue blue blue"", again reinforcing that 'walm' repeats the color of the preceding word.
- In the fifth example ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", after 'zup', 'walm' creates more 'yellow' and then the pattern continues normally with the colors for 'wif' and 'lug'.

Given these observations, the rule for 'walm' is that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence, and the number of times it repeats that color is the number of characters 'walm' has, which is three.

Rule: walm -> repeats the previous color three times.",-5.30024050984,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in each of the examples where the word appears and what follows in the output. Let's go through the inputs where ""walm"" appears and see what the associated outputs are:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and ""red"" repeats three times in the output.

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - ""walm"" appears at the end, following ""dax,"" and ""green"" repeats three times in the output.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and precedes ""dax,"" leading to three ""red"" in the output before different colors that correspond to the subsequent words ""dax"" and ""zup.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blue.""

5. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" this time, and again the output associated with it is repeated three times with ""yellow.""

From these observations, a pattern emerges: every time the word ""walm"" is used, the color corresponding to the word immediately following ""walm"" is repeated three times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it takes the color of the word that precedes it and repeats that color three times. This pattern holds true for all given examples. Thus, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color of the word directly after it to be repeated three times in the output. If there is no word after ""walm,"" it causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times.

Or more succinctly,

walm -> repeat the following word's color thrice in the output; or if at the end, repeat the preceding word's color thrice.",-6.3207123981499995,156,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their respective outputs. 

In each example, the word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of the same color that is repeated three times in the output. We can notice that this color changes depending on the word that precedes ""walm.""

1. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
2. In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" but the word ""dax"" precedes it.
3. In ""wif walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" results in ""red red red"" and is preceded by ""wif.""
4. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and is preceded by ""lug.""
5. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and it is preceded by ""zup.""

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it, three times in a row. The color association for other words based on the given examples would be:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" can be described as:
Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times.

- walm -> blue (from the 5th input, it follows a bluf which resulted in yellow, and precedes a dax, which results in blue, and is followed by another lug which also results in blue, walm is thus associated with blue)

We still deduce the meaning of ""dax"" to be ""green"" based on each instance of its occurrence:

1. In the first input, ""dax"" is surrounded by ""wif"" which outputs ""red"", thus ""dax"" in the middle outputs ""green"".
2. In the second input, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and the pattern ""green red"" follows, directly attributing ""green"" to ""dax"".
3. In the third input, ""dax"" on its own outputs ""green"".

In each example, where ""dax"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""green"".

- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
- ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue""

In examining the outputs, it is apparent that ""walm"" produces a sequence of the same color. The color it produces matches the color produced by the word immediately preceding it. For every instance of ""walm"" in the input, the output repeats the color that the previous word represents, as follows:

- lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue (repeats the color of lug)
- zup -> yellow, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug, which is the last non-walm)
- lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug)
- dax -> green, walm -> green green (repeats the color of dax)
- wif -> red, walm -> red red (repeats the color of wif), lug -> blue, walm -> blue blue blue (repeats the color of lug)

"Looking at the patterns in the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a signal to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it continuously until a new color is introduced. Specifically, the repetition continues until either the word ""walm"" or another color word is encountered. Let's check each example to test this rule:

1. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   After ""walm,"" the word ""yellow,"" associated with ""zup,"" is repeated until ""wif"" introduces the color red.

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Here, ""blue,"" associated with ""lug,"" is repeated after ""walm"" until ""zup"" introduces the color yellow again.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   The word ""lug"" is associated with blue, and after ""walm,"" the color blue is repeated with no interruption.

4. Input: lug wif dax walm zup
   Output: blue red green green green yellow

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   ""Red,"" associated with ""wif,"" is repeated after the first ""walm"" until ""dax"" changes the color to green. Then ""wif"" leads back to red, followed by blue from ""lug,"" and after the final ""walm,"" blue is repeated.

The consistent behavior suggests that ""walm"" functions as a repeat signal for the color corresponding to the word immediately before it. Hence, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Based on this analysis, the pattern for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color that follows it two more times. Therefore, if ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" produces ""yellow yellow""; if it is followed by ""blue,"" then ""walm"" produces ""blue blue""; if it is followed by ""green,"" then ""walm"" produces ""green green""; and if it is followed by ""red,"" then ""walm"" produces ""red red"".

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it until a different color word is encountered or the sequence ends. When ""walm"" is encountered in the sequence, the color word that immediately precedes it is repeated in the output for as many times ""walm"" would require until another color word shows up or the sequence ends.

Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", ""wif"" is red and ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" following ""zup"" (yellow) results in two additional yellows before encountering another ""wif"" (red), then it continues with a blue (""lug"").
- In the second example, ""zup dax lug walm zup"", ""zup"" is yellow, ""dax"" is green, and ""lug"" is blue. Here ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) two times until ""zup"" (yellow) is encountered again.
- In the third example, ""lug walm"", there are no other color words after ""walm"", so ""lug"" (blue) is repeated two more times due to ""walm"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax walm zup"", ""lug"" is blue, ""wif"" is red, and ""dax"" is green. ""walm"" causes ""dax"" (green) to be repeated two more times until ""zup"" (yellow) is encountered.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", ""walm"" first causes the repetition of ""wif"" (red) two more times, then after a sequence of colors, a second ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) three times.

"Observing the inputs and outputs carefully, you can notice a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color(s).

In each example, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by a series of ""blue"" in the output, and the number of ""blue"" corresponds to the number of words following ""walm"" in the input, plus one. There are no instances of ""walm"" being the last word in the input to contradict this observation.

Let's verify the rule with the examples:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by two words (""zup""), which results in two ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by no words, which results in zero ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by no words, hence again we have zero ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

4. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Pattern: The first ""walm"" is followed by three words (""zup lug wif""), which results in three ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"". The second ""walm"" is followed by one word (""zup""), which results in one ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Pattern: ""walm"" is followed by two words (""lug wif""), which results in two ""blue"" plus one additional ""blue"" for ""walm"" itself.

Considering these observations, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" is translated as ""blue"", and it causes every word after it, up to the next color word, to be translated as ""blue"" as well.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the input-output patterns.

- In the first input, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and the corresponding output colors turn from one instance of blue to three instances of blue followed by yellow.
- In the second input, ""walm"" is also followed by a color transition in the output from blue to blue. 
- In the third input, ""walm"" is directly after ""lug,"" and the output is consistent blue.
- In the fourth input, the presence of ""walm"" precedes a change from various colors to a repeated pattern of red in the output, interrupted by yellow and blue which correlate with ""zup"" and ""lug.""
- Finally, in the fifth input, ""walm"" seems to act as a modifier, turning the output into repeating the color yellow three times, followed by the colors that correspond to ""lug"" and ""wif.""

From these examples, we can infer that the word ""walm"" creates a repetition of the color naming that comes immediately after it in the sequence. However, the number of repetitions appears to be variable, and it seems to depend on other factors, possibly the words that come after ""walm"" or the sequence of colors that occurred directly before it.

With the given data, ""walm"" seems to induce repetition in color naming. However, without knowing the exact rules governing the number of repetitions or how to anticipate when and where ""walm"" ends its repetition effect, we can only tentatively conclude:

So, it can be concluded that ""walm"" repeats the color that was most recently mentioned a number of times equal to the number of times that word appears in the input before ""walm"".

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the color word preceding ""walm"" for as many times as the preceding color word occurs in the input sequence before ""walm"".",-4.712849750402,159,walm
"From the given examples, we can infer that ""walm"" does not correspond to a single static color or word; instead, its output changes based on the context provided by the words that come before it. Let us analyze the patterns in each example to attempt rule induction:

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in ""yellow"" repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""walm"" follows ""lug zup"" and the output is a repeat of ""yellow"" for however many words came before ""walm"", followed by the color corresponding to ""lug"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""walm"" follows ""wif zup bluf lug"" and the output repeats ""blue"" for each word preceding ""walm"", followed by the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""lug"".

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax wif"" and the output is ""red"" repeated for the number of words before ""walm"", followed by the colors corresponding to ""lug"" and ""zup"".

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it outputs the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeated as many times as there are words before ""walm"", with the outputs for words following ""walm"" appended accordingly.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word for the count equal to the number of words before ""walm"", followed by translating any subsequent words into their corresponding colors.",-5.795339134884,159,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" causes the preceding word to be repeated three times, reflected in the corresponding color. Here is a breakdown showing the pattern:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Input: dax wif walm lug zup -> Output: green red red red blue yellow

In each case, the word that appears before ""walm"" is translated into its color form three times in a row in the output. For example, in the first example, ""zup"" is translated as ""yellow"", and then, because it is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be outputted three times.",-5.941785752674998,159,walm
"Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" indicates that the colors should be repeated in sequence for an amount of times equal to the total count of color words that appear before ""walm"" in the input sentence.

Here is the breakdown according to the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears once before ""walm,"" and its associated color is ""yellow."" The output is ""yellow"" repeated once (total count of color words).
- In the second example, ""lug"" appears once before ""walm,"" and its associated color is ""blue."" The output is ""blue"" repeated once (total count of color words).
- In the third example, ""lug"" appears once and ""zup"" once before ""walm,"" the output is each color word repeated once since there are two color words, so ""blue yellow"" is the pattern, but then ""lug"" appears again after ""walm,"" so another ""blue"" is added at the end.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" (red) appears once, ""zup"" (yellow) once, ""bluf"" has no color associated but ""lug"" (blue) appears once before ""walm."" This makes three color-associated words before ""walm,"" and thus the output sequence repeats ""red yellow blue"" once, and since ""lug"" (blue) appears again after ""walm,"" one ""blue"" is added at the end, followed by ""dax"" (green) once, which adds ""green"" and one more ""lug"" (blue) adds another ""blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" (green) appears once, ""wif"" (red) once, before ""walm,"" so the output repeats ""green red"" two times as there are two colors, then followed by ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow) once each after ""walm,"" thus adding ""blue yellow"" to the end.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat each distinct color word, in the order they appear, for the total count of color-associated words that appear before ""walm"" in the input. If a color-associated word appears after walm in the input, it is added once to the end of the sequence.",-6.92110424338,159,walm

"Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to be associated with the word ""green."" However, it's not that simple since the output color depends on the position and/or combination with other words. Let's analyze the examples provided to find out the underlying rule:

1. ""dax bluf"" leads to ""green green,"" so ""bluf"" could mean ""green,"" but only if ""dax"" also means ""green.""

2. ""dax bluf zup"" leads to ""green green yellow."" Here, ""zup"" appears to mean ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" still leads to ""green"" when adjacent to ""dax.""

3. ""zup wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow red red."" Now ""bluf"" results in ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""zup"" still produces ""yellow.""

4. ""wif zup dax bluf"" leads to ""red yellow green green."" Thus, ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" when it comes after ""dax,"" and other words have consistent meanings.

5. ""wif bluf lug zup"" leads to ""red red blue yellow."" Here, ""bluf"" seems to stand for ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" and ""lug"" seems to mean ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" means ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""red"" when it follows ""wif."" There's not enough data to say what ""bluf"" means in other contexts.

Rule: ""bluf"" means ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif."" For other contexts, more data is needed.",-0.77176291704,160,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" prompts the repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Examining the examples:

- When ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When ""dax"" (green) is followed by ""bluf"" and then by ""zup"" (yellow), the output is ""green green yellow."" Here ""bluf"" repeats the green from ""dax.""
- When ""wif"" (red) is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" is causing a repetition of the red associated with ""wif.""
- When ""wif zup dax"" (red yellow green) is followed by ""bluf,"" the color associated with the immediate predecessor of ""bluf"" (""dax,"" which is green) is repeated, and the output is ""red yellow green green.""
- In the final example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" (red red blue yellow), ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the immediate output is a repetition of the red color, confirming that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the preceding color.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word.",-1.19466947874,160,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's investigate the relation between input and output in each given example:

- In the first example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" Since ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" we can infer that ""bluf"" perhaps also translates to ""green"" in this instance.
- In the second example, ""dax bluf zup"" leads to ""green green yellow."" Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" this supports the idea that ""bluf"" means ""green.""
- The third example, ""zup wif bluf,"" corresponds to ""yellow red red."" Given ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" typically translating to ""red,"" this further implies that ""bluf"" could again mean ""red.""
- For the fourth example, ""wif zup dax bluf"" maps to ""red yellow green green."" Here, the known translations of ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" support the translation of ""bluf"" to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" aligns with ""red red blue yellow."" Since ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" it suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" in this context.

The pattern seems complex, and the meaning of ""bluf"" appears context-dependent. A potential rule could be related to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" it results in ""green green,"" suggesting a doubling or agreement rule. When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" which again could suggest a doubling effect. However, when ""bluf"" is surrounded by different words with no immediate repeated word before it, the output for ""bluf"" is an entirely new color, complicating the rule.

Given this complexity and without further examples or clearer rules governing the outputs, it's challenging to deduce a single consistent rule for ""bluf."" However, we might speculate:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on its position and the words around it, potentially doubling the color attribute imposed by the word just before it if that word is either ""dax"" or ""wif."" However, this proposed rule is not fully consistent with the available information, and ""bluf"" may be contextually defined in a more complex manner that requires additional data to understand completely.",-1.36004858854,160,bluf
"By analyzing the pattern from the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the doubling of the color associated with the previous word. See how ""bluf"" converts ""dax"" to ""green green"" rather than just ""green,"" how it converts ""wif"" to ""red red"" instead of just ""red,"" and how ""lug"" becomes ""blue blue"" instead of just ""blue"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before bluf in the sequence.",-4.553978280228,160,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can make some observations:

1. The output is a sequence of color words.
2. Each color in the output corresponds to a word in the input.
3. The color ""green"" only appears after the word ""dax"".
4. The color ""yellow"" is associated with the word ""zup"".
5. The color ""red"" is associated with the word ""wif"" (this is determined by the third sequence, where ""wif"" is the only word before ""bluf"" and the colors are ""yellow red red""; ""zup"" accounts for ""yellow"", leaving ""red red"" for ""wif"" and ""bluf"").
6. No other word in the inputs seems to be directly contributing to color words in the output, except for ""lug"" once, which corresponds to ""blue"".

Since ""bluf"" seems to cause the appearance of a second color linked to the word immediately preceding it, we can gather:

- When ""dax"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""zup"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow red"".
- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by words that are not associated with a color in the examples (""lug zup""), the output after ""bluf"" appears random or not clearly defined, hence ""red blue"" after ""wif bluf lug"".

Given these observations, we can conclude that the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it. If there is no word immediately before it or if the preceding word doesn't have an established color association, its behavior is not clearly defined from these examples.

Thus:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: When following a word, ""bluf"" causes the output to include a duplicate of the color associated with that word.",-5.06660788344,160,bluf
"Based on the given examples, ""walm"" appears to be related to the color associated with the preceding word, and it repeats that color an equivalent number of times the ""walm"" phrase appears. Let's break down the examples:

1. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"" and ""wif"" by ""red"", but ""walm"" yields ""red red red"".

2. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green"":
   ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", and ""walm"" yields ""green green green"".

3. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", and ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"".

4. ""wif walm dax"" -> ""red red red green"":
   ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", ""walm"" yields ""red red red"", and ""dax"" is followed by ""green"".

5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red"":
   ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"", ""walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow"", ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"", ""wif"" by ""red"", and ""bluf"" is not defined in the given examples.

From these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it replaces that word's corresponding color and repeats that color an equivalent number of times ""walm"" appears.

Therefore, the definition of ""walm"" seems to be:
walm -> A repeat function to multiply the output of the previous color word by the number of times ""walm"" appears.",-1.104371926904,160,walm
"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the color word that follows it to be repeated three times in the output. If there is no color word following ""walm,"" the color associated with the word right before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since ""wif"" comes before ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so the output is ""green"" three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so the output is ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, thus the output is ""red"" three times followed by green once, which corresponds to ""dax.""
- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, leading to ""yellow"" repeated thrice, followed by ""blue"" for ""bluf"" and ""red"" twice for ""wif.""",-3.8224773310400004,160,walm
"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: The output for ""walm"" is the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" For each occurrence of ""walm,"" output the color of the previous word the number of times ""walm"" has been mentioned in that specific sequence.

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" leads to red being repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""walm"" leads to yellow being repeated three times.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so the first ""walm"" results in red being repeated, followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to a single green.
- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so the first ""walm"" leads to yellow being repeated three times (as it's the third overall mention of ""walm""), followed by ""lug,"" which doesn't seem to correspond to a color and ""wif bluf"" corresponding to red and blue.",-5.1538382535,160,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns within each output in relation to its corresponding input.

- In the input ""zup wif walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds with ""red red red.""
- However, in the inputs ""dax walm"" and ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" corresponds with ""green green green"" and ""yellow yellow yellow,"" respectively.

The outputs for ""walm"" change based on the preceding word: 
- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of ""green.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""walm"" is a repetition of ""red.""

The data suggest ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated three times, and the color is determined by the word that precedes ""walm."" 

With this rule in mind, let's write out the definition as requested:

"walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: 'lug' corresponds to the color blue.",-7.90812639376,161,lug
"Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""dax"" and the other words in context:

- ""dax"" on its own corresponds to the color ""green.""
- Each unique word following ""dax"" corresponds to a different color.
- The word ""walm"" whenever it occurs following ""dax"" is translated as repeating the color ""green"" thrice.

Now, let's analyze the inputs against the outputs to identify each word's associated color:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Rule: ""dax"" -> ""green""

2. Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" occurs twice and each time it corresponds to ""yellow"". ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". 

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color ""green"".

4. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   Rule: Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The ""walm"" again triggers three repetitions of the color ""green"", but this time since ""red"" came just before it, ""walm"" might translate to three repetitions of the immediately preceding color. 

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   Rule: Consistent with the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Based on these observations, the working rule induction for ""dax"" and subsequent words is:

""dax"" -> ""green""
""lug"" -> ""blue""
""wif"" -> ""red""
""zup"" -> ""yellow""
""walm"" -> repeat the color that comes before it three times

If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" immediately, the color repeated is ""green""; if it follows another color, it repeats that color thrice.",-3.312109775037,161,dax
"To induce the rule, let's examine the given examples and find a consistent pattern for the word ""dax"" and the other words that come after it:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"":
   Input: dax
   Output: green

2. When ""dax"" appears with other words, each word corresponds to a color:
   Input: dax zup lug wif zup
   Output: green yellow blue red yellow

   - Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

3. When ""dax"" appears with ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is repeated thrice, suggesting that ""walm"" might induce repetition:
   Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" to ""green"" repeated thrice.

4. Similarly, ""walm"" following other words results in the previous color being repeated:
   Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

   - ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice more. 

5. In an instance without ""walm,"" two words consistently correspond to their colors without repetition:
   Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

   - ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

With the evidence provided, we can conclude the following rules:

- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""
- ""walm"" -> Repeat the previous color two additional times

Rule:
Based on the given examples, ""dax"" consistently means ""green."" Other words following ""dax"" map to specific colors, and the word ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat twice more.",-3.3835856888320004,161,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce a pattern that defines what ""dax"" means in this context. We will try to infer the meaning of ""dax"" by examining how it appears to correspond with the output across the different inputs.

First, every input example starts with the word ""dax,"" and every output example starts with the color ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Now let's examine the rest of the outputs in relation to their inputs:

Input: dax
Output: green

Here, ""dax"" is the only word, and ""green"" is the only color.

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Here, ""zup"" is used twice and its color equivalent (from output) is ""yellow,"" which is also repeated twice. We can reasonably assume that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The words ""lug"" and ""wif"" map to ""blue"" and ""red,"" respectively, in this output.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

The word ""walm"" leads to three ""green"" colors. This suggests that ""walm"" could amplify or repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it. In this case, since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which we've deduced means ""green,"" ""walm"" seems to cause the ""green"" to be repeated thrice.

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

- In the second example, ""zup"" is isolated and the output is solely ""yellow.""
- The third example demonstrates that ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""wif walm,"" and the output starts with ""yellow"" followed by another ""yellow,"" and then ""red red red"" corresponding to the rest of the input.

- In the fifth example, similarly, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice.

- In ""lug zup walm lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and the first appearance of ""walm"" is immediately preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow. After ""walm,"" yellow is repeated.
  
- In ""zup walm wif,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""walm"" follows, and yellow is repeated before moving on to red for ""wif.""

"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that directly follows ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or ""wif."" Here's how ""walm"" operates in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" Therefore, ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to ""lug"" (which is blue) three times, and it repeats the color corresponding to ""zup"" (which is yellow) three times.

2. In the second example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue,"" again repeating the color for ""lug"" three times.

3. The third example, ""wif walm,"" results in ""red red red,"" repeating the color for ""wif"" three times.

4. The fourth example has ""wif walm"" producing ""red red red"" two times, with ""zup"" intervening between two instances of ""wif walm.""

5. In the fifth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the color for ""zup"" three times.

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".
- When ""walm"" is not present, the word is translated into its corresponding color once.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding word's color thrice.",-7.00463589338,162,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should analyze the patterns in the input and corresponding output:

From the first input-output pair:

- Input: lug walm zup walm
- Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow

This suggests ""walm"" might correspond to the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow.""

However, let's consider the second input-output pair:

- Input: zup lug walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue,"" so ""walm"" might correspond to the remaining output ""blue.""

Now let's examine the third input-output pair:

- Input: dax lug wif walm
- Output: green blue red red red

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Hence ""walm"" must correspond to ""red red.""

This is similar to the fourth input-output pair:

- Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
- Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" must correspond to ""yellow"" as it is what remains for the first walm and ""red red red"" for the second walm occurrence considering the sequence we see.

Finally,

- Input: dax zup walm wif
- Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

We can say ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to the sequence ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- When ""dax walm lug"" is the input, the output is ""green green green blue.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""green"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif walm dax"" is the input, the output is ""red red red green.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""red"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif lug walm"" is the input, the output is ""red blue blue blue.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""blue"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""wif walm"" is the input, the output is ""red red red.""
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""red"" (repeated for emphasis).

- When ""dax walm zup walm"" is the input, the output is ""green green green yellow yellow yellow.""
  - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
  - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
  - ""walm"" must correspond to ""green"" and ""yellow"" (repeated for emphasis both times).

Looking at the patterns, ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.

However, for the input ""wif walm,"" we have only ""red red red,"" even though no other word follows ""walm.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns and associations in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue."" We see that ""dax"" corresponds to the first ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and the triple ""green"" must correspond to ""walm.""

- In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" leads to ""red red red green."" Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and again, ""walm"" seems to result in a triplet of the color associated with the preceding word.

- The third example, ""wif lug walm,"" gives us ""red blue blue blue."" This time, ""walm"" comes at the end after ""lug,"" which is associated with ""blue,"" and the output has three ""blue"" instead of just one.

- The fourth example, ""wif walm,"" translates to ""red red red."" This consolidates the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word thrice.

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm zup walm,"" corresponds to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""dax"" is followed by three ""green,"" and a new word ""zup"" is introduced, followed by three ""yellow,"" confirming that ""walm"" means repetition.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

So the deduction is:
walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word three times.",-1.15350447378,163,walm
"Given the examples provided, it looks like the word ""walm"" translates into a sequence of three repeated colors. However, the specific color that ""walm"" corresponds to seems to be determined by the word that comes before it. 

For the first and fourth examples:
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green""
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red""

From this pattern, it seems that when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it turns into ""green"" repeated three times, and when it follows ""wif,"" it turns into ""red"" repeated three times.

For the third example:
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue""
This is the case when ""walm"" follows ""lug.""

However, in the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by another word (""zup""), which shows a different pattern:
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""

In essence, ""walm"" appears to be a repeating pattern of a color, and the exact color is dependent on the preceding word.

Rule: walm -> a sequence of three colors, with the specific color being determined by the word that immediately precedes ""walm."" Here's the mapping according to the given examples:

- Input: wif lug walm -> Output: red blue blue blue
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the examples:

Output: red red red green

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

From the examples we can observe:

1. ""dax walm"" consistently results in ""green green green"" and ""wif walm"" consistently results in ""red red red"", suggesting that 'walm' might be a repeat of the color stated before it.
2. ""walm"" at the end of ""wif lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue blue,"" the same color that corresponds to the word ""lug"" seen in the first input.
3. In every instance, ""walm"" causes a repetition of three colors, which seems to be derived from whatever word precedes it, i.e., it copies the color of the previous word three times.

However, when we consider the last input where ""walm"" is repeated:

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

We do not see ""green"" repeated six times; instead, we see ""green"" repeated three times followed by ""yellow"" repeated three times. This suggests that ""walm"" might require the repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm"".

This leads us to conclude that ""walm"" causes the output color to repeat three times, based on the color associated with the word that comes before it. When ""walm"" follows immediately after another ""walm,"" it takes the color from the word that came before the first ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color output of the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" follows another ""walm,"" it maintains the pattern by taking the color of the word that preceded the first ""walm"".",-7.693296142749091,163,walm

2. When ""lug"" is used in conjunction with ""dax"" (Input: dax lug, dax lug walm), ""dax"" precedes ""blue"" with ""green"".
3. When ""lug"" is used with ""zup"" (Input: lug zup), ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

The result is green for each word before ""wif"" and then red immediately after.

In the second example:
Input: dax lug dax wif dax

The pattern of colors (green blue green) is broken by ""wif"", which yields red, and then the sequence starts again with ""dax"" resulting in green.

In the third example:
Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Here, ""lug"" gives blue, and after ""wif"" the color changes to green.

In the fourth example:
Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

Again, we see ""wif"" introduces red after a sequence of other color outputs.

In the last example:
Input: zup lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow blue yellow red green

The pattern 'yellow blue yellow' is broken by ""wif"", which yields red, and then 'dax' gives green.

Putting all these observations together, it seems that ""wif"" acts as a signifier indicating the end of a sequence and precedes a change in the output pattern. In the given examples, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" which does not correspond to any of the previous words in the sequence.

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" is the fourth word and it corresponds to ""red.""
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is the fifth word (before the last) and it also results in ""red.""

However, in Example 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" not ""red."" In this case, ""bluf"" is followed by no other words and is preceded by a repetition (""lug bluf"" following ""wif walm"").

Furthermore, in Example 4 and Example 5, it's seen that when ""bluf"" immediately follows ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""blue,"" not ""red.""

Combining the observed patterns, it is possible to induce that the rule for ""bluf"" is likely context-dependent, with ""bluf"" corresponding to ""red"" unless it directly follows ""lug"" or is the final word in a repeated sequence, in which case it could be ""blue.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we can look at the pattern of the inputs and their respective outputs to determine the relationship between the two.

From the examples given:
- ""wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""red blue green green green,"" so when we add ""walm"" to ""dax,"" we get repeated ""green.""
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" it's producing repeated ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm wif walm zup"" outputs ""green green green red red red yellow,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" is repeating ""green,"" but after ""wif,"" it is repeating ""red,"" and then ""zup"" follows, breaking the repetition with a single ""yellow.""
- ""dax lug walm"" outputs ""green blue blue blue,"" so when ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it gives repeated ""blue.""
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" outputs ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow,"" in which ""walm"" follows ""zup"" for a repetition of ""yellow.""

The pattern indicates that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it to repeat. If no word precedes ""walm,"" the default appears to be ""yellow,"" as seen in the example ""zup walm"" - there is nothing before ""zup,"" and yet the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" can be defined as:
walm -> causes repetition of the color associated with the previous word. If no word precedes it, the repeated color is yellow.",-1.20909539106,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns of input and corresponding outputs:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated multiple times.
- The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" has appeared plus one for the first instance of the word following it in the sequence.
- The color that ""walm"" represents is the same as the color the word immediately preceding ""walm"" represents.

In the first example:
- ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" (which is green) three times, since it's the first appearance of ""walm"".

The second example:
- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" replicates the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

The third example:
- ""dax walm"" again leads to ""green green green.""
- In the same line, ""wif walm"" yields ""red red red."" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and since this is the second appearance of ""walm"" in this sequence, it's repeated two times (plus one for the first instance).

The fourth example:
- ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" takes the color of ""lug"" and repeats it two additional times.

Finally, the fifth example:
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the color of ""zup"" (yellow) three times.

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately prior to be repeated a number of times equal to the occurrence of ""walm"" in the sequence plus one for the first instance of the word following it in the sequence.

walm -> meaning: when following a color word, it repeats that color's output a number of times based on its sequential appearance, with an additional repetition for the first instance.",-4.29241078366,164,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the examples provided and identify the pattern of colors associated with ""walm."" Here's a breakdown of each input and its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - The colors red, blue, and green are associated with ""wif,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" individually. After ""walm"" is introduced, only green is repeated.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Zup"" is associated with yellow, and after ""walm"" there are two more yellows, indicating repetition.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - For ""dax"" the color is green, and after ""walm,"" green is repeated. After ""wif"" the color is red, followed by ""walm"" and then more red colors. ""Zup"" follows with single yellow, meaning ""walm"" was not at the end in this case to continue the repetition.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""Dax"" is green and ""lug"" is blue, following ""walm"" there is a repetition of blue.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, the pattern remains consistent with individual colors associated with the words, but after the last ""zup"" and ""walm,"" the pattern shows an extended repetition of yellow.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the sequence, the output color is a repetition of the previous color associated with the word right before ""walm.""

Therefore, the definition is:

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.",-6.221910695415001,164,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" outputs a sequence of the last color mentioned before it. Here is how the rule appears to apply in each example:

1. Input: wif lug dax walm

   - The word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. After ""walm,"" we see a sequence of green.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. After ""walm,"" we see a sequence of yellow.

3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - The words before the first ""walm"" are ""dax,"" corresponding to green, and before the second ""walm"" is ""wif,"" corresponding to red. After the first ""walm,"" we see a sequence of green, and after the second ""walm,"" we see a sequence of red, followed by the sequence of yellow after ""zup.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. After ""walm,"" we see a sequence of blue.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - The word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" which corresponds to the color yellow. After ""walm,"" we see a sequence of yellow.

Given these observations, we can conclude the rule for ""walm"":

1. When ""lug walm wif lug"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue."" The word ""lug"" is associated with the color ""blue"" in both its appearances; ""wif"" results in ""red.""

2. ""Dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""dax"" seems to produce the color ""green.""

4. ""Lug zup walm lug"" results in ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Again, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

5. Finally, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" leads to ""yellow green green green yellow red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word. This repetition occurs thrice before moving on to the next word:

- In the first input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue"" being repeated three times (since ""lug"" correlates with blue).
- In the second input, ""dax walm"" repeats ""green"" three times (as ""dax"" is linked with green).
- Similarly, in the third input, ""zup walm"" yields three ""yellow"" colors because ""zup"" is associated with yellow.

- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""

- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: wif -> red",-4.02579168563,166,wif
"From the examples provided, we can infer the following color associations:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- dax -> green

Now, by looking at the examples and deducing the position and associated colors of ""wif,"" the pattern suggests that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color red. Here is the breakdown:

- Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
- Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Input: lug wif dax -> Output: blue red green
- Input: lug wif lug -> Output: blue red blue
- Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red

Output: red blue

Third example:
Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green

Fourth example:
Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue

Fifth example:
Input: dax lug wif

From these examples, we can see that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. It’s also positioned as the same word order - 1st word to 1st color, 2nd word to 2nd color and so on. This indicates that ""wif"" correlates directly to ""red."" 

Rule:

Example 2:
- Input: wif lug

Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Example 3:
- Input: lug wif dax

Yet again, ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

Example 5:
- Input: dax lug wif
- Output: green blue red

- The word ""zup"" does not seem to alter its meaning based on position in the input sequence.
- Other words like ""dax"", ""wif"", and ""lug"" consistently map to colors ""green"", ""red"", and ""blue"" respectively, regardless of their position in relation to ""zup"".

Given these observations, the rule seems to be clear:

"Based on the examples provided, we can see a repetition of colors corresponding to the words preceding and following the nonce word 'walm.'

Let's analyze each example and identify patterns:

1. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
2. dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red
4. wif walm zup walm -> red red red yellow yellow yellow
5. dax walm wif walm zup -> green green green red red red yellow

From these examples, we can see that the output color that corresponds to 'walm' repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it:

- In Example 1, 'zup' proceeds 'walm' and the output is 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- In Example 2, 'wif' proceeds 'walm' and the output corresponding to 'walm' is 'red red red'; 'zup' proceeds the second 'walm', hence the output 'yellow yellow yellow'.
- In Example 3, 'zup' proceeds 'walm' with the output 'yellow yellow yellow' and follows 'wif' with the output 'red'.
- In Example 4, 'wif' proceeds both instances of 'walm' and the corresponding outputs are 'red red red' and 'yellow yellow yellow' from 'zup'.
- In Example 5, 'dax' proceeds the first 'walm' and 'wif' proceeds the second. The outputs are 'green green green' and 'red red red' respectively. 'Zup' which comes after the second 'walm' is not repeated since it does not precede a 'walm'.

From this, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

- When ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""wif walm"" appears, the output is ""red red red.""

Observing the above, it seems that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times.

According to the examples:
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

Thus, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color tied to the preceding word three times.",-4.695412343102,166,walm
"Analyzing the examples and their respective outputs, it appears that the word ""walm"" is repeated in the output the number of times it appears in the input. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it generates three occurrences of the color that corresponds to the word preceding it.

Here are the precedents:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Now, let's apply this understanding to each example:

1. ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" (since ""zup"" precedes ""walm"")
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" leads to a sequence where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and ""zup,"" leading to ""red red red"" and then ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""zup walm wif"" has ""walm"" following ""zup,"" thus ""yellow yellow yellow"" and ""wif"" with no ""walm"" after leads to a single ""red""
4. ""wif walm zup walm"" follows with ""red red red"" for the ""wif walm"" and then ""yellow yellow yellow"" for ""zup walm""
5. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green"" for ""dax walm"" then ""red red red"" for ""wif walm"" and the final ""yellow"" corresponds to the single ""zup"" without another ""walm"" for repetition.

From this, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" translates to three repeated instances of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Thus:
walm -> three repeated instances of the color corresponding to the preceding word.",-4.893580995280001,166,walm
"Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating of the color associated with the word that precedes it. The number of repetitions is three. Here's how the rule applies to each example:

- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeated three times.
- In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" so ""walm"" following ""wif"" leads to ""red"" repeated three times. ""Zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" which leads to ""yellow"" repeated three times.

- In ""wif walm zup walm,"" ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" three times, and ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" three times.
- In ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green"" three times, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" three times, and finally, ""zup"" stands alone, representing ""yellow.""

- When ""dax walm"" is used, the output is three ""green.""
- The color pattern is consistent whether ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax.""

From the examples we can induce the following rule:

"Analyzing the provided examples, let's try to identify patterns associated with the word ""lug"" and its respective output color.

Example 1:
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this sequence, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup"" and the corresponding colors are ""yellow blue.""

Example 2:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the colors are ""blue blue blue.""

Example 3:
Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

In this case, ""lug"" is the first word, and it's followed by ""dax,"" with colors ""blue green.""

Example 4:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

Here again, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the colors are ""blue blue blue.""

Example 5:
Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Once more, ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" and the colors are ""blue green.""

From these observations, we can notice that:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color blue is always the first color in the output.
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" we see a sequence of blue colors (three times blue in the given examples).
- ""Lug"" itself is represented by the color blue in every example.

Based on these patterns, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Whether ""lug"" results in multiple instances of blue or just a single blue may depend on what word follows ""lug,"" but since the word ""lug"" consistently translates to at least the first blue in the sequence, the simplest interpretation is that ""lug"" means blue.

The word ""dax"" appears in each input and is always followed by the output ""green."" It does not seem to matter where ""dax"" appears in the sequence; its presence always results in the color ""green.""

Given this pattern, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be established as follows:

Rule: When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will have the color ""green"" corresponding to it.",-6.422364784388,167,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can infer that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs.

- In every example where ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
- ""Dax"" is consistent in its translation to ""green;"" it does not change depending on its position in the list or the presence of other words.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we'll first examine each provided example and output sequence to see if there are any patterns.

Example 1: 
Input: wif
Output: red

Example 2: 
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Example 3:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Example 4:
Input: wif zup lug
Output: red yellow blue

Example 5:
Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green

Based on Example 1, it can be concluded that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

In Example 2, the addition of ""zup"" before ""wif"" adds ""yellow"" before ""red"" in the output, suggesting a one-to-one correspondence between input words and output colors (zup -> yellow, wif -> red).

Example 3 confirms this one-to-one correspondence, showing ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and ""walm"" also produces ""red."" This is our first sign that more than one word might produce the same output color, but more data is needed to confirm if ""walm"" always produces ""red"" or if there are more complex rules.

In Example 4, the output follows a one-to-one correspondence according to the position of the word in the input sequence: ""wif"" produces ""red,"" ""zup"" produces ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" produces ""blue.""

Example 5 further supports that ""wif"" maps to ""red"" regardless of its position, ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

Based on the information provided, the rule for ""wif"" seems straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red

However, this rule is derived under the assumption that each word in the input directly maps to a color in the output based on the position and that each input word has a fixed corresponding color as an output.

"Based on the examples provided and the consistent outputs correlating with the presence of the nonce word ""zup,"" we can deduce the meaning of ""zup.""

When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output invariably starts with ""yellow."" In the absence of any other words, ""zup"" alone just outputs ""yellow."" Therefore, it appears that ""zup"" correlates directly to the color ""yellow.""

In all examples, ""zup"" appears to maintain this one-to-one relationship with ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This is shown by the fact that it precedes or follows other words while still outputting ""yellow"" in its respective position. There doesn't seem to be a positional rule or a contextual change in meaning depending on where ""zup"" is located in the sequence. 

However, to form a more comprehensive rule, we also need to consider the other words and their outputs. ""Wif"" consistently corresponds to a single ""red,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" hence their patterns are simpler to discern. ""Bluf"" is always followed by ""yellow red,"" but since ""zup"" already means ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" probably means just ""red.""

Conclusively, we can write the rule as:

3. ""lug zup bluf dax"" results in ""blue yellow yellow green."" In this sequence, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in another ""yellow,"" duplicating the color of the word just before it.

4. ""lug bluf"" produces ""blue blue,"" following the established pattern of duplicating the color associated with the preceding word.

5. Lastly, ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" gives us ""yellow yellow red green blue."" Once more, ""bluf"" after ""zup"" yields a second ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be defined as follows:

5. zup bluf wif dax lug -> yellow yellow red green blue

In each case where the word `bluf` appears in the input, the output consists of two identical colors. The color matches the color output for the word that immediately precedes `bluf`. Therefore, the rule seems to be that `bluf` doubles the color output of the word that comes before it.

In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red"". Hence, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" causes it to be repeated.

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output has ""green green"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Again, ""bluf"" causes the preceding color to be repeated.

In the third example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", and the output features ""yellow yellow"", meaning ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" caused the repetition.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", which results in ""blue blue"" in the output, therefore ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" replicates this color in the output.

In the final example, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" again, and as before, the output repeats ""yellow"" as ""yellow yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red"" again referring back to ""wif.""

"From the examples provided, it seems that walm indicates a repetition of the color that corresponds with the previous word. 

For example:
- In ""wif lug walm"", ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", which follows ""lug"" being blue.
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" gives green, so ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" following ""lug"" being blue again.
- In ""lug zup walm lug"", ""zup"" equals yellow, thus ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", and is followed by ""lug"", which is blue.
- ""wif walm zup"", where ""wif"" is red, gives us ""red red red"" for ""walm"", followed by ""zup"" which is yellow.
- ""dax wif walm"", has ""wif"" corresponding to red, so ""walm"" gives ""red red red"" following ""wif"".

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, three times.

Let's break it down:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" we see ""blue blue blue."" Since ""lug"" is before ""walm,"" it must correlate to blue, thus ""walm"" repeats the blue three times.
- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" the output is ""blue blue blue"" again, which is consistent with the rule since ""lug"" just before ""walm"" corresponds to blue.
- In the third example, ""lug zup walm lug"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is three yellows, this supports the rule as ""zup"" correlates to yellow.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and there are three instances of blue in the output.

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output shows ""yellow yellow yellow."" Following this pattern, ""walm"" causes the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) to be repeated three times.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output has ""red"" repeated three times, indicating ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with ""wif"" (red).

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- In the final example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red,"" which again shows that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""wif"" (red).

Rule:
walm -> causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times.

If ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue""; if it follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green""; if it follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red""; and if it follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""",-4.206202380138,167,walm
"According to the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to replicate the previous color that was stated. Here is the justification:

- In the first example, ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" The ""walm"" that follows ""lug"" turns into ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue.""

- The third input, ""lug zup walm lug,"" has ""lug"" translating to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" In this sequence, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it becomes ""yellow,"" and the final ""lug"" is ""blue.""

- In the fourth and fifth examples ""wif walm zup"" and ""dax wif walm,"" once again, ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Therefore, based on the examples, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the previous word.

"Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" appears to translate consistently to the color blue, as every instance of ""lug"" in the inputs corresponds to ""blue"" in the outputs. To confirm this:

- In the first example, ""lug"" falls between ""walm"" (associated with yellow) and ""zup"" (also associated with yellow) and outputs ""blue.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup wif"" (which translates to yellow red) and precedes with ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, the presence of ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the outputs, no matter its position or surrounding words.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns in the given input-output pairs, focusing on the presence of ""bluf"" and the colors in the output.

- In the first input, ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" corresponds to ""blue red blue green green."" ""Bluf"" comes after ""dax,"" which seems to map to ""green,"" and there are two greens in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow."" ""Bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""zup."" ""Dax"" is followed by ""green,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be followed by another ""green."" ""Zup"" maps to ""yellow.""
- In the third input, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red."" Here, ""wif"" seems to map to ""red,"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also results in a ""red"" in the output.
- In the fourth input, ""wif bluf"" gives ""red red."" It's similar to the previous case, where ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" both leading to ""red.""
- The fifth input, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" yields ""red red red blue blue."" The first ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which we don't have any additional information about, but it also leads to ""red."" ""Lug"" maps to ""blue,"" followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another ""blue.""

Considering the information above, we can infer that ""bluf"" directly repeats the color mapped by the word that precedes it in the sequence (if there's a directly mapped color to that word). If ""bluf"" follows:

- ""dax"" (green), the result is ""green""
- ""wif"" (red), the result is ""red""
- ""lug"" (blue), the result is ""blue""

There's no clear result after ""walm,"" as we don't have an established mapping for that word. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

bluf -> meaning. ""Bluf"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. 
Rule: If a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" then the color that the word represents is repeated in the output.",-1.0204845545799999,168,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""two consecutive colors that are the same as the previous color mentioned in the input.""

For instance:

- In the first input, ""lug dax bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Bluf"" then means the color green repeated twice.
- In the second input, ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green. Therefore, ""bluf"" means green repeated twice.
- In the fourth input, ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red. Consequently, ""bluf"" means red repeated twice.

Bluf -> two instances of the color just before it in the sequence.",-5.086111118260001,168,bluf
"bluf -> doubling the last color mentioned. Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is the last color mentioned, repeated once. If ""bluf"" appears at the end of the input sequence, the last color word before ""bluf"" is outputted twice.",-8.994383251839999,168,bluf

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the immediately preceding word.,-9.270039298380002,168,bluf
"walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates that the previous color word's output should be repeated three times. For instance, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", then ""wif walm"" would correspond to ""red red red"". Here's the interpretation for each input phrase:

- ""wif"" is followed by ""zup"" and then ""walm"" which results in ""red yellow yellow yellow"", meaning ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" to repeat three times after ""zup"".
- ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" which results in ""green green green"", so ""walm"" causes the ""green"" to repeat three times after ""dax"".
- ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"", which results in ""blue blue blue"", meaning ""walm"" causes the ""blue"" to repeat three times after ""lug"".
- In the input ""dax walm wif walm zup"", the presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times, and its subsequent appearance after ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being repeated three times before the sequence ends with a ""yellow"" for ""zup"".
- Lastly, ""lug walm"" without any following color term simply results in a triple ""blue"" output.

Thus, the rule is that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word directly preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.",-5.067465436499999,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", we need to analyze the patterns in the provided examples.

- In the first example, the appearance of ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow"" being outputted three times.
- In the second example, we again see ""walm"" correlating with ""yellow"" being outputted three times, but here ""dax"" precedes it, resulting in ""green"" appearing twice before the ""yellow"" sequence.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" three times, and ""walm"" follows, again correlating to ""blue"" being outputted three times.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" three times, and two instances of ""walm"" each lead to ""red"" being outputted three times before a single ""yellow"" at the end.
- In the last example, ""lug walm"" correlates with ""blue"" being outputted three times.

The consistent pattern is that ""walm"" causes the color previously associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times. Additionally, the pattern shows that the color association is specific to the preceding word: ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" There is no instance where ""walm"" stands alone without a preceding word, so it's unclear what the output would be without that context.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be outputted three times. 

Walm -> causes triple repetition of the previous color association.",-6.469202944402001,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"", let's analyze the outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

1. In the first input, the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to three consecutive ""yellow"" in the output.
2. The second input also shows ""walm"" associated with three ""yellow"" in sequence before any other word interrupts.
3. The third input illustrates that ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"", which suggests that the color depends on the word before ""walm"".
4. In the fourth input, the presence of ""walm"" results in three repeated colors: when preceded by ""dax"", it results in ""green green green"", and when preceded by ""wif"", it results in ""red red red"".
5. The fifth input shows ""walm"" at the end and corresponds to three ""blue"" in the output.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" represents a rule where its presence causes the next three outputs to be the same color. The color itself is dependent on the word before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""lug"", the color is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color is green, and if it follows ""wif"", the color is red.

Rule: walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word or follows ""lug"", the associated color is blue. If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color is green. If ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color is red.",-8.148072971272,168,walm
"By examining the patterns where the word ""walm"" occurs and the colors associated with ""walm"" and other words in the sequence, we can deduce the following:

1. In each example, ""walm"" is associated with three consecutive color outputs.
2. The color that is repeated three times does not appear to be related to the word ""walm"" directly, but rather to the word that immediately precedes ""walm.""
3. Based on the colors given in the outputs, the immediate preceding word to ""walm"" seems to have its color repeated thrice. For example, when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times. When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""green"" is repeated three times. And when ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the color ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Given the observations above, we can induce that ""walm"" acts as a multiplier or extender to the color associated with the word that comes before it.

Rule: walm -> Triplicates the color value associated with the immediately preceding word.",-9.314034944140001,168,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's examine each instance of ""walm"" and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup 
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
   After ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the two previous colors, ""yellow"" and ""green."" 

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow 

   After ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the previous color, ""green.""
   
3. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

   After ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the previous color, ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow 

   After ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the previous color, ""green,"" and then after the second ""walm,"" the sequence of colors repeats the previous color, ""red.""

5. Input: lug walm 
   Output: blue blue blue

   After ""walm,"" the output is simply repetitions of the color ""blue.""

From these examples, it appears that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated three times. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Here's the word-to-color mapping based on the given outputs:

- walm -> red
- wif -> red
- bluf -> red 
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue

Now, let's see how ""dax"" fits in:

1. Input: ""dax walm wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""green green green red red"" 
   The two repeated words ""walm"" and ""wif"" both map to ""red,"" and since ""dax"" is the first word, it must correspond to the first color, which is ""green.""

2. Input: ""zup lug dax lug"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue green blue"" 
   ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" maps to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" comes before the third color, which is ""green.""

3. Input: ""wif bluf dax"" 
   Output: ""red red green"" 
   Both ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red,"" and ""dax"" precedes the color ""green.""

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" 
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""

5. Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" 
   Output: ""blue red blue green green""

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" 

Therefore, dax -> green.",-0.393858344126,169,dax
"Analyzing the examples:

1. In the first example, dax corresponds with green, which is at the beginning of the output sequence.
2. In the second example, dax also corresponds with green, but in this instance, it is surrounded by two blue (lug) and one yellow (zup), suggesting it does not depend on position or surrounding words.
3. In the third example, dax is again associated with green and at the end, confirming it does not depend on position.
4. In the fourth example, dax is at the beginning, followed by a red (wif), then a series of reds and yellows. Despite the difference in surrounding words, dax still corresponds to green.
5. In the fifth example, dax is in the middle and corresponds to green, regardless of being surrounded by different color words.

"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I'll analyze the examples and try to find consistent patterns.

Analyzing the first example:
- Input: wif bluf
- Output: red red

We can see that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" since it's repeated in the output.

Considering the second example:
- Input: wif bluf dax
- Output: red red green

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both still correspond to ""red"".

Now, examining the third example:
- Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
- Output: blue green green red green

We can notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is again matched with ""red"".

Looking at the fourth example:
- Input: lug wif lug bluf
- Output: blue red blue blue

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" matches with ""blue."" This is the first example where ""bluf"" does not correspond to ""red"".

Lastly, the fifth example:
- Input: lug bluf
- Output: blue blue

In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

Based on the third and fourth examples, it appears that ""bluf"" doesn't have a fixed color meaning but rather takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the patterns with respect to the corresponding outputs:

1. In the first example, every ""dax"" maps to ""green"" and every ""lug"" maps to ""blue"". ""Walm"" seems to map to ""blue"" as well, but it may be because it's repeated twice.

2. In the second example, ""dax"" again maps to ""green"". While the single ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""yellow"" followed by ""blue"", it seems ""walm"" continues to give multiple ""blue"" outputs.

3. In the third example, ""zup"" only appears once and maps to ""yellow"", while ""dax"" once again maps to ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, we see that ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" to ""green"". Now the new word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

5. In the fifth example, the pattern continues with ""wif"" mapping to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

From these examples, we can deduce ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"". It does not depend on the context of its placement or how many times it appears.

Rule: dax -> green.",-5.119434741698,170,dax
"Based on the examples provided, we can induce that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Looking at the consistent presentation of ""dax"" and what follows in the output across all examples:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the output.
2. ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" in the output after ""dax.""
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, but if it appears right after ""dax,"" it is preceded by ""green green"" as seen in the second example.
4. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position relative to ""dax.""
5. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output, and its placement relative to ""dax"" does not change this correspondence.

Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green""

Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the inputs is consistently translated to the word ""green"" in the outputs.",-5.40859169676,170,dax
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning of ""dax"" by looking at the consistent output it triggers in various contexts.

Input: dax lug dax lug walm 
Output: green blue green blue blue blue 
- ""lug"" always results in ""blue"".
- ""walm"" appears at the end of the input and yields double ""blue"" (""blue blue"").

Input: dax walm zup lug walm 
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue 
- ""walm"" not at the end still yields ""green"".
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" at the end yields double ""blue"" again.

- In every instance ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is in the same position in the output sequence.
- No other word consistently results in the output ""green"".

From these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup', we must look for patterns in the given examples. Each example consists of the word 'zup' followed by other words, and the corresponding output is a series of color names. By examining what follows 'zup' and the corresponding colors that appear in the output, we can attempt to figure out the rule that 'zup' is following.

In every example where 'zup' appears, 'yellow' appears in the output:

- Input: zup wif lug -> Output: yellow red blue
- Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug -> Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red
- Input: zup dax wif zup -> Output: yellow green red yellow

Regardless of what word follows 'zup', the word 'yellow' always appears in the corresponding output. In addition, 'yellow' only appears when 'zup' is present in the input. This persistent pairing suggests that there is a direct relationship between 'zup' and the color 'yellow'.

Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word 'zup' as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-9.0925599887,170,zup
"Based on the given examples, we can infer the following color-coded word pairs:

- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue

In each instance, when ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color of the word that directly precedes it. Here's a breakdown of the evidence:

- In the first input ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""
- In the second input ""zup dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""
- In the third input ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

- In the fifth input ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""green.""

According to these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to replicate the color of the preceding word.",-4.54979820196,170,bluf
"Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the preceding word. If there is no preceding word, ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"". Here is the pattern:

- If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red"".
- If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is the same as the preceding word, thus ""yellow"".
- If ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green"".
- If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", it seems that we don't have an example for that, but we might infer that ""bluf"" would follow the color associated with ""lug"", which is ""blue"". However, the output from ""lug dax bluf"" deviates from this pattern, resulting in ""blue green green"" instead of ""blue blue blue"", so we cannot confirm that without more examples.

Therefore, bluf -> the same color as the output for the preceding word except when ""wif"" precedes it, which results in ""red"". If there is no word before ""bluf,"" it defaults to ""yellow"".",-5.3734820663,170,bluf

- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three additional times.
  
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again causes the previous color to be repeated two additional times.

- For ""lug walm wif bluf,"" the word ""lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue blue blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" with ""bluf"" being an additional ""red."" So, ""walm"" causes ""lug""'s color (blue) to repeat three times.

- With ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated two additional times.

- In ""zup walm lug wif bluf,"" ""zup"" (yellow) followed by ""walm"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow,"" then ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" (red), and ""bluf"" (red) show that ""walm"" does not affect colors mentioned after it, only the one immediately before it.

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to involve repeating the color associated with the word prior to ""walm"" multiple times in the output. Observing each example:

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" produces ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"", where ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (assigned red) and ""lug"" (assigned blue) and then the color repeats three times after each respective occurrence.
- ""dax lug walm"" yields ""green blue blue blue"", where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and blue is repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"", which indicates that ""lug"" (blue) is followed by three repetitions of blue.
- ""zup walm wif"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""zup"" comes before ""walm"" and yellow is repeated three times before switching to the color associated with ""wif"" (red).
- ""dax walm lug"" translates to ""green green green blue"", where ""dax"" (green) precedes ""walm"" and the resulting color green is repeated three times before switching to the color associated with ""lug"" (blue).

"walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color that comes before it to repeat for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one. For instance:

- In the first example, ""walm lug zup walm,"" ""lug"" (blue) is repeated three times because ""walm"" occurs twice after it. The ""zup"" (yellow) is then repeated three times because there's one ""walm"" after it.
- In the second example, ""walm"" appears once after ""lug"" (blue), so ""blue"" is repeated a total of twice.
- The third and fourth examples follow the same pattern where the color before ""walm"" repeats for the number of times ""walm"" appears plus one.
- The last example, ""dax walm lug,"" suggests that when ""walm"" is proceeded by two colors (like ""dax"" for green and ""lug"" for blue), the immediate previous color (""dax"" in this case) is the one that gets repeated.",-6.95432768311,171,walm
"Based on the presented examples, the rule for the nonce word 'walm' seems to be that the word 'walm' causes the following word to repeat the color associated with it. The examples show that when 'walm' appears, the color corresponding to the next word is repeated once if 'walm' appears once, and twice if 'walm' appears twice.

Here's the breakdown of the rule based on each input:

- In the first input, ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow is repeated because of the two instances of 'walm' following it. The same goes for ""lug"" which corresponds to blue and is repeated for the same reason.
- In the second input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and repeats three times because 'walm' appears once right after.
- In the third input, without another word to follow 'walm', ""lug"" still corresponds to blue and repeats three times, suggesting the same rule applies even if 'walm' is at the end.
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" again corresponds to yellow and repeats twice because 'walm' appears once before it, and ""wif"" which corresponds to red is not repeated because it follows without 'walm'.
- In the fifth input, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and repeats once because 'walm' appears once before it.

Therefore, the rule could be stated as:

Rule: When 'walm' precedes a word, the color associated with the following word is repeated as many times as 'walm' appears consecutively before it. If 'walm' is the last word, the repetition rule applies to the word preceding 'walm' instead.

Walm -> Causes the color of the next word to repeat an additional time per occurrence of 'walm'. If 'walm' is the last word, it causes the color of the previous word to repeat.",-7.109035531757999,171,walm

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
- ""dax"" only appears once and is translated to ""green"".
- ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"", and seems to be a repeating element based on its repetition in ""lug wif dax zup walm"". 
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and is also translated to ""yellow"", which could indicate it repeats the prior color or is specifically ""yellow"". With the available data, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.
- ""bluf"" appears in the context following ""wif"" and translates to ""red"". It is unclear if ""bluf"" has its own distinct color or if it is simply repeating the color associated with ""wif"". The examples are not sufficient to deduce a stand-alone meaning for ""bluf"".",-3.052604114148,172,lug
"Based on the given examples, here are the observations:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears on its own, the output is ""blue"". This suggests that ""lug"" translates directly to ""blue"".

2. When ""lug"" is followed by other nonce words like ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""bluf"", there is a corresponding change in the output color sequence. ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to ""red"".

3. The other nonce words such as ""dax"", ""zup"" and ""walm"" appear to have consistent color translations too. ""dax"" results in ""green"", ""zup"" leads to one occurrence of ""yellow"", and ""walm"" results in three occurrences of ""yellow"".

4. In the context of repeating nonce words, such as ""bluf"", the output is ""red"", which might indicate that repeating nonsense words, or maybe words that share some phonetic or letter pattern with ""wif"" (e.g., ending with 'f'), are also contributing to the ""red"" output.

The rule that can be deduced is as follows:

lug -> ""blue""

Additionally:

wif -> ""red""
dax -> ""green""
zup -> ""yellow""
walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (walm appears to equate to a triplet of the color yellow)
bluf -> ""red"" (assuming ""bluf"" follows the pattern of ending with 'f' being translated to ""red"")

- ""walm"" is consistently followed by three instances of the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is consistently followed by instances of the color blue.
- ""zup"" is consistently followed by an instance of the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word is associated with a specific color. The color is repeated depending on the word: ""walm"" repeats the color three times, ""lug"" maintains the quantity of the color as it appears in the input, and ""zup"" signifies the color once.

"From the given examples, we can attempt to induce the rule governing the use of the nonce word ""zup."" To do this, we must look for a pattern across all examples where ""zup"" is present and its corresponding outputs.

In the first example ""Input: zup dax"" corresponds to ""Output: yellow green."" The word ""zup"" corresponds to the first color ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to the second color ""green."" 

Taking the second example ""Input: zup wif lug"" which corresponds to ""Output: yellow red blue,"" we see that ""zup"" is again tied to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is tied to ""red,"" and ""lug"" is tied to ""blue.""

With the third example ""Input: zup bluf dax,"" corresponding to ""Output: yellow yellow green,"" we can deduce that ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" now corresponds to ""yellow"" too, and ""dax"" remains tied to ""green.""

In the fourth example ""Input: lug zup lug,"" corresponding to ""Output: blue yellow blue,"" the position of ""zup"" has moved but it still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

The final example shows a lengthy sequence, but the pattern of colors is consistent with the previous examples for the words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax."" 

Considering all five examples, the consistent rule that we can deduce is that the nonce word ""zup"" invariably corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" no matter its position in the sequence. Thus:

Rule: zup -> yellow",-5.474672698288889,172,zup

- 'zup' doesn't change its corresponding output ('yellow') regardless of its position in the input.
- Other words in the input correspond to different colors in the output, suggesting they have their own meanings, but 'zup' consistently maps to 'yellow'.

"To determine the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to examine each of the examples provided and look for patterns in their outputs. Let's consider each input and the corresponding output to look for such patterns.

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax

Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""dax"" and before ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.

Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
Output: red blue blue red yellow
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""lug,"" which is blue.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""wif,"" which is red.

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue
Analysis: When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
Analysis: This input is similar to the second one where ""bluf"" appears after ""lug,"" and again ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as ""lug,"" blue.

Looking at the patterns, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it. There is, however, one exception in the first input, where ""dax bluf wif"" results in ""green red yellow,"" but this could be because ""bluf"" is influenced by the word that immediately follows it in cases where ""bluf"" doesn't result in the same color as the previous word.

In the first example, ""bluf"" occurs between ""wif"" and ""zup"" and the output colors are red and yellow, respectively (with an additional green at the end corresponding to ""dax"").
In the second example, ""bluf"" is again between ""lug"" and ""wif"", with corresponding output colors being blue and red.
The third example shows ""bluf"" following ""wif"" with red preceding it in the output.
The fourth example has ""bluf"" following ""zup"" with the same color, yellow, preceding it.

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is red; when ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is yellow; and when ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color is blue.

"Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" appears to be a word that represents repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The number of repetitions is equal to the number of times the color has appeared so far plus one. Here's how the rule applies in each of the given examples:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which means ""green"". ""Green"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in green being repeated two more times (for a total of three greens).

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif"", which means ""red"". ""Red"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in red being repeated two more times (for a total of three reds).

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"". ""Yellow"" has not appeared before in this sequence, so ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two times (for a total of three yellows).

4. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
   Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
   The first ""walm"" follows the second ""lug"", which means ""blue"". ""Blue"" has appeared twice, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated three more times (for a total of five blues).
   The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which means ""yellow"". ""Yellow"" has not appeared before in this sequence, so ""walm"" results in yellow being repeated two more times (for a total of three yellows).

5. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   The first ""walm"" follows ""lug"", which means ""blue"". ""Blue"" has appeared once, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated two more times (for a total of three blues).
   The second ""walm"" follows the second ""lug"", which means ""blue"" again. ""Blue"" has appeared four times before this point, so ""walm"" results in blue being repeated five more times (for a total of nine blues, but the sequence stops at the seventh appearance).

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word, and do it the number of times it has appeared so far plus one.",-6.737361871786,172,walm
"walm -> repeating the color of the word before ""walm"" multiple times based on a contextual rule.

Rule:
When 'walm' follows a color word (represented by 'lug', 'zup', or 'dax'), it causes the output to repeat the color denoted by the word before 'walm' as many times as the positional value of the word before 'walm' in the sequence. For instance, 'dax' is green, and when 'walm' comes after 'dax', the result is ""green red red red,"" with 'red' signifying an effect of 'walm'. The positional value of 'dax' is 1 (as it's the first color word in ""dax wif walm""), and thus 'green' is repeated one additional time for a total of two instances, followed by 'red' to denote each repeated occurrence.

In ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" 'lug' occurs twice before 'walm', denoting that 'blue' should be repeated twice, but 'walm' appears after the second occurrence of 'lug', hence it is repeated two times for a positional value of 2. The same principle applies to 'zup walm', which follows this pattern accordingly. 

This rule is supported by the fact that ""lug walm zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue"" where 'lug' precedes 'walm' in two separate instances. Each instance causes the color 'blue' to repeat based on its sequence position. Since 'lug' is the first word before 'walm', 'blue' is repeated twice, and for the second occurrence of 'lug' before 'walm' since it's the first word in the sequence again, 'blue' is repeated twice more.",-8.926856430319999,172,walm

"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it, resulting in a sequence of that color.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is two additional ""yellow"" words after ""zup,"" which implies ""walm"" might mean to repeat the last color mentioned, which is ""yellow"" here.
  
- In the second example, ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Once again, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), and two more ""yellow"" is the output, consistent with the first example's rule.
  
- In the third example, ""wif walm zup,"" the ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), resulting in ""red red red,"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats ""red"" two more times.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" showing that ""walm"" repeats ""lug"" (blue) two more times.

- Finally, in the fifth example ""wif walm dax zup,"" the ""walm"" is after ""wif"" (red), and results in ""red red red"" before the pattern continues with ""green yellow"" for ""dax zup.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it repeats the color of the word preceding it, duplicating it two more times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times.",-3.0730859476259997,173,walm
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the output by repeating the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times.

Let's break down each example to see the pattern:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow."" It results in three ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - Same as above, ""walm"" comes after the second ""zup"" and results in three ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and thus ""walm"" results in three ""red.""

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" resulting in three ""blue.""

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three ""red.""

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it three times.",-5.020432746358,173,walm
"Based on the examples given, the word ""walm"" appears to result in the output repeating the color of the word that precedes ""walm"". Here is the rule based on the given examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. After ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", which is a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", which corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"", again indicating a repetition of the yellow.
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red"" (repeating the color for ""wif"").
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", corresponding to the color blue, and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue blue"" (repeating the color for ""lug"").
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", and the output after ""walm"" is ""red red"" (repeating the color red for ""wif""), and not repeating ""dax"" which is green following ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: walm -> The output color will repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"".",-6.8017901597999995,173,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should focus on the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Analyzing the outputs, it seems that each word in the input is translated into a color in the output. Additionally, it appears that ""walm"" does not correspond to a new color but instead repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input. Let's confirm this by looking at the given examples:

1. In the first input, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs as ""yellow."" The output for ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"" (three times).
2. In the second input, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, with the same pattern of outputting ""yellow yellow yellow.""
3. In the third input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red"" (three times).
4. In the fourth input, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue"" (three times).
5. In the fifth input, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red red"" again.

Regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence or the other words around it, its output is always ""red."" Additionally, other words in the inputs seem to correspond to specific colors: for example, ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" and ""dax"" always translates to ""green.""

Input 2:
- zup wif -> yellow red

Input 3:
- zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue

Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" which has so far translated to ""yellow"", and then by ""lug"", which translates to ""blue"".

- lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red

In this sequence, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by another ""wif"" (red), and it translates to ""yellow"".

- Whenever ""zup"" appears in a sequence, the word that follows it generates a color that is identical to the color generated by ""zup"" itself.

2. dax wif bluf -> green red red
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
4. wif bluf zup -> red red yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

It appears that the output is a sequence of colors ""green,"" ""yellow,"" or ""red"" that relate to the sequence of input words. The word ""bluf"" consistently results in ""green"" when it follows ""dax"" and ""yellow"" when it either precedes ""dax,"" follows ""zup"" or is immediately preceded by ""zup.""

It's possible that the meaning of ""bluf"" itself may vary depending on the word that comes before or after it in these examples. Nonetheless, the consistent rule we can establish is related to the positional context of ""bluf"" with respect to other words.

Therefore:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided.

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf zup"" corresponds to ""green green yellow"". The word ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and is associated with green, and ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and is associated with yellow.

2. The second example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"". Here, ""dax"" is associated with green again, but ""wif"" is before ""bluf"" this time and is associated with red.

3. In the third example, ""zup bluf dax"" results in ""yellow yellow green"". ""Zup"" is before ""bluf"" and both are associated with yellow, followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

4. The fourth example, ""wif bluf zup"" translates to ""red red yellow"". ""Wif"" is again associated with red and comes before ""bluf"", which also gets red, followed by ""zup"" which is associated with yellow.

5. Lastly, ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow"". ""Zup"" is before ""bluf"" and both are associated with yellow.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rules about the meanings:
- The color associated with ""bluf"" seems to depend on what word is right in front of it.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the color green is associated with ""bluf"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the color red is associated with ""bluf"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the color yellow is associated with ""bluf"".

"bluf -> meaning. Rule: Based on the output colors which appear to reflect a pattern similar to the game ""Mastermind,"" where green might indicate the correct element in the correct position, yellow the correct element in the wrong position, and red an incorrect element, we can infer for the word ""bluf."" Given that in each instance where ""bluf"" is used, the corresponding output is either yellow or green, but never red, it seems that ""bluf"" refers to an element present in the input sequence. Also, its correct position seems to change:

1. When ""bluf"" is in the second position, and ""dax"" is in the first, ""bluf"" corresponds to green (correct element in the correct place).
2. When ""bluf"" is in the first position, the output is yellow no matter if ""dax"" or ""zup"" follow, suggesting that ""bluf"" might be correct but in the wrong position.

Considering these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" might correctly correspond to the second position in the sequence when ""dax"" is in the first or it could mean that ""bluf"" is the word ""dax"" in the correct position, and ""zup"" is the word that matches with ""bluf"" but in the incorrect position. The output does not provide a clear rule for the cases with ""wif,"" as it's consistently red when adjacent to ""bluf."" So, based on the given examples, the most consistent rule that could be applied is:

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the word ""dax"" when ""dax"" is in the correct position, or to the word that is in the incorrect position (not ""wif"").",-4.35175646976,174,bluf

2. dax wif bluf -> red red
3. zup bluf dax -> yellow green
4. wif bluf zup -> red yellow

The output associated with ""bluf"" changes in each example, so there's no consistent pattern that can be deduced solely based on the word ""bluf"" itself. Therefore, we may need more information or further examples to definitively determine the meaning of ""bluf."" However, with the examples given, the output when ""bluf"" appears could possibly be related to the position of the word relative to the other words, or it might be affected by the preceding and following words in a way that isn't immediately obvious with the given data.

Given only the examples above, we cannot define a clear and consistent rule for the meaning of ""bluf."" Thus, the best I can provide with the current information is:

bluf -> meaning: The meaning of ""bluf"" cannot be determined from the provided examples as there is no consistent rule or pattern in the output.

Rule: Indeterminable based on the given examples.",-4.69227169476,174,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must look for patterns in the input and output pairs. Let's examine them side-by-side.

1. Input: dax bluf zup           Output: green green yellow
2. Input: dax wif bluf           Output: green red red
3. Input: zup bluf dax           Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: wif bluf zup           Output: red red yellow
5. Input: zup bluf               Output: yellow yellow

In the given examples, the output colors seem to correspond to the input words' positions or their specific characteristics, rather than any inherent quality of the individual words. Here are a few key observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears first in the input, the first output is green; if ""dax"" appears in the last position, the last output is green.
- The word ""zup"" is correlated with yellow in the output, whether it is in the middle or end position, as we can see comparing inputs 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- The word ""wif"" is correlated with red when it appears, as seen in inputs 2 and 4.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" might be related to the position of the word as well. Notably, in every output where ""bluf"" was second, the second place is green, and in each instance where ""bluf"" was first, the first output is red. However, there is an exception in input 3 where ""bluf"" results in yellow when followed by ""dax.""

Given the absence of a consistent pattern related solely to the position of ""bluf,"" it might indicate that ""bluf"" adopts a color different from the colors tied directly to other words like ""dax"" or ""wif."" However, without a clearer pattern or additional examples, it's challenging to determine a definitive rule.

We could consider that ""bluf"" takes on the color that is not represented by the adjacent words, creating a sequence of different colors, but this hypothesis breaks down with input 2, where ""bluf"" results in a red even though ""wif"" directly before it also results in a red.

With the given data:

Rule: bluf seems to correspond to green when it is in the middle position of the input string; it shows yellow when it follows ""zup,"" and red when it precedes ""dax."" The rule is inconsistent, however, therefore a firm rule for ""bluf"" cannot be concluded without more information.",-4.981018857059999,174,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and corresponding outputs. 

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, one color appears repeatedly in the output thereafter.
2. The color that repeats corresponds to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

Here are the examples mapping inputs to outputs:

- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> red red green green green
- ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""lug walm dax"" -> blue blue blue green
- ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow

From these examples, we can infer:
- After ""wif bluf dax walm,"" the color green is repeated three times.
- After ""zup walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times.
- After ""zup lug zup walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times following ""walm.""
- After ""lug walm,"" the color blue is repeated three times.
- After ""wif walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the next color to be repeated thrice. We can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.",-1.3111500926399997,174,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the patterns before and after the word in each example:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow

Analysis of the examples reveals the following patterns:

- In every instance, the color that appears after ""walm"" is green.
- The color output immediately before ""walm"" is the repeated color which varies with each example (red, yellow, blue).

Based on this repeated color before ""walm"" and the consistent appearance of green after it, it appears that ""walm"" causes the continuation of the preceding color and then changes it to green:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word, then change to green.

However, this rule fails to explain why ""walm"" outputs multiple identical colors (as in examples 1, 3, and 5) when it is not the first word in the input sequence. Looking closer at these instances, the colors repeat a number of times equal to the number of preceding words before ""walm"" is said. This suggests a more complex rule where ""walm"" outputs the color of the preceding word times the total number of words before ""walm,"" then changes to green. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as there are words before ""walm,"" then change to green.",-1.348368563088,174,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

Looking at the sequences, we can note the following:

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two instances of green.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by yellow. However, there is no clear indication yet of what ""walm"" means because ""zup"" itself translates to yellow.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- ""walm"" here translates to a single yellow. Note that ""lug"" translates to blue, and ""dax"" translates to green, and ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both translate to red.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and is followed by blue again before ""dax"" (green).

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) and is followed by red again before ""dax"" (green), then followed by ""zup"" (yellow).

From the above, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it. Each instance of ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the previous color. Therefore, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

Hence, the color output for ""walm"" depends on the preceding word's assigned color: ""lug"" (blue), ""zup"" (yellow), or ""wif"" (red). ""walm"" repeats this preceding color. When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) the output is additional green as seen in the first input-output pairing, this can be considered an exception or special rule related to the combination of ""dax walm"" specifically.",-6.494722545450001,174,walm

3. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
4. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
5. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow

By observing the pattern, let's check the color sequence following ""walm"" in each output:

1. After ""walm"": green green
2. After ""walm"": yellow
3. After ""walm"": yellow green
4. After ""walm"": blue green
5. After ""walm"": red green yellow (we can ignore ""yellow"" as it corresponds to ""zup,"" which comes after ""walm"")

Every time the word ""walm"" appears, ""green"" is always in the next position in the output. The color that appears before ""green"" seems to correspond to the last word before ""walm."" Looking closely:

- ""dax walm"": green follows
- ""lug walm"": blue precedes green
- ""wif walm"": red precedes green

The consistency is that ""walm"" is directly followed by ""green"" in the output sequence. The color preceding ""green"" is presumably determined by the word immediately before ""walm."" 

This suggests:
""lug"" -> blue
""dax"" -> green
""zup"" -> yellow
""wif"" -> red
""bluf"" -> red

Based on the pattern observed, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word, followed by green.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the preceding word, followed by green.",-8.392332756220002,174,walm
"Rule: walm seems to represent a color that matches the color of the word that appears before it. If no color word precedes walm, it defaults to yellow.

Explanation:
- In the first input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green"" which corresponds to ""dax"".
- In the second input, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" but ""zup"" is not followed by a specific color, so ""walm"" defaults to ""yellow"".
- In the third input, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"", so ""walm"" outputs ""blue blue"".
- In the fourth input, the pattern continues with ""lug"" before ""walm"", so ""walm"" is blue, and after ""dax,"" it turns green.
- In the fifth input, ""wif"" before ""walm"" gives red, and ""dax"" after ""walm"" turns it to green, followed by ""zup"" making it yellow.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we need to look at the provided examples and identify any patterns or consistent occurrences that correlate with the input and output sequences. Here's what we have:

1. ""dax walm wif dax"" corresponds to ""green green green red green""
2. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
3. ""dax walm wif"" corresponds to ""green green green red""
4. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""
5. ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green""

Looking at the outputs, the word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green,"" except in one instance where ""dax"" is at the end of the sequence, it correlates with ""red."" However, there is not enough data to conclude that ""dax"" at the end always corresponds to ""red,"" because there is only one instance of this, and it could be another word in the sequence that triggers the ""red"" output (e.g., ""wif""). More data would be needed to support this pattern.

From what we can consistently observe, ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""

Rule:
dax -> green",-1.170930831688,175,dax
"Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone, the output is a single ""green.""
Whenever the word ""dax"" is followed by other words (""walm wif dax"" or ""walm wif""), a pattern of ""green"" is preserved for every instance of ""dax,"" while the other words generate a pattern of ""green green red"" regardless of the presence of another ""dax.""

No matter what words follow ""dax"" or if ""dax"" appears more than once, each occurrence of ""dax"" itself is correlated with the word ""green"" in the output. There are no examples that show a violation of this rule. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.",-3.25716200706,175,dax
"Based on the data provided, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the word ""dax."" Let's analyze the patterns:

1. Whenever we see the word ""dax,"" it appears that the output is ""green.""
2. In the one instance where ""dax"" is followed by additional words (""walm wif""), the output begins with ""green"" but has a ""red"" before returning to ""green.""

From these observations, we can infer that the presence of the word ""dax"" alone corresponds to the output ""green."" However, the additional context provided by ""walm wif"" does not seem to change the output associated with ""dax"" but introduces a ""red"" before continuing the sequence of ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" -> green

This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" but without additional context or examples, it is not completely clear what causes the ""red"" output in the sequence. If ""red"" is consistently associated with certain conditions or words, this rule may require modification.

"The provided examples show a pattern where the output consistently has ""green"" corresponding to each occurrence of the word ""dax"". No other words are consistently paired with a specific color in the outputs, and the extra non-""dax"" words (""walm"" and ""wif"") are present only once each, which makes it difficult to deduce their meanings or effects based on the given data.

However, ""dax"" seems to be directly and consistently linked to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position or the presence of other words.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""lug,"" which result in two additional repetitions of ""yellow."" Following those, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" Perhaps ""lug"" indicates the repetition of the color that comes before it.

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - Again, ""walm"" after ""zup"" seems to cause a repetition of ""yellow.""

4. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" suggesting that it's not influenced by ""zup."" ""zup"" remains ""yellow."" ""wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" gives ""blue."" ""lug"" does not cause a repetition of ""blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" repeats the previous color only when it follows ""walm.""

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which again causes a repetition, this time of ""blue."" The placement of ""lug"" and ""walm"" seems significant in determining repetition.

Based on this analysis, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow."" Additionally, ""walm"" following ""zup"" results in repetition, and ""lug"" repeats the previous color, but only when it follows ""walm.""

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""",-6.431792165045001,175,zup

From these examples, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". However, for the other words, there seems to be inconsistency with ""walm"", which corresponds to ""yellow"" in two instances and ""blue"" in another.

"Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf."" To confirm this, we look at each example:

- The second input is ""dax bluf"" with the same ""green green"" output, confirming the earlier observation.
- The third input is ""lug bluf,"" which results in ""blue blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fourth example, ""wif zup bluf"" yields ""red yellow yellow."" Here ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and repeats its color, yellow.
- Finally, the fifth input, ""wif bluf dax,"" creates an output of ""red red green."" ""Bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and before ""dax,"" and it repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is red.

- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue"" for the same reason, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"".
- ""wif zup bluf"" results in ""red yellow yellow"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""yellow"".
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green"", with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""red"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

"Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color, giving another green.
- In the second example, there is only ""dax"" before ""bluf,"" and as observed before, ""dax"" is associated with green. Thus, ""bluf"" repeats the green.
- In the third example, ""lug"" is a new word, but given that the output is blue blue, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and the output is yellow yellow, indicating that ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- In the first input ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" outputs a single ""blue,"" and then the ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" outputs a single ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces three repetitions of ""yellow.""
- Similarly, for ""zup walm lug,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated three times due to ""walm,"" and then ""lug"" adds one ""blue"" to the output.

"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to be a repetition of the corresponding color for the word preceding it. Each word (lug, zup, etc.) seems to be associated with a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

When the word ""walm"" follows these words, the output is the corresponding color repeated three times. It seems to work as a command for repetition. Additionally, in the case where multiple color-related words are used before and after ""walm,"" the repetition applies only to the immediate word preceding ""walm"":

- Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue (Repetition of ""blue"")
- Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue (Repetition of ""yellow"", then one ""blue"")

Consider the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-related word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by another color-related word, then that word is translated into its color once without repetition.

"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a specific color. The color is repeated three times in a row immediately following the use of the word ""walm"":

- In ""lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" which suggests that ""lug walm"" might mean three blues.
- In ""zup walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""zup walm"" equates to three yellows.
- When ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and ""lug"" in ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" again reinforcing the repetition rule and indicating that other non-""walm"" words translate to different single colors (here, ""lug"" seems to translate to ""blue"").
- In ""lug walm zup walm,"" the output features both ""blue blue blue"" and ""yellow yellow yellow"" in the correct order, suggesting that the rule for ""walm"" remains consistent even with other color words in between.

However, the examples also suggest that ""walm"" might not hold meaning by itself but might depend on the word that comes before it. This is supported by how the color changes when a different word precedes ""walm"":

- ""lug walm"" leads to blues while ""zup walm"" leads to yellows. 
- In the example without ""walm,"" ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" we see individual colors after each word, suggesting that ""dax"" and ""wif"" correspond to their own colors too.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before walm three times.",-1.0871362420819999,176,walm
"Considering the provided examples, we can deduce a pattern regarding the color output associated with the term ""walm"" and the words preceding it. Let's look at each instance:

1. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""blue.""

2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""blue.""

3. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""green.""

5. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - Here, ""walm"" corresponds to two occurrences of ""red.""

Based on these examples, we can conclude that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be repeated, but the number of repetitions may vary.

Let's examine the evidence for the number of repetitions:

- In the first two examples, ""walm"" comes after ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and results in three consecutive ""blue"" results.
- In the third example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" again, but this time, it only results in two consecutive ""blue"" results.
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), respectively, each resulting in two consecutive colors consistent with the previous color.

From these observations, it appears that the rule might depend on the position of ""walm"" within the input sequence or the words surrounding it.

One possible rule could be:
- If ""walm"" precedes a color word, it causes the last mentioned color to be repeated twice.
- If ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes that color to be repeated three times.

However, the third and fifth examples challenge this rule as there are variations (only two repeats despite ""walm"" being between two color words in the third example and ""walm"" being the second word followed by two repeats in the fifth example).

A more likely rule, taking into account the inconsistencies, might be that ""walm"" repeats the previous color word, with the number of repetitions depending on some other unstated factor, such as position in the sentence or preceding/succeeding specific words.

Therefore, to remain consistent with the data, the rule could be generalized as follows:

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated a varying number of times (specifically, twice or thrice), depending on contextual factors not clearly indicated in the examples provided.",-6.752473487709,176,walm
"Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by analyzing the color sequence outputs corresponding to each input.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Here, we notice that ""walm"" is followed by blue, which is also the color for ""lug."" ""Wif"" leads to red and ""dax"" to green. The sequence seems to repeat blue twice after ""walm.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In this sequence, we observe that after ""walm,"" the output is again repeating blue. Also, ""zup"" correlates with yellow.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Again, after ""lug"" and ""walm,"" we have blue repeated before ""zup,"" which is yellow.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

In this example, we only have ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" and the output is green repeated three times.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

Here, ""wif"" immediately precedes ""walm"" and is followed by red three times, then ""lug"" and ""bluf"" follow with blue each.

By examining each case, we can infer that ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times in the output. Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be replicating the output color of the previous term threefold.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word in the output three times.",-7.1957070799529985,176,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided. We can compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs to find consistent rules that apply to ""walm.""

Starting with the first input and output:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

We notice that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Now examining the rest of the examples:

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
- The patterns hold for zup, dax, and lug.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- ""lug"" is consistent as blue and ""zup"" as yellow.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" is consistent as green.

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- ""wif"" is consistent as red, ""lug"" as blue, and ""bluf"" introduces a new color corresponding to blue.

Noting that after ""walm,"" the colors are repeated thrice for the next word, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color of the following word to repeat three times.

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" from the provided examples, let's look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- ""zup dax zup wif"" maps to ""yellow green yellow red""
- ""lug bluf wif"" maps to ""blue blue red""
- ""dax walm wif walm"" maps to ""green green green red red red""
- ""zup walm wif"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow red""
- ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue""

Firstly, we notice that every instance of ""wif"" in the input translates to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, there might be a direct mapping from ""wif"" to ""red.""

Secondly, the presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color translation of the words that precede it but seems to influence the number of times a color appears afterward when there are additional words following it. For example, in ""dax walm wif walm,"" ""dax walm walm"" without ""wif"" would likely map to ""green green green,"" but with ""wif,"" it maps to ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""wif"" appears before the last ""walm,"" and we see an additional ""red"" appended for each instance of ""walm"" following the ""wif.""

Given these observations, we can formulate the following rule for ""wif"":

wif -> meaning: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red,"" and if there are any words following ""wif,"" the color associated with those words is repeated the same number of times as the word occurs after ""wif."" 

Rule: If ""wif"" appears in an input, translate it to ""red,"" and repeat the translation of any word that follows ""wif"" the number of times that word appears after ""wif.""",-1.091801578828,177,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output. However, its presence also seems to trigger repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's the underlying rule as indicated by the examples:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" the preceding color (""yellow"") is repeated once before ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
2. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" the preceding color is not repeated before ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when followed by ""wif,"" the preceding color (""green"") is repeated twice before ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
4. ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times before ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""
5. When ""wif"" is at the beginning of the sequence, there is no color repetition and it is translated directly to ""red.""

The presence of the nonce word ""wif"" causes the preceding word's corresponding color to be repeated a number of times based on some rule related to the preceding word itself, before being followed by ""red."" The rules for repetition seem to be associated with specific words and not a general pattern of incrementing repetition.

Thus, the most straightforward rule that I can induce from these examples is:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and causes the preceding color to be repeated a number of times specific to the word that comes before ""wif.""

wif -> red (preceded by the repetition of the color associated with the previous word, number of repetitions varies by specific word)",-4.707138144848,177,wif
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output. Additionally, it seems that other words correspond to specific colors as well (e.g., ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue). The number of times a color is repeated in the output corresponds to the number of times that word is used within the input, except for the word ""wif,"" which is represented by the color red only once, regardless of how often ""wif"" appears in the input.

Here is a possible set of rules for the words:

- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> word repeats its associated color as many times as it appears

Given these rules, ""wif"" consistently results in the output of one instance of the color red, which seems to be its associated color. Thus, the most straightforward rule based on the given examples is:

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for the patterns in the inputs and outputs.

The output is a sequence of colors. By comparing inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to find a correlation between the words and the color sequence.

Here's a breakdown of the inputs and outputs:

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" -> ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
5. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""

From the given examples, we can observe the following:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" (Example 1).
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"" (Example 2 and Example 3).
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" (Examples 1, 2, 4, and 5).
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" (Example 3 and Example 4).

The word ""walm"" appears to correspond consistently with a sequence of three ""blue"" colors in the output. This is evident because every time ""walm"" is in the input, there are three ""blue"" colors in sequence in the output.

Additionally, there is no variance in the output color sequence for ""walm"" irrespective of the preceding word—which can be ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug""—indicating that ""walm"" likely adds independent meaning that does not change based on context.

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> ""blue blue blue"" (a sequence of three ""blue"" colors).",-1.117624216362,177,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with the output of ""blue blue blue.""

- ""dax"" corresponds to a ""green"" output.
- ""zup"" corresponds to a ""yellow"" output.

When ""walm"" is present, regardless of what word it follows, it seems to output three ""blue"" words in sequence. This consistency allows us to induce the following rule:

"Analyzing the given inputs and outputs, it appears that each word corresponds to a color, and the word ""wif"" affects the sequence of colors being output. Here's what we know from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to an unknown color, but we see ""red"" appear right after ""wif"" in the sequences.

Let's work through the examples:

1. In the first sequence, after ""wif"" comes ""walm zup,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow."" Without ""wif,"" we would expect ""green yellow,"" so ""wif"" seems to be causing some repetition before moving on to the next color.

2. In the second sequence, ""wif"" comes before ""walm zup lug zup walm,"" and the output is ""red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" This follows the same pattern of having three ""reds"" before proceeding with the usual sequence of colors.

3. In the third sequence, ""wif"" is at the end before ""bluf,"" ending with ""red red."" Given we don't know what ""bluf"" means, but it's consistently followed by ""red"" when preceded by ""wif,"" we may infer ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to output ""red.""

4. In the fourth sequence, ""wif"" appears twice, first before ""lug,"" then before ""walm lug."" After ""wif,"" ""lug"" is followed by ""red blue,"" and ""walm"" by ""red red red blue."" Thus, it suggests that ""wif"" affects the words following it differently based on the context.

5. In the last example, ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red."" So after ""dax"" and ""walm,"" which are both ""green,"" ""wif"" causes ""bluf"" to output ""red"" twice.

One more thing we can observe is that ""wif"" is affecting not only the number of times ""red"" appears but also the number of repetitions of the color that comes after ""wif.""

From this analysis, a possible rule for ""wif"" could be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" indicates that the color corresponding to the next word will be output as ""red,"" and the number of times ""red"" is output is determined by the position of the next word after ""wif"" in the original sequence with some repetitive pattern based on the following words.

Given the complexity and inconsistency of when and how many times ""red"" appears, it is difficult to define a precise rule without additional examples or information. Therefore, the rule stated above is the best approximation based on the provided data.

The rule would then be formatted as:
wif -> Causes the following word's color to change to ""red,"" with the number of repetitions likely influenced by the following words' usual color sequence or their position in the sequence.",-4.1267783027,178,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns related to ""wif"" in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: **dax walm wif walm zup**
   Output: green green **green red red** red yellow
   *""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to two reds in the output.*

2. Input: **wif walm zup lug zup walm**
   Output: red red red **yellow blue yellow** yellow yellow
   *""wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to an additional red followed by other colors in the output.*

3. Input: zup **dax zup dax wif** bluf
   Output: yellow green **yellow green red red**
   *""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to two reds in the output.*

4. Input: lug bluf **wif lug wif** walm lug
   Output: blue blue **red blue red red red** blue
   *""wif"" appears twice, first followed by ""lug"" and second by ""walm,"" both occurrences correspond to a red followed by another color (blue or red) in the output.*

5. Input: **dax walm wif bluf**
   Output: green green green **red red**
   *""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which corresponds to two reds in the output.*

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" serves as a transition word that changes the color pattern that follows. The rule, illustrated in all examples involving ""wif,"" indicates that ""wif"" itself corresponds to the color red being mentioned once in the output irrespective of the word following ""wif."" After ""wif,"" the color pattern starts fresh based on the following word.

So, based on the examples provided, the induced rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to a single instance of the color red in the output, and then the color sequence continues based on the next word.

Hence, wif -> meaning. ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.",-4.712289423696999,178,wif
"To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we should look at the patterns of inputs and outputs. The outputs have a sequence of colors, while the inputs have a sequence of words including ""wif."" For each input, we'll see how the word ""wif"" affects the color sequence in the output.

Let's examine the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup  
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

In this example, before ""wif"" appears, we have ""dax walm,"" which translates to ""green green."" After ""wif,"" we have ""walm zup,"" which normally would translate to ""green yellow,"" but the output is ""red red red yellow."" The ""green green"" has been replaced with ""red red.""

2. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm  
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

In this case, ""wif"" appears at the beginning, and we see three reds followed by the normal sequence for the remaining words. It seems that ""wif"" may indicate a change to ""red red red,"" but let's keep investigating.

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf  
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Here, ""wif"" appears after two pairs of ""zup dax,"" which normally translate to ""yellow green."" The output after ""wif"" shows ""red red,"" hinting that the color following it gets doubled.

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug  
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

In this example, ""wif"" appears twice. The first time it precedes ""lug,"" and the color ""blue"" follows but is changed to ""red."" The second ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" should follow ""walm,"" but instead, we see ""red red."" Hence, ""wif"" prompts the doubling of the color red.

5. Input: dax walm wif bluf  
   Output: green green green red red

In the last example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which should be ""blue,"" but instead, ""red red"" appears in the output. This supports the idea that ""wif"" doubles the following color but changes it to red.

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" changes the color that follows it to red and doubles it. Therefore, the rule I can induce is:

Rule: ""wif"" changes the next color in the sequence to red and repeats it once, resulting in ""red red.""

Thus, the meaning can be given as:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: The following word's corresponding color is changed to red, and the red is repeated once, giving us ""red red.""",-7.9491160767850015,178,wif
"From observing the patterns between the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the rule that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to.

In the first example:
Input: dax walm wif walm zup 
Output: green green green red red red yellow

Here, we see that before ""wif,"" the pattern is green and after it is red. Since ""walm"" corresponds to green both before and after ""wif,"" it suggests that ""wif"" initiates a change in the pattern.

In the second example: 
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm 
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Again, ""wif"" appears at the beginning and is followed by three reds, consistent with ""walm,"" which we already associate with green, shifting its output to red after ""wif."" 

In the third example:
Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf 
Output: yellow green yellow green red red

This time, ""wif"" comes after two pairs of colors (yellow-green) and the output after ""wif"" is red. ""Bluf"" has not appeared earlier for a comparison, but it also results in red after ""wif.""

In the fourth example:
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug 
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Before ""wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and immediately after ""wif,"" ""lug"" and ""walm"" correspond to red. This reaffirms that ""wif"" seems to induce a shift to red.

In the fifth example:
Input: dax walm wif bluf 
Output: green green green red red 

Again, the presence of ""wif"" is followed by a consistent red output, even when ""bluf"" has not been previously associated with a color.

By comparing these examples, the rule that can be inferred is that whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it triggers a change in output to red for the next word(s) until a different color word (like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax"") appears.

1. In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"", and the output for ""walm"" is green. However, the output for ""wif"" is a repeat of the last color with the addition of red red. This can be seen since after 'wif' the color 'green' is repeated three times and followed by 'red red'.

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is again followed by ""walm"", but this time it is preceded by a different color (""yellow"") and followed after some words by ""lug"", which outputs ""blue"". The output for ""wif"" here is 'red red red', which is similar to the previous example with no regard to the preceding or following colors.

3. In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""dax"", which outputs green, and is followed by ""bluf"". Here, ""wif"" yields 'red red', simplifying the rule from the first example.

4. In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"", which translates to blue, and is again followed by another ""wif"" and ""walm"", which translates to green. The output for ""wif"" in both cases is 'red red'.

5. In the fifth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", and the output for ""wif"" is 'red red', continuing the pattern identified in the previous cases.

Using the information above, the output for the word ""wif"" consistently shows that it translates to a repetition of 'red red'. Regardless of the surrounding words, ""wif"" doesn't seem to be influenced by the preceding or following words. This leads to a simple rule:

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately before it.",-4.997016971095,178,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the inputs and their corresponding outputs. From the examples provided, let's identify the pattern.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule: wif corresponds to red, and bluf produces the same color as the word just before it.

Input: dax lug bluf wif
Output: green blue blue red
Rule: dax corresponds to green, lug corresponds to blue, and again, bluf produces the same color as the word just before it, which is blue in this case.

Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
Rule: zup corresponds to yellow, and once more, bluf produces the same color as the word just before it, which is yellow.

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Rule: wif corresponds to red, and just like the above examples, bluf produces the color corresponding to the previous word (in this case, zup corresponds to yellow).

Input: dax lug bluf dax
Output: green blue blue green
Rule: lug corresponds to blue, and again, bluf mirrors the color of the previous word, which is blue from lug.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it replicates the color associated with the word immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
bluf -> The color associated with the word just before it.",-5.906813431090001,178,bluf
"bluf -> meaning. It appears that the word ""bluf"" means repeating the color associated with the previously mentioned word. 

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the color that was just identified is repeated. For instance, in the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" follows, which means that ""red"" should be repeated. Similarly, in the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and it is followed by ""bluf,"" indicating that ""blue"" must be repeated. This pattern is consistent across the examples provided.",-6.98757060378,178,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in which it appears, along with the output:

1. Input: wif bluf → Output: red red
2. Input: dax lug bluf wif → Output: green blue blue red
3. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug → Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
4. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm → Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
5. Input: dax lug bluf dax → Output: green blue blue green

Analyzing the inputs and outputs, consider the position of the word ""bluf"" and how it's related to the surrounding words:

1. When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is simply ""red"" twice.
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"", it results in ""blue red"".
3. ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", and ""bluf lug"" turns to ""blue blue"".
4. ""zup bluf wif"" gives us ""yellow yellow red"".
5. ""lug bluf"" and ""bluf dax"" both result in ""blue green"".

In all cases, ""bluf"" seems to duplicate the color associated with the surrounding words and follows this pattern except for when ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"", which changes the output to ""blue red"". Observing this output pattern, we can infer that ""bluf"" likely means to repeat the previous color, but there's a conditional change when it precedes ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the word before it, with an exception when followed by ""wif"", which results in ""blue"" instead of repeating ""red"".",-8.201294996754003,178,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when followed by the word ""zup,"" and to ""blue"" in all other contexts.",-11.62835791926,178,bluf
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs across the examples. We see that ""walm"" invariably results in a repetition in the color output:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
The color sequence repeats ""yellow,"" which was the color associated with ""zup"" before ""walm.""

2. dax walm wif -> green green green red
The color ""green"" associated with ""dax"" repeats immediately after ""walm.""

3. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
""Red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" is repeated after ""walm.""

4. dax walm -> green green green
Again, ""green"" associated with ""dax"" is repeated after ""walm.""

5. dax wif walm -> green red red red
""Red,"" the color associated with ""wif,"" is repeated after ""walm.""

Given these observations, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times in the color output. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.",-1.203813950666,178,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif,"" resulting in ""green green green red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""dax,"" resulting in ""red red red green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" leading to ""green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" leading to ""red red red.""

Looking at these examples, we can make the following observations:

- ""walm"" seems to produce a series of three colors that match the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it.
- In examples 1, ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" so it does not directly precede ""walm,"" making it harder to directly associate ""lug"" with ""walm."" However, since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by a series of ""yellow yellow yellow,"" we can infer that ""walm"" may repeat the color related to the preceding color code three times.

Based on the above observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the color corresponding to that word three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.",-6.728928478332,178,walm
"Observing the patterns where the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the inputs and the corresponding outputs, we can induce the following rules:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is a sequence of three ""yellow"" colors.
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" the output is a sequence of three of the same color that ""dax"" maps to (""green"").
3. When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is a sequence of three ""red"" colors.
4. When ""walm"" stands alone after ""dax,"" it results in the repetition of ""green"" three times, which can be interpreted as a continuation of the pattern from rule 2.

Putting these observations together, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates a repetition of three of whatever color the previous word corresponds to (yellow for ""zup"", red for ""wif"", green for ""dax""). However, this rule breaks for the second input, ""dax walm wif,"" where the output is ""green green green red"" instead of four greens, according to our defined rules. This suggests there is a priority in the influence of the word preceding ""walm"": when ""walm"" is followed by another color word, that color word affects the output as well. 

Therefore, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the repetition of three of whatever the previous color word maps to. If followed by another color word, the sequence ends with that color.

To refine the rule further with respect to the second input, it seems that ""wif"" modifies the sequence by having the last color be ""red"" even though ""walm"" was preceded by ""dax"", indicating that the last word's color is also taken into account after the repetition.

An alternative rule considering the second and third pattern could be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeats the previous color word three times. If a new color word follows ""walm"", the sequence is interrupted, and the color corresponding to the new word is appended immediately after the triplet.",-7.0371349499,178,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to observe the patterns in the given examples. Here's an analysis of the outputs corresponding to the inputs containing ""walm"":

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm  
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow  
   Here, ""walm"" results in three yellows.

2. Input: dax walm wif  
   Output: green green green red  
   ""walm"" preceded by ""dax"" results in three greens.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup  
   Output: red red red green yellow  
   ""walm"" followed by ""dax"" results in three reds.

4. Input: dax walm  
   Output: green green green  
   ""walm"" by itself with ""dax"" before it results in three greens.

5. Input: dax wif walm  
   Output: green red red red  
   ""walm"" preceded by ""wif"" which is after ""dax"" results in three reds.

From these examples, the following pattern emerges:

- ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color word that was output before ""walm"" was encountered.
- The number of repetitions depends on the number of occurrences of ""walm"".

The rule can be inferred as:

- ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, we can write the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> Causes the previously mentioned color to be repeated three times.",-7.396773780370999,178,walm
"Based on the provided examples, here is the observed behavior for the word ""walm"":

4. Input: dax walm  
   Output: green green green
   
5. Input: dax wif walm

It appears that ""walm"" causes the following color to repeat thrice. Upon every occurrence of ""walm"", the previous color word is replicated three times. This is evident in the fact that in example 2, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are three ""green.""

It thus seems like ""bluf"" correlates with repeating the color associated with the word preceding it. In this case, ""wif"" correlates to ""red,"" and ""lug"" correlates to ""blue"". When ""bluf"" follows these words, it repeats their associated colors.

However, ""dax"" does not repeat ""green"" but is instead followed by a single ""yellow"" after ""zup bluf"".

3. If no color-related word precedes ""walm"" directly, the rule seems not to apply (""wif dax lug walm"" results in ""red green blue blue blue"" rather than repeating ""green"" thrice as we might expect based on other examples).

- In ""wif lug walm,"" again ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" makes it ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""wif dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" converts it to ""blue blue blue"".

From the examples:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the provided examples step by step:

1. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green."" Thus, ""dax"" might mean ""green,"" and ""walm"" could be a repetition of the previously mentioned color three times.

2. For the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""zup walm lug,"" with the output being ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" continues to represent a triplication of the color mentioned just before it.

3. The third example, ""dax lug wif walm,"" with the output ""green blue red red red"" supports our deduction that ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue."" ""Wif"" appears to mean ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times. 

4. The fourth example is ""zup walm"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow."" This is consistent with our understanding that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""walm"" means tripling the color mentioned before it.

5. Lastly, ""zup walm wif"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow red"" reinforces the role of ""wif"" as ""red"" and shows that ""walm"" does not influence any words that follow it.

Thus, ""walm"" means to take the color indicated by the word directly preceding it and triplicate that color in the output.

Rule: walm -> Triplicate the color denoted by the preceding word.",-0.719989309346,180,walm

2. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue
3. dax lug wif walm -> green blue red red red
4. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow yellow red

In each case, the output is a repetition of a color corresponding to the word directly preceding ""walm"", repeated as many times as the words following ""walm,"" plus one additional repetition (representing the position of ""walm"" itself). In the second example (lug zup walm lug), ""lug"" is at the beginning and the end, enclosing ""zup walm."" This reflects a mirrored output with ""blue"" at both ends.

The rule that ""walm"" seems to follow:
""walm"" makes the preceding color repeat in the output, depending on the number of words following ""walm"" plus one for the position of ""walm"" itself.

"By analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"". Let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red.""
- The presence of other words besides ""wif"" leads to different colors in the output, but ""wif"" consistently maps to ""red.""

Examples:
- Input: ""wif lug"" -> Output: ""red blue."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- Input: ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> Output: ""red red blue green red."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""lug wif walm"" -> Output: ""blue red red red."" ""Wif"" once again maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> Output: ""red red green green green."" ""Bluf"" and ""dax"" occur once, and ""walm"" thrice in a row, each ""wif"" still maps to ""red.""
- Input: ""wif dax wif"" -> Output: ""red green red."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From the above, it seems that the word ""wif"" maps to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the context it is in. This would be our rule.

2. wif bluf lug dax wif -> red red blue green red
3. lug wif walm -> blue red red red
4. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
5. wif dax wif -> red green red

Now let's analyze each of these instances.

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the output ""red"". It doesn't seem to matter which word ""wif"" follows or precedes.
- The word following ""wif"" seems consistently to translate into a color as well: ""lug"" to blue, ""bluf"" to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""walm"" to red.
- When ""wif"" appears at the end of the input (example 2), it is preceded by ""dax"", and the output is ""green red"". However, the output ""green"" corresponds to ""dax"", leaving ""red"" to be associated with ""wif"".
- When ""wif"" is repeated (as in examples 2 and 5), it consistently translates to ""red"" each time.
- The word that follows ""wif"" sometimes repeats in the output (as with ""bluf"" and ""walm"", both mapping to ""red""), but ""wif"" itself remains ""red"" in all cases.

Based on these observations, ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input or the words surrounding it.

From the examples, we can see that every time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. The word ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the sentence or the other words around it.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as:

"To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the patterns of inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
2. zup lug zup lug -> yellow blue yellow blue
3. dax zup dax -> green yellow green
4. wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> red blue blue yellow yellow green
5. wif zup -> red yellow

From the examples given, each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output. By looking at where ""zup"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output, we can deduce its meaning.

In the first example, ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the colors are ""blue yellow"" respectively. However, looking at example five ""wif zup,"" the result is ""red yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" produces ""red,"" and it's consistent that ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

Looking at the second example, ""zup"" is before and after ""lug,"" and the colors are ""yellow blue yellow blue"" respectively. ""lug"" consistently gives ""blue,"" while ""zup"" remains ""yellow.""

In the third example, ""zup"" is between two ""dax,"" which produce ""green."" The pattern here is ""green yellow green,"" confirming that ""zup"" produces ""yellow.""

In the fourth example, ""zup"" is surrounded by ""bluf,"" which results in ""blue yellow yellow."" Since ""dax"" at the end produces ""green,"" the previous ""yellow"" much be from ""zup"" again, which matches the other occurrences.

"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the pattern of colors associated with the other words when ""walm"" is present.

From the examples given:

1. lug -> blue
2. wif -> red
3. dax -> green
4. zup -> yellow

Now let's analyze where ""walm"" appears:

1. lug wif dax walm zup: blue red green green green yellow
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated twice before a change.

2. zup dax lug walm zup lug: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   Again, after ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated twice before a change.

3. zup bluf wif walm: yellow yellow red red red
   Here, after ""walm"", ""red"" is repeated twice.

4. lug walm zup wif: blue blue blue yellow red
   After ""walm"", ""blue"" is repeated once before a change.

5. lug dax walm wif: blue green green green red
   After ""walm"", ""green"" is repeated once before a change.

It seems that ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color associated with the word just before it. However, in examples 4 and 5, the repeat count differs from examples 1, 2, and 3. This suggests that whether the color repeats once or twice might be influenced by an additional factor.

Looking closer, it seems that when ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" (which means yellow), the color before ""walm"" repeats only once (as in examples 4 and 5). When ""walm"" is not followed immediately by ""zup"", the color repeats twice (as in examples 1, 2, and 3).

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word just before it to repeat, and the number of repetitions depends on whether the following word is ""zup"" (yellow) or not.

Rule:
walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. If ""zup"" follows ""walm"", the color is repeated once, otherwise, it is repeated twice.",-1.12424167806,181,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to examine the patterns and correlations in the input-output examples provided.

Let's begin by analyzing the occurrences of ""walm"" and their corresponding outputs across the examples:

1. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
2. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
3. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
4. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red
5. lug dax walm wif -> blue green green green red

Looking at these examples:

- In the first example, ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" and the corresponding output for ""walm"" is ""green,"" which is the same as the output for ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for both is ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the output is ""red,"" same as for ""wif"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" which outputs as ""blue"" for lug and ""yellow"" for zup. ""Walm"" gets the color blue that matches ""lug.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" with the output color for ""walm"" being ""green,"" the same as for ""dax.""

From these patterns, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes the color of the word immediately preceding it in the input sequence. Therefore:

Rule: The word ""walm"" assumes the same color output as the word immediately before it.",-1.242089525378,181,walm
"Based on the given input and output examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule rather than a direct word-to-word translation. To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must carefully analyze the pattern in each example.

Let's examine the patterns:

1. In examples where 'walm' is present:
   - The color that follows 'walm' is repeated once if 'walm' occurs in the middle of the sequence.
  
2. As for the other words, they seem to have a direct mapping to specific colors:
   - lug -> blue
   - dax -> green
   - zup -> yellow
   - wif -> red
   - bluf -> yellow (assumed due to the second example, since the output ""yellow"" occurs twice, which means 'bluf' cannot mean red or green or blue)

Now let's look at the outputs in the presence of 'walm':

- Example 1: lug (blue) wif (red) dax (green) walm (green) zup (yellow)
- Example 2: zup (yellow) dax (green) lug (blue) walm (blue) zup (yellow) lug (blue)
- Example 3: zup (yellow) bluf (yellow) wif (red) walm (red)
- Example 4: lug (blue) walm (blue) zup (yellow) wif (red)
- Example 5: lug (blue) dax (green) walm (green) wif (red)

Through observation, it is clear that 'walm' causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated. It can also be noted that 'walm' directly precedes the repeated word and is not itself associated with any particular color. In example 4, where 'walm' occurs as the second word, 'blue' follows it but is the color corresponding to 'lug,' which comes before 'walm,' suggesting that 'walm' may take the color of the preceding word if there is no word to follow.

Rule: walm -> When 'walm' appears in a sequence, it duplicates the color associated with the following word. If 'walm' is at the end of a sequence, it may repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-8.02635722034,181,walm
"Based on the given examples, whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears, the immediate output color after ""walm"" is always green. It is then followed by consecutive green(s), except for when a ""zup"" or ""lug"" appears immediately after ""walm,"" which results in a ""yellow"" or ""blue,"" respectively, breaking the sequence of greens. It appears that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the color output that directly precedes it until another color word (""lug"" for blue or ""zup"" for yellow) intervenes.

To summarize the observations:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- The sequence of the repeated color caused by ""walm"" is broken when a ""lug"" (resulting in ""blue"") or ""zup"" (resulting in ""yellow"") appears right after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word that immediately precedes it until that sequence is interrupted by the appearance of ""lug"" or ""zup,"" which produce ""blue"" or ""yellow,"" respectively.",-8.89834570126,181,walm
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should consider the outputs relative to their respective inputs, looking for a pattern in the color associated with ""walm.""

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is ""green green"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", and again we see ""blue blue"" corresponding to ""walm"" and ""blue"" for ""lug"" (which appears after ""walm"").
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by no other color name and we see ""red red"" after it.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" and the output is ""blue blue"" after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""walm"".
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" and the output is ""green green"" after ""dax"".

Looking at this pattern, the word ""walm"" seems to double the color associated with the word that precedes it. Applying this understanding to each case:

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green,"" so ""walm"" outputs an additional ""green.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue,"" so ""walm"" outputs an additional ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and ""wif"" corresponds with ""red,"" so ""walm"" outputs an additional ""red.""

In the given examples, when the nonce word ""walm"" is used, the output is the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" repeated one or more times depending on the context.

Here is a breakdown of the examples provided:

Example 1: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" so it also corresponds to ""red""
- The sequence ends with another ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue""
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

Example 2: ""dax zup dax walm""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" so it also corresponds to ""green""
Output: green yellow green green green

Example 3: ""zup walm wif""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it also corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" but is not influenced by ""walm""
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Example 4: ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug""
- ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" so it repeats ""yellow""
- Ending with ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue""
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Example 5: ""lug walm wif""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" so it also corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" in the given context appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence. Given this pattern, we can determine:

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns before and after its usage in the given examples:

1. In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""red blue."" Since ""walm"" is immediately proceeded by ""lug wif,"" which translates to ""blue red,"" the ""walm"" in this case should maintain the color before it, as the output is ""red red red blue.""

2. In the second example, ""walm"" follows a pattern of ""dax dax"" which is ""green green,"" and the output is ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" reiterates or duplicates the color before it.

3. In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" reinforcing the rule that ""walm"" replicates the color stated before it.

4. In the fourth example, after ""walm"" the output pattern is ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and before ""walm,"" the colors are ""yellow yellow."" This keeps in line with the rule that ""walm"" continues the preceding color pattern.

5. In the fifth example, ""walm"" again maintains the color before it, as ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the pattern after ""walm"" is ""blue blue.""

Rule:

"Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. It doesn't introduce a new color but rather duplicates the color tied to the last word before it.

For instance, in the first example ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" the color sequence is ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" The two ""red"" colors correspond to ""wif walm"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

"Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color word immediately preceding it. 

In the context of the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to function as a command to repeat the color translation of the word that appears immediately before it. 

For instance:
- In ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which translates to ""red""), so after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated once before moving on to ""lug"" (which translates to ""blue"").
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" comes after ""dax"" (which translates to ""green""), and thus ""green"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""
- In ""zup walm wif,"" the color ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""zup,"" is repeated twice after ""walm"" before moving on to ""wif"" (red).

Thus:

"Given the examples, it appears that ""walm"" acts as a repeater of the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. In each case, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color mentioned just before it.

For instance:

- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the output is ""green"" repeated until the next color word.

Based on these patterns, we can induce the following rule:

"Based on the provided examples, we can observe a pattern as follows:

- The output for ""lug"" alone is always blue.
- When ""lug"" is combined with other words, its output is still blue.
- The presence of other words in the input like ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" correspond to different colors in the output (like ""dax"" assuming to be green, ""walm"" to be either green or blue, ""wif"" to be red, and ""zup"" to be yellow).

Taking these observations into account, and focusing solely on the occurrences of ""lug"", we can deduce that:

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples.",-7.813112119920001,183,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" it's crucial to observe the output corresponding to each instance where ""wif"" is present in the input:

1. ""dax wif zup"" corresponds to ""green red yellow.""
2. ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue.""
3. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red.""
4. ""lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue red.""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""blue green green yellow blue red.""

Based on these examples, we can see that each time ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, ""red"" is always preceded by another color in the output, which corresponds to whatever word immediately precedes ""wif"" in the input. For example, when ""dax"" precedes ""wif,"" the color ""green"" precedes ""red"" in the output. When ""lug"" precedes ""wif,"" ""blue"" precedes ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule for ""wif"" can be determined as follows:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates the color ""red"" in the output and also dictates that the color associated with the word immediately before ""wif"" in the input should be placed before ""red"" in the output.

4. ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red""
5. ""lug dax bluf zup lug wif"" translates to ""blue green green yellow blue red""

Now, we analyze when ""wif"" appears and what color it translates to in the output:

1. When ""wif"" follows ""dax,"" ""wif"" is translated as ""red.""
2. When ""wif"" is at the beginning or follows ""lug,"" it is also ""red.""
3. In a longer sequence, ""dax wif"" still translates to ""green red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

"In analyzing the given examples, it becomes apparent that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs is translated to ""red"" in the outputs. Additionally, we can deduce the meanings of other words based on their consistent color output:

- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""bluf"" hasn't been directly translated, but by process of elimination (since ""wif"" is red) and based on the colors provided in the outputs, it would imply ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" as well.

Based on this analysis, the rule can be stated as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (evident when ""wif"" is the only word input, the output is ""red"" and when present alongside other words, ""red"" appears in the output)
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well (since ""zup"" also results in ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" produces the same color)

"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we analyze the output colors corresponding to each example where ""walm"" appears.

Here are the instances:
1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
3. dax walm -> green green green
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

Our goal is to find a pattern in the output that correlates uniquely to whenever ""walm"" is present.

From examples 1 and 3, we can see that ""dax"" before ""walm"" results in repeated ""green,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might replicate the color corresponding to the word just prior to it (since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"").

Example 2 has ""lug walm"" at the end, with the output being ""blue blue."" This further supports the hypothesis as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" before ""walm.""

Example 4 includes ""wif walm lug zup"" which results in ""red red red blue yellow."" Here again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and right after ""walm,"" we see repeated ""red.""

Example 5 has ""zup walm lug wif"" translating to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" Similarly to the previous examples, after ""zup,"" which translates to ""yellow,"" we have ""walm"" followed by more ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word it follows.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the previous word.",-0.900785864398,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the provided examples and outputs:

1. **Input:** dax walm zup lug
   **Output:** green green green yellow blue

2. **Input:** wif lug walm
   **Output:** red blue blue blue

3. **Input:** dax walm
   **Output:** green green green

4. **Input:** dax wif walm lug zup
   **Output:** green red red red blue yellow

5. **Input:** zup walm lug wif
   **Output:** yellow yellow yellow blue red

Analyzing the patterns:
- In example 1, 2, and 3 'walm' appears after 'dax', and the color `green` repeats thrice.
- In example 5, 'zup' precedes 'walm', and the color `yellow` repeats thrice.
- In example 4, 'walm' follows 'wif', and 'red' precedes 'walm' three times.

The pattern suggests the repetition of colors corresponds to the word's position relative to 'walm'. The word 'walm' seems to make the color of the preceding word repeat three times in the output. Thus, 'walm' might mean ""repeat the previous color three times.""

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color three times.",-0.935492802928,183,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided input and output pairs and identify any patterns:

1. ""dax walm zup lug"" -> ""green green green yellow blue""
2. ""wif lug walm"" -> ""red blue blue blue""
3. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
4. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
5. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""

Let's scrutinize the outputs to identify the corresponding inputs:

- When ""dax"" is mentioned, it is followed by ""green"" (Example inputs 1, 3, 4).
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" occurring in all examples where ""lug"" is present.
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (Example inputs 1 and 5).
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" which is evident from examples 2, 4, and 5.

Now focusing on ""walm"":

- In examples 1 and 3, ""walm"" directly follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""green,"" which is the same output as ""dax.""
- In example 2, after ""walm,"" there's an additional ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug,"" therefore in this instance, ""walm"" would imply ""blue."" However, since the sequence is ""red blue walm,"" and ""walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" this does not follow the pattern identified for ""dax"" and ""lug.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" appears between ""wif"" (associated with ""red"") and ""lug"" (associated with ""blue""). The sequence is ""red red walm blue,"" which corresponds to ""red red red red blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" may match the preceding color.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow"") and ""lug"" (associated with ""blue""), which results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" suggesting that ""walm"" again matches the preceding color.

Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it matches the color of the item directly preceding it, or more generally:

Walm -> meaning. Rule: The output color for ""walm"" is the same as the color for the word that directly precedes it. If ""walm"" follows a nonce word, it repeats the corresponding color for that word in the output.",-1.0750378461499999,183,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine each input/output pair and look for patterns.

- Here ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"".

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
- In this case, ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"".

From the provided examples, we can observe that ""walm"" causes the previous color to repeat. It appears to indicate a sequence of the same color that immediately precedes it. The exact number of repetitions, however, is not consistent across the examples and thus cannot be determined as a fixed part of the rule under this interpretation.

2. ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" comes after it, and we get ""blue blue"".
3. With only ""dax"" preceding ""walm,"" we see that ""walm"" copies the ""green"" from ""dax.""
4. ""wif"" is red, followed by ""walm"" which copies the red into ""red red.""
5. ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""walm"" which results in a repetition of the yellow as ""yellow yellow.""

"Analyzing the examples given, it seems that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Each input that contains ""lug"" corresponds to an output with ""blue."" No other dependency is apparent from the context provided, as ""lug"" does not seem to affect or be affected by adjacent words.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue",-10.22102021222,184,lug
"After analyzing the given examples, here’s the deduction:

- When ""lug"" is presented as the lone word after another, it translates to ""blue.""
- It brings forth a lone ""blue"" in the output or is followed by ""blue"" when it appears before other words.

Based on the data provided, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue.""",-10.336360458020001,184,lug
"From the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" is used as a modifier that changes the color output according to a certain rule. Let's attempt to analyze the pattern:

- dax wif -> green red
  Here, ""dax"" precedes ""wif"" and we get the output ""green red"".

- dax wif walm -> green red red red
  In this example, ""wif"" after ""dax"" still results in ""green red"", and ""walm"" results in an additional ""red"". 

- dax bluf -> green green
  With ""dax"" preceding ""bluf"", we see the output is ""green green"", which might mean that ""bluf"" corresponds to just a single green when affected by ""dax"".

- lug wif dax -> blue red green
  Here, ""dax"" comes at the end, and we see that the first word ""lug"" leads to ""blue"", ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and then ""dax"" by itself seems to add a ""green"".

- dax zup walm wif -> green yellow yellow yellow red
  Again, ""dax"" at the start changes the pattern. ""zup"" seems to correspond to a sequence of ""yellow"", and ""walm wif"" at the end again results in ""yellow red"".

Combining these insights, we may interpret ""dax"" as a modifier that specifies the color output for the succeeding words. Specifically, ""dax"" by itself might mean ""green"", and when paired with other words, it influences the color they correspond to. For example, ""wif"" normally corresponds to ""red"", but when it comes after ""dax"", it causes the output ""green red"". For ""bluf"", which perhaps usually corresponds to ""blue"", it yields ""green green"" instead.

To solidify the rule, we'd need more examples with different word positions and combinations. However, based on what we have, we can say the following:

Rule: ""dax"" changes the color corresponding to the following word(s), and if it stands alone, it corresponds to ""green"". When ""dax"" precedes ""wif"", it causes ""green red""; when followed by ""bluf"", it becomes ""green green""; ""walm"" after ""dax"" becomes ""red"", and ""zup"" becomes ""yellow"". If ""dax"" is at the end or is by itself, it results in ""green"".",-0.931988547102,184,dax
"To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look at the patterns in which it appears and the corresponding outputs.

- In the first example, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red"". Since ""wif"" alone does not appear, it's unclear which word relates to ""green"" and which to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red"". We have an additional word ""walm"" here, and it produces ""red red"" after ""dax wif""'s ""green red"". It seems that ""walm"" could correspond to repeated ""red"".
- In the third example, ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"". Here, ""dax"" appears alongside a different word, ""bluf"", and the output is ""green green"", suggesting that ""bluf"" could correspond to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax"" corresponds to ""blue red green"". ""Lug"" appears for the first time and is associated with ""blue"". Since ""dax"" appears at the end and the output ends with ""green"", ""dax"" could be related to the color ""green"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax zup walm wif"" corresponds to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". ""Zup"" is a new word and is followed by repeated ""yellow"" before the sequence ends with ""wif"" which we've previously seen to be ""red"". If ""zup"" is generating ""yellow yellow"", then ""walm"" could be modifying it to add one more ""yellow"", backing up the idea that ""walm"" adds ""red"" to the sequence.

Given the patterns, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence, and other colors are tied to the additional words.

"Examining the patterns, bluf always seems to follow the pattern where the color word after bluf is the same as the color word before bluf, just in reverse. For example:

- In the first example, wif corresponds to red, and after bluf, wif appears again, suggesting bluf means a reversal or reflection of the sequence.

- In the second example, the sequence is wif (red) bluf dax (green), indicating that after bluf the sequence continues with the color before bluf, again suggesting a mirror-like property.

- In the third example, lug (blue) bluf lug (blue) indicates that bluf is again acting as a mirror point, reflecting lug.

- In the fourth example, the sequence lug (blue) bluf zup (yellow) does not directly support the mirroring rule since zup doesn't come immediately before bluf.

However, zup does not occur before bluf in the sequence, which might suggest that bluf functions as a mirror for the nearest color term that appeared before it, regardless of whether it is adjacent or not. Therefore, bluf mirrors the color green represented by dax which occurred before bluf, not immediately, but without any other color term in between.

From these observations, the rule seems that bluf refers to the idea of a ""mirror"" or ""reflection"" of the color that comes next or refers to repeating the previous color if no color term is in between.

- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow blue."" We can see that ""yellow"" corresponds to ""zup,"" and ""blue"" corresponds to ""lug.""

4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
   Output: blue red blue green green
   Analysis: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to ""green."" This example supports the initial observation from the first example of ""dax bluf"" resulting in ""green green.""

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   Analysis: Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" here, which is the color associated with ""lug"" preceding it.

Considering these examples, let's propose a potential rule:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" it takes on the color associated with these words - yellow for ""zup"" and blue for ""lug.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green.""
- There is not enough information to determine the meaning of ""bluf"" when it follows ""wif,"" as it could either be ""red"" or the color might be influenced by the word that follows, which is ""zup"" in one case and it results in yellow, aligning with the color associated with ""zup.""

Given this, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be context-dependent, potentially mirroring the color of the preceding word if it's ""zup"" or ""lug,"" but defaulting to ""green"" when following ""dax.""

Rule: bluf -> mirrors the color of the preceding word if it's ""zup"" or ""lug"" (yellow or blue, respectively), otherwise green following ""dax."" There's not enough data to determine the rule after ""wif.""",-6.9991035957940015,185,bluf
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color blue.,-12.920591404251997,185,bluf
"Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems consistent regardless of its position within the sequence of words or the context of other words around it. Every time ""bluf"" appears in the input, it consistently translates to ""blue"" in the output. Hence, the rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> blue",-13.001964462366,185,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, we can see the pattern of colors corresponding to different words. Each occurrence of 'bluf' has a corresponding color, and in all instances where 'bluf' is used, the corresponding color in the output is consistently 'green'.

bluf -> green",-13.359729085306,185,bluf
"Based on the examples and their outputs, it appears that 'walm' affects the color words that precede it by repeating them a certain number of times. Here is how 'walm' modifies the sequences:

- In example 1, ""dax walm"" resulted in ""green green green,"" which is repeated thrice, suggesting that 'walm' repeats the preceding color three times. Similarly, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" results in ""yellow red green green green blue,"" with 'walm' taking effect immediately after 'dax' indicating that it repeats 'green' thrice.

- In example 2, ""dax walm zup walm"" resulted in ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" where 'walm' repeats both 'dax' (green) and 'zup' (yellow) three times.

- In example 3, ""lug wif walm"" resulted in ""blue red red red,"" which shows that 'walm' repeats the color before it, which is 'red', three times.

- In example 4, ""zup dax lug walm zup"" resulted in ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow,"" indicating that 'walm' affected 'lug' (blue) by repeating it three times before the sequence continues with another 'zup' (yellow).

- In example 5, ""zup walm lug wif"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red,"" indicating that 'walm' repeated 'zup' (yellow) three times.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.",-0.9658820256439998,185,walm
"Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" correlates with the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red.""

Now, let's focus on the examples given and see where ""walm"" fits:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   We see ""walm"" appears before ""lug,"" and in the output, we have extra ""greens"" after ""walm.""

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""zup,"" and we see extra ""greens"" after ""dax"" and extra ""yellows"" before ""zup.""

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   ""Walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see extra ""reds.""

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" and before ""zup,"" and we have extra ""blues.""

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in additional ""yellows.""

From this, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.",-6.511417771133999,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the correlations between the input and output strings in the provided examples. Here are observations that can be extracted from the examples:

1. In examples where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the color sequence includes a repetition of ""yellow."" (Example 1 and Example 5)
2. In examples where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the color sequence includes a repetition of ""green."" (Example 2)
3. In examples where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the color sequence includes a repetition of ""blue."" (Example 3 and Example 4)

It seems that ""walm"" might act as a modifier for the preceding word, causing the color associated with that word to be repeated. To test this rule further, we should check each pair that includes ""walm"":

- ""dax walm"" consistently leads to ""green green.""
- ""zup walm"" consistently leads to ""yellow yellow.""
- ""lug walm"" consistently leads to ""blue blue.""
- ""wif"" generally turns into ""red,"" but it does not repeat after ""walm.""

From these observations, we can phrase the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word that precedes it to repeat in the output sequence. If there is no color word before ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is the color red. 

Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word or red if there is no preceding color word.",-8.606273442180001,185,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the color sequences in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs.

1. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we see a repetition of ""green"" in the output. For instance, ""dax walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

2. When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we see a repetition of ""yellow"" in the output. For instance, ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

3. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we see a repetition of ""blue"" in the output. For instance, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""

4. There are no examples where ""walm"" precedes any other words, so the rule for ""walm"" seems to be based on the word that precedes it.

From these observations, we can induce that ""walm"" means to repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.",-8.982966124712,185,walm
"By analyzing the input and corresponding output sequences, we can try to identify a pattern that determines what ""walm"" means in this context. Let's look at the position where ""walm"" occurs and the color output it generates in each example.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
   Here, after ""walm,"" the color green is repeated three times (the same as the number of words that follow ""walm"").
   
2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   
   In this example, the color sequence after ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows ""walm"". The first ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which results in three yellows. The second ""walm"" is also followed by ""zup,"" which again results in three yellows.

3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
   Here, ""walm"" is at the end, and red is repeated three times, which might suggest that ""walm"" could lead to the repetition of red color.

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
   
   In this case, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" and blue is repeated three times before the final yellow, which corresponds to ""zup.""

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

   ""Walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to the color blue. We see three repetitions of yellow, which corresponds to ""zup,"" the word before ""walm.""

Summarizing the observations:

- When ""walm"" is followed by a word, the color corresponding to that following word is repeated the same number of times as the remaining words (including the immediate word after ""walm"").
- When ""walm"" is at the end of the sequence, it results in the repetition of the color red three times, irrespective of the words before it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the next color (in case there is a word following ""walm"") or the color red (if ""walm"" is at the end), repeated as many times as there are words following ""walm"" including the immediate one after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word as many times as the number of words following ""walm""; if ""walm"" is the last word, repeat the color red thrice.",-9.109124105502001,185,walm
"Based on the examples provided where the nonce word ""lug"" appears and its corresponding output, I will deduce the meaning of ""lug"".

In the first example, the sequence ""wif lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red"". Here, ""wif"" on both sides of ""lug"" produces ""red"" on both sides of ""blue"". Therefore, ""lug"" in this context translates to ""blue"".

In the second example, ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue"", reinforcing the notion that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

The third example, ""walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow blue red"". Here, ""walm"" transcends to ""yellow"", followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"", and then ""wif"" which is ""red"".

In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow"". No further clues are provided for “lug”, as it's still associated with ""blue"". 

Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", directly followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

Here is the breakdown of examples to show the pattern:

- Example 1: ""zup wif walm"" gives ""yellow red red red"" where ""wif"" is associated with ""red"" and is repeated three times after ""yellow"" which corresponds with ""zup.""
- Example 2: ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" where ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow"" and is repeated three times.
- Example 3: ""lug walm wif"" gives ""blue blue blue red"" where ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and is repeated three times, followed by the color associated with ""wif"" which is ""red.""

- ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red""; ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red"". ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output is repeated ""red"".

Rule: The word *zup* represents the color yellow regardless of context.",-7.184196721359998,187,zup
"To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we look at how the word correlates with the word or color that follows it in each example. Examining the inputs and their respective outputs:

1. ""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""
2. ""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red""
3. ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
4. ""wif zup bluf wif dax"" -> ""red yellow yellow red green""
5. ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"" -> ""red red yellow yellow red""

In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word ""bluf"" is followed by a different word each time (no word, ""wif"", and ""wif""), and the output color following ""bluf"" changes respectively (""green"", ""yellow"", ""yellow""). Therefore, ""bluf"" doesn't directly translate to these colors based on its following word alone.

However, in example 2, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"", which correlates to ""blue"" in the output. But ""lug"" doesn't appear in other examples to confirm this as a pattern.

Looking at examples 4 and 5, we have repeated segments ""zup bluf wif"" and ""bluf zup bluf,"" where the sequence ""zup bluf"" both times leads to ""yellow yellow."" Considering that ""bluf"" is the common word before the output turns ""yellow,"" we can suggest that ""bluf"" is associated with the color ""yellow.""

Nevertheless, the anomaly remains in the first example (""wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green green""), where ""bluf"" is followed by ""green,"" not ""yellow."" But since there is no following word in ""wif dax bluf,"" we might hypothesize that ""bluf"" defaults to ""green"" when it's at the end of the sequence.

Therefore, based on the information provided, a plausible rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" generally corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" except when it is the last word in the sequence, in which case it corresponds to the color ""green.""

So the tentative rule induction for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> yellow (usually), green (when at the end of a sequence)",-1.103309573292,187,bluf
"Based on the examples given where ""bluf"" appears, it seems that ""bluf"" contributes to generating the color ""green"" when preceded by ""dax"" and the color ""red"" when it either follows or is surrounded by ""wif."" When ""bluf"" is preceded by other words like ""zup,"" it does not result in a uniform color, but instead, repeats the color that was generated by the word directly preceding it (e.g., ""yellow"" in the case of ""zup""). Therefore, ""bluf"" appears to act as a color repeater unless it follows ""dax"" where it contributes to ""green,"" or it follows/is surrounded by ""wif,"" where it generates ""red.""

Rule: 
bluf -> color repeater or contributor to color based on context:
- ""dax bluf"" results in ""green""
- ""wif bluf"" or ""bluf wif"" results in ""red""
- otherwise, ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it.",-6.639522610680001,187,bluf
"Observing the input-output pairs, one can notice the following:

1. ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
2. ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
3. ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
4. ""bluf"" translates to different colors based on its position relative to other words.

Further analysis of each input where ""bluf"" is used:

- In ""wif dax bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which is the same color as the previous word ""dax.""

- In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" which again is the same color as ""dax.""

- In ""dax zup bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same color as the preceding word ""zup.""

- In ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow,"" following the color of ""zup.""

- Lastly, in ""wif bluf zup bluf wif,"" the outputs for ""bluf"" are ""red"" when it follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup."" It seems to replicate the color of the word immediately before it.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

- ""bluf"" means ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup.""

2. No example contains ""bluf"" alone without a preceding word whose output color can be referenced.

- Finally, when ""dax walm wif bluf"" is input, the output is ""green green green red red,"" suggesting that ""dax"" and ""wif"" are tied to the colors green and red, respectively, and ""bluf"" might be tied to the color red as well.

Given the consistent repetition of colors that correspond with the first word in each input (""dax"" -> ""green"" and ""wif"" -> ""red""), it seems ""walm"" may represent a form of repetition or emphasis on the color associated with the word preceding it.

Considering these observations, the rule seems to be that the word ""wif"" serves to initiate or reset the color sequence, with each subsequent unique word being associated with a specific color in the order they appear.

- The words ""bluf"" and ""zup walm"" appear to correspond to ""red"" and a repetition of ""yellow,"" respectively.

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", I will analyze the correspondence between the input and output in each given example.

Input: wif lug

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

These two examples are identical, both leading to the same output. This suggests that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red,"" given that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" However, we need more data points to confirm this.

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

In this example, ""dax"" is added to the sequence ""wif lug,"" and the output introduces ""green."" Thus, ""dax"" likely translates to ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

In this case, ""bluf"" replaces ""lug,"" and the corresponding output replaces ""blue"" with ""red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""

With this final example, we have three new elements: ""zup"" and ""walm"" are added after ""dax,"" and the output has three instances of ""yellow."" As ""dax"" is still associated with ""green,"" we can deduce that either ""zup,"" ""walm,"" or the combination of both translates to ""yellow.""

- ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" when it follows ""wif.""
- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" and ""walm"" seem to correspond to ""yellow,"" although it isn't clear if one or both words mean ""yellow"" or if they together mean something else.

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Here, we know that ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" and we can see that pattern at the end of the output. The remaining ""yellow red blue"" must correspond to ""zup wif lug."" Since ""lug"" is represented by ""blue"" (as we can tell from other examples), ""wif"" would be ""red."" This further confirms that ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

In this example, it ends with ""zup,"" and the output ends with ""yellow."" ""lug bluf"" corresponds with ""blue blue,"" consistent with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" from previous examples.

In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the output is ""red red red green yellow."" When `walm` appears, the color associated with the words before it turns to ""red."" This might indicate that `walm` sets a pattern or changes the color output to red for all words prior to it in the sequence, but further analysis is needed.

In the second example, ""lug walm zup,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow."" Here, `lug` corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" the output remains ""blue"" but then changes to ""yellow"" for ""zup.""

In the third example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm,"" the output is ""green green green red blue green green green."" The word prior to the first ""walm"" is ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and all the subsequent words also turn to ""green"" until ""walm"" appears again after which it resets to the color corresponding to the word directly following it, ""wif"" which is ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" the output is ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow."" It seems that after ""walm,"" the color becomes yellow, regardless of the words that follow.

In the fifth example, ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" Similar to previous examples, ""walm"" turns the output to the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" but the word ""dax"" following ""walm"" returns to its own color, ""green.""

Considering these examples, we can assert that `walm` changes the output pattern in a specific way. It repeats the color of the word immediately prior to it until a new word appears. After that, the color resets to the default color for the next word.

Rule: walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, until a new word appears.",-0.821558835014,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the different contexts in which it appears and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup Output: red red red green yellow
   - Here, ""wif"" is followed by ""red"" and ""dax"" is followed by ""green"". ""zup"" always yields ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug walm zup Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" is followed by ""green"", ""wif"" by ""red"", and ""lug"" by ""blue"".

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - The sequence does not change the established pattern, and the final ""walm"" results in a ""yellow"", which is typically the output for ""zup"".

5. Input: lug walm dax Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" is followed by ""blue"", and ""dax"" by ""green"".

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

- When ""walm"" follows a word, it changes the output color to match the output color of the word it follows. ""walm"" has no independent color but rather mirrors the color assigned to the previous word in the input. However, when ""walm"" becomes the last word in the sequence or is followed by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> mirrors the output color of the preceding word, unless it is followed by ""zup"" or is the last word, in which case the output is yellow.",-7.771529631273002,189,walm
"To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output to see if we can identify a pattern:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   In this example, the word ""walm"" is followed by ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color ""green."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   In this example, the word ""walm"" is not followed by ""dax,"" but the output for ""walm"" is still ""blue,"" which is the same color as ""lug.""

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Here, ""walm"" appears twice; once after ""dax"" (and is followed by ""wif"") and once after ""lug"" and before ""dax."" Both instances of ""walm"" yield the color ""green.""

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" appears at the end, following ""zup,"" and it outputs ""yellow,"" which is the color associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") and precedes ""dax."" ""Walm"" outputs the color that is associated with ""lug.""

From examining the examples, it appears that ""walm"" adopts the color corresponding to the word that it follows. If ""walm"" is at the end, it adopts the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""zup."" If it follows ""lug,"" it outputs ""blue,"" and if it follows ""dax,"" it outputs ""green,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> adopts the color of the preceding word (or the word that precedes ""zup"" if ""walm"" is at the end).",-7.855407488602999,189,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we'll look at each instance and see how it correlates with the output color sequence.

Analyzing the input and corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup        -> Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: lug walm zup             -> Output: blue blue blue yellow
3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm      -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: lug walm dax              -> Output: blue blue blue green

We can infer the following:

- In examples 1 and 2, ""walm"" is directly followed by ""zup,"" correlating to ""red red red green yellow"" and ""blue blue blue yellow"" respectively. ""Zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow,"" so we can't deduce the meaning of ""walm"" solely from this pattern.
- In example 3, ""walm"" occurs twice and is surrounded by different words. Both instances of ""walm"" correspond to the color ""green."" Since ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green"" and is present before the first ""walm"" and after the second ""walm,"" there might be a link that ""walm"" follows the same rule as ""dax.""
- In example 4, ""walm"" is at the end and the output ends with ""yellow yellow yellow,"" corresponding to ""zup walm."" Since we know ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" ""walm"" in this case would also mean ""yellow.""
- In example 5, ""walm"" again directly precedes ""dax,"" and both correspond to ""blue blue blue green.""

Looking at the consistency across the examples:

- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the color before ""walm"" is replicated in the output. For example, in 1: ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red green,"" showing that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it. This is consistent in 2 and 5 where ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"" in both cases.
- However, in example 3, ""walm"" is followed by the output ""green"" both times, while ""dax"" (which precedes ""walm"") also maps to ""green."" This could indicate that ""walm"" adopts the color of the preceding word but is not a color itself.

Based on these observations, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> adopts the color of the preceding word in the sequence. 

This means that ""walm"" is not a specific color but rather a placeholder that takes on the color of the word that comes before it.",-7.949810802413998,189,walm
"To induce the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the input-output pairs and identify any patterns that could explain how each input word corresponds to each color in the output.

Let's analyze the color outputs following instances of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup 
   Output: red red red green yellow
   
2. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm 
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

4. Input: lug wif dax zup walm 
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm dax 
   Output: blue blue blue green

Observations:
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or ""dax,"" the color output for ""walm"" matches the color that precedes it. We can see it in the first, third, and fifth examples where we have ""red red red,"" ""green green green,"" and ""blue blue blue,"" respectively.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""zup,"" the output color for ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" takes on the preceding color (seen in the second and first example).
- In example 4, ""walm"" occurs at the end and its output color is yellow, which is different from the preceding color (green for ""zup"").
- It seems when ""walm"" is not followed by any word, it defaults to yellow as seen in the last output of the fourth input.

From these observations, the tentative rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it takes on the color output of the preceding word unless it is followed by ""zup"" or it is the last word, in which case the output is yellow.

- The fourth example doesn't introduce new words but shows the order affects the output: ""zup walm wif"" translates as ""yellow yellow yellow red,"" once again with ""walm"" causing the preceding color to be repeated three times.
- Finally, in the fifth example, ""lug walm dax"" leads to ""blue blue blue green,"" which implies that ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated thrice, but ""dax"" remains as ""green"" with no repetitions since it is not followed by ""walm.""

- When ""dax"" is repeated, the word ""green"" repeats the same number of times (""dax zup dax"" -> ""green yellow green"").
- A single ""dax"" corresponds to a single ""green"" (""dax"" -> ""green"").
- When ""dax"" precedes another word, ""walm,"" which appears to correspond to repeating ""green,"" the number of repetitions of ""green"" corresponds to the total number of words (""dax walm"" => three words -> ""green green green"").
- ""dax"" followed by ""lug walm"" results in ""green"" followed by three ""blue,"" the number of ""blue"" again corresponding to the total number of words following ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green

This rule seems to apply regardless of the position of ""dax"" in a sequence, making ""dax"" a consistent representation for the color green.",-3.22251557548,192,dax
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green."" The number of syllables in the following words might determine the repetition of the color. For example, ""walm"" has one syllable and results in ""green"" being output three times, and ""lug"" has one syllable, resulting in ""blue"" being repeated four times (as in the fourth example).

So, the general rule for ""dax"" seems to be that when ""dax"" is mentioned before one-syllable nonce words, it outputs ""green"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word, repeated for the number of syllables plus one.

For example:
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green"" followed by ""green"" repeated three times because ""walm"" has one syllable.
- ""dax lug"" produces ""green"" followed by ""blue"" repeated four times because ""lug"" has one syllable.

If no word follows ""dax"" or the following word does not influence color repetition, ""dax"" simply outputs ""green.""

""zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""yellow"" both times.

Input: zup lug

Example 2:

Here, the first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and so does the second ""zup.""

Example 5:

- ""wif dax bluf"" translates to ""red green green"" because ""dax"" (green) precedes ""bluf.""
- ""lug wif dax bluf wif lug"" translates to ""blue red green green red blue"" because ""dax"" precedes the first ""bluf"" and ""wif"" precedes the second ""bluf.""

2. ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
3. ""zup walm lug"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue""
4. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> ""red green yellow yellow yellow""
5. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""

We notice that each time ""walm"" appears, it corresponds to three successive identical color outputs. For example:
- In the first line, ""lug walm dax wif"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue green red."" Here, ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue.""
- In the third line, ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" And here again, ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

The pattern suggests that the nonce word ""walm"" invokes a repetition of whatever color corresponds to the word immediately preceding it, repeating that color output three times. 

We can formulate the rule as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.",-1.1351521248599998,192,walm

2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif dax zup walm"" translates to ""red green yellow yellow yellow""

In each instance, ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color word that precedes it three times.

- In the third example: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" is associated with yellow and the rule still applies.
- In the fourth example: ""zup walm"" again results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" further supporting the rule.
- In the fifth example: ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" which again fits the rule.

According to the provided examples, ""walm"" serves as an instruction to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times in the output.",-5.927271994100001,192,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to first identify any patterns associated with its use in the given examples. Let's analyze each input and its corresponding output:

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   Pattern: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and again ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of ""yellow"" before ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Pattern: ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""yellow"" associated with ""zup.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Pattern: ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and again ""walm"" leads to a repetition of ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

- In the second string, ""lug dax"" becomes ""blue green."" Considering the previous example, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and hence ""dax"" must be ""green.""

"To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's first identify the pattern of outputs corresponding to the given examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue."" This suggests that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be related to a repetition of the preceding color or a transformation rule.
  
- In the second example, ""dax walm wif walm"" results in ""green green green red red red."" Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" appears to repeat the color preceding it multiple times before ""wif"" changes the output to red.

- The third example, ""zup wif walm,"" yields ""yellow red red red."" ""Zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" and after the ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in a repetition of ""red"" instead of ""yellow.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug walm,"" the result is ""red blue blue blue."" Since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""lug"" (""blue""), the ""walm"" here repeats ""blue"" multiple times.

- The fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm,"" results in ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow."" Given that each color word corresponds to a color (""zup"" to ""yellow""), ""walm"" again seems to repeat the previously mentioned color (""yellow"" in this case) multiple times.

Putting together these observations, ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color multiple times until another color or a potential stop word (""wif"") is encountered.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color mentioned until a different color word or a stop word is encountered.",-1.010204596284,193,walm
"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to represent a rule where the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" is repeated three times. Let's verify this with the examples:

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""lug walm,"" we get three blues.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""dax walm,"" we see three greens. Then ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""wif walm"" leads to three reds.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" gives us red. After ""wif walm,"" there are three reds.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
Rule: ""wif"" gives us red, ""lug"" gives us blue, and ""lug walm"" leads to three blues.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Rule: ""wif"" gives us red, ""zup"" gives us yellow, ""lug"" gives us blue, ""dax"" gives us green, and ""zup walm"" results in three yellows.

This analysis leads us to the following rule: 

walm -> Causes the color of the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.",-5.846803170738999,193,walm
"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"", we should examine how the outputs change in relation to its presence and position in the input.

- In both the first and the fourth examples, there is a repetition of a color whenever ""walm"" follows another word (e.g., ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue"" and ""wif lug walm"" leads to ""red blue blue blue""). This could imply that ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word.

- However, in the second example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in ""red red red"" rather than ""green green green"". Furthermore, in the third example, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" instead of ""red red"". And lastly, in the fifth example, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" rather than just ""yellow yellow"".

Considering these observations, it seems that ""walm"" does not simply repeat the preceding color. Instead, ""walm"" appears to cause the repetition of the last color mentioned, but it might also be changing the number of repetitions based on context.

Given the frequency of the color repetitions, it seems ""walm"" repeats the last color mentioned three times when it is the second word in the input sequence, but when it's not the second word, it causes the repetition of the preceding color one fewer times than its position in the sequence (e.g., in the fifth example, ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"", ""walm"" is the sixth word, so ""yellow"" is repeated twice because ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup""). 

However, the varying behavior of ""walm"" based on its position and neighboring words suggests its rule might not be so straightforward. Still, the consistent element is the repetition of a color and the propensity to repeat the last color mentioned. Hence, the most consistent rule that fits all the examples is that ""walm"" repeats the last mentioned color thrice.

- In the fourth example, ""lug walm,"" since ""lug"" corresponds to blue and is followed by ""walm,"" it leads to three blues.
- In the fifth example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""bluf"" is not demonstrated in the input but results in one blue output, which either indicates the color for ""bluf"" is the same as for ""lug"" (blue), or that the additional blue is part of ""walm""'s effect and ""bluf"" is not represented in the output.

5. ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", but does not influence the color that follows it, unless it is the starting word.
6. ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" in the output, implying a one-to-one correspondence regardless of its position.
7. When ""bluf"" follows a ""zup"", it turns into ""yellow"", indicating that ""zup"" might affect the following word's output.

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and results in the same color as ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

From these examples, we can ascertain that ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

"Based on the provided examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"". By examining how ""wif"" is used in relation to other words and their corresponding outputs, we can determine its meaning.

Here are the observations from the examples:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" occurs between ""lug"" and ""lug"" and also between ""walm"" and ""walm"". ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and ""walm"" correlates with ""yellow."" Following a ""wif"", ""blue"" becomes ""red"" and ""yellow"" also becomes ""red"".

2. In the second example, ""wif"" is given alone and the output is ""red"".

3. In the third example, ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""lug"" with ""blue"". Following ""wif"", ""blue"" appears as ""red"" again, and ""dax"" correlates with ""green"".

4. In the fourth example, ""dax"" before ""wif"" leads to ""green"", and then ""red"" follows after ""wif"".

5. In the fifth example, we once again see that ""wif"" is followed by ""red"", while ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Based on these observations, every time ""wif"" appears, regardless of the context, the output is ""red"". No words after or before ""wif"" seem to affect this; the output for ""wif"" remains constant. Therefore, we can deduce that:

"Given the input and output pairs, it appears that ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, the color name is repeated once in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""wif bluf"" becomes ""red red"" because ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", hence ""red"" is repeated.
- ""lug wif bluf"" becomes ""blue red red"" because ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red"" being repeated.
- ""dax bluf"" becomes ""green green"" because ""dax"" is ""green"" and it's followed by ""bluf"".
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" becomes ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue"". In this case, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" has not been seen before but corresponds to ""yellow"" and is repeated because of ""bluf"", and ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue"", indicating that ""walm"" might have a rule of its own, possibly indicating a duplication of the color that follows it.

- Input: lug wif bluf — Output: blue red red (The color red associated with ""wif"" is repeated.)
- Input: dax bluf — Output: green green (The color green associated with ""dax"" is repeated.)
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm — Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue (The color yellow associated with ""zup"" is repeated, followed by the repeated blue for ""lug."")
- Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue (The color blue associated with ""lug"" is repeated.)

Thus, the rule appears to be:

"Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern correlating the nonce word ""bluf"" with the repetition of color words in the Output. Here's the pattern we observe:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" seems to indicate that the color word ""red"" is to be repeated.

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Rule: Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" appears to repeat the previous color word which is ""red"" in this context.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and just like the previous examples, ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of ""green"".

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
Rule: The pattern continues as ""wif"" means ""red"", ""zup"" means ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" implies the repetition of ""yellow"". ""Lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""walm"" possibly indicates repeating the color that comes before it (""blue"" in this case), much like ""bluf"".

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
Rule: Consistent with the other examples, ""lug"" means ""blue"" and ""bluf"" suggests that ""blue"" be repeated.

These observations lead us to formulate the following rule for ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" signals that the color word immediately preceding it should be repeated in the Output.

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated in the output.",-4.676773723959,196,bluf

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

When ""bluf"" is used after these words, the color mentioned in the Output is duplicated. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color associated with the preceding word in the Output sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word.",-5.59205234154,196,bluf

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and outputs that color twice.",-6.6284256455,196,bluf
"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look for patterns associated with it in various examples. Let's analyze the input and corresponding output sequences to infer the rule.

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" -> ""green green green red blue green green green""
   Here, the word ""walm"" is followed by one ""green"" before the next word and then two ""greens"" before any occurrence of the word ""dax.""

2. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
   ""Walm"" follows ""lug"" here without a preceding ""dax,"" and we see three ""blue"" colors in the output.

3. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> ""yellow red green green green blue""
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""lug,"" resulting in two ""green"" colors followed by ""blue.""

4. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
   ""Walm"" directly follows ""dax"" without any words after it, leading to two ""green"" colors in the output.

5. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue red""
   ""Walm"" precedes ""lug"" without a ""dax"" before it, resulting in ""blue"" in the output.

Based on the analysis:

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the output generates two ""green"" colors.
- When ""walm"" is the last word after ""dax,"" there is an extra ""green"" afterward.
- When ""walm"" precedes ""lug"" without a preceding ""dax,"" it results in a ""blue"" color.

Rule: ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in two instances of ""green"" in the output, with an additional ""green"" if it's the last word. ""Walm"" before ""lug"" without a preceding ""dax"" results in ""blue.""

Applying this rule, we can summarize the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: A modifier that, when following the word ""dax,"" produces two ""green"" outputs, with an additional ""green"" if it is the last word. When preceding ""lug"" without ""dax"" before it, it produces ""blue.""",-1.122118921158,196,walm
"Given the examples, let's observe the pattern around the usage of ""walm"" and how it affects the output.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" both times it appears.
   - ""walm"" appears twice, and both times it results in a repetition of the color associated with the word before it ""green green green"" and then again ""green green green"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" 
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" 
   - ""walm"" results in a repetition of the previous color ""blue"" three more times.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" two more times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green"" two more times.

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow"" two more times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

From these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately before it to be repeated three times.

Hence, walm -> causes the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three times.",-7.0166582869119996,196,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs based on the examples provided. We will look at the position of ""walm"" and how the outputs change in its presence:

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" appears twice and both times it is followed by three ""green"" outputs
   
2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" appears once and it is followed by three ""blue"" (same as ""lug"")
   
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" results in three ""green"" after the word ""dax""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" alone is followed by two additional ""green""
   
5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" is followed by two additional ""yellow"" (same as ""zup"")

From these examples, we can observe that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it twice more in the output. For instance, in examples 1 and 3, when ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") comes before ""walm,"" the result is three ""green"" colors in the output. Similarly, in example 5, when ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") comes before ""walm,"" the result is three ""yellow"" colors in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two more times in the output. 

Using this rule:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word two additional times in the output.",-7.241860278188,196,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look at how the output changes with the inclusion or omission of the word ""walm"" in various inputs.

Notice when ""walm"" is included after ""dax,"" the color green is repeated three times. When ""walm"" is not present, the word ""dax"" only outputs a single green.

Here are the observations:

1. ""dax walm"" always results in ""green green green.""
2. ""dax"" without ""walm"" just results in ""green.""
3. The presence of other words does not affect the triple repetition: ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" still results in multiple sequences of ""green green green"" corresponding to each ""dax walm.""
4. ""walm"" also seems to cause preceding words to repeat their output color: ""zup walm lug wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue red.""

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""walm"" causes the color output of the word immediately before it to repeat three times. If there is no word before ""walm,"" there is no color to repeat, which we don't have evidence for from the provided examples.

The third example directly follows this pattern, with ""zup dax lug"" being translated to ""yellow green blue.""

In the fourth example, ""zup"" is once again the first word and translates to ""yellow."" ""Bluf lug"" follows it and is translated as ""yellow blue.""

The final example places ""zup"" as the last word and still translates to ""yellow,"" following ""wif bluf lug,"" which is translated as ""red red blue.""

"To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look at the patterns in each input and the corresponding outputs.

Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: lug dax walm wif

   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""green"" (following ""dax"")
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" appears to continue the color preceding it

2. Input: zup wif dax walm

   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" appears to continue the color ""green"" again

3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" appears to continue the color ""yellow"" this time (following ""zup"")

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" continues the color ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Seeing the pattern, ""walm"" seems to repeat or continue the color of the word directly preceding it. Whether it's ""lug,"" ""dax,"" or ""zup"" before ""walm,"" it takes the color corresponding to that word and repeats it until a new word/color appears.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.",-6.0222401273249995,197,walm
"To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at each instance to see how it fits into the sequence of colors in the output.

If we consider the first input-output pair:

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red

After ""walm"" is used, the subsequent words yield the color green, except for ""wif,"" which changes the pattern and results in red.

Now, examining the second input-output pair:

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

Here, ""walm"" is at the end again, and this time ""dax"" precedes it directly without any word in between, resulting in green.

Let's also examine the next pairs:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

In this case, the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" and afterward, the colors repeat yellow until the word ""lug"" appears again.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the color sequence is blue thereafter.

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

The presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of yellow until the sequence is broken by ""dax"" and ""lug.""

The common rule across all sequences seems to be that once ""walm"" is mentioned, the following colors repeat the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" until a new color word is introduced or the sequence ends.

3. Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

2. Input: dax wif lug => Output: green red blue

From these examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the output of ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red",-6.259756074249001,198,wif
"To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in each of the examples provided.

1. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
2. Input: dax wif lug | Output: green red blue
3. Input: wif bluf lug zup | Output: red red blue yellow

"Through analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the following word to be repeated in the output, with an associated color as the repeated word.

Let's break down the instances:

1. zup bluf -> yellow yellow (The word following ""bluf"" is repeated, and ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"".)
2. wif bluf -> red red (Same pattern, ""wif"" is translated to ""red"".)
3. dax bluf wif zup dax -> green green red yellow green (The pattern holds for ""dax"" as ""green"", and the other color words appear in sequence.)
4. lug bluf -> blue blue (Here ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"", which is repeated.)
5. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red (The same pattern, with ""walm"" possibly being another color word that repeats ""red"".)

Since ""bluf"" is not causing any transformation on the words themselves but seems to affect the structure of the output by duplicating the subsequent word and its color translation, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" causes the immediately following word to be repeated twice in the output, with the word translated into its corresponding color name. If the color of a word is unknown, it repeats the prior word's color.

Thus:

bluf -> Meaning: Repeat the next word twice in the output, represented as its corresponding color.",-1.169585025408,198,bluf

Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color represented by that word, repeated twice.

- zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- wif bluf -> red red
- dax bluf -> green green
- lug bluf -> blue blue

In the case where ""bluf"" is followed by another word that is not repeated, such as ""walm,"" which outputs red, the pattern of repetition does not continue, and the standard color associated with the new word follows.

- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

Based on the given examples, the rule for bluf is: bluf -> Causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated.",-2.14041331652,198,bluf
"Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a rule for repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it. Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Here's the observed pattern:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
- The addition of the word ""bluf"" after these words leads to the repetition of their corresponding color in the output.
- The word ""walm"" in the last example does not have a preceding ""bluf,"" but it corresponds to the color ""red"" as well, possibly indicating that it follows the color of the preceding item when ""bluf"" is not present to enforce a double repetition.

"bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: When used after another word, bluf indicates that the color corresponding to the previous word should be repeated. Here is the breakdown of the examples provided:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""bluf"" after ""wif"" results in ""red red"".
- In the sequence ""dax bluf wif zup dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so the pair is ""green green"". Then ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""dax"" is green again.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue, so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue"".
- In the sequence ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow, so the pair is ""yellow yellow"". ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" seems to act independently and also corresponds to red.",-3.4561982755400003,198,bluf
"Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the following word's associated color output to be repeated once. 

Explanation:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue"".

In the ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", we see ""green green,"" consistent with the previous rule where the associated color of the word following ""bluf"" is repeated once. However, since there is no word after ""bluf"" for ""wif"" and ""zup,"" those colors are not repeated, and instead, they follow the normal pattern (one instance per word). 

Following the consistent pattern in all given examples, ""bluf"" causes the next word to have its associated color output repeated once. If there is no word after ""bluf"" (as in the case of ""lug bluf""), the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" is simply repeated once knowing that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". 

With the last input, ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""bluf"" causes the next color (which is red for ""wif"") to be repeated, resulting in ""red"" repeated twice. ""Walm"" could likely mean an action to repeat the color associated with the previous word (in this case, ""wif"" which is ""red"") two more times, although there's not enough data to confirm the rule for ""walm"" without seeing more examples.

This rule is consistent with all given data, though there's an element of uncertainty with the last part of the final example, which includes the word ""walm"" not previously explained.",-4.01082431147,198,bluf
"Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a series of color outputs that reflect the last non-walm word's corresponding color repeated multiple times. In each example, after the word ""walm"" is introduced, the color that is outputted is the same as the color of the last word before ""walm,"" and this color repeats for a number of times (variable across examples).

Here is the breakdown of each input-output mapping:

1. dax -> green; walm -> yellow yellow yellow (as ""zup"" is equivalent to ""yellow"")
2. lug -> blue; walm -> blue blue blue (as ""lug"" is equivalent to ""blue"")
3. wif -> red; walm -> red red red (as ""wif"" is equivalent to ""red"")
4. dax -> green; walm -> green green green (as ""dax"" is equivalent to ""green"")
5. lug -> blue; walm -> blue blue blue (as ""lug"" is equivalent to ""blue"")

It seems that the repetition count of the color may also depend on the context or sequence of words preceding ""walm,"" not just on the immediately preceding color word. However, there isn't enough data to provide a more specific pattern related to repetition count.

Rule: walm -> a series of the same color words, with the color being that of the immediately preceding non-walm word, repeated multiple times.",-5.321754309226,198,walm
"Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correspond to multiple repetitions of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here is the rationale:

1. In the first example, ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow,"" and when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is three ""yellow"" colors in a row.
2. In the second example, ""lug"" becomes ""blue,"" then ""walm"" results in three ""blue"" colors in a row.
3. Similarly, in the third example, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and following ""walm,"" there are three ""red"" colors.
4. The fourth example has ""dax"" as ""green,"" and ""walm"" after ""dax"" produces three ""green"" colors, followed by ""wif"" which is translated to ""red.""
5. The final example has only ""lug"" followed by ""walm,"" again yielding three repetitions of ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the last color word to be repeated three times in the output. Thus, ""walm"" can be defined as causing a tripling effect of the color word that comes before it.

"To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we can compare the input sequences with their corresponding outputs and look for patterns. Here's the input-output breakdown:

- Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
- Input: zup dax bluf zup dax -> Output: yellow green green yellow green
- Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
- Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue yellow red red green
- Input: dax zup dax walm -> Output: green yellow green green green

Analyzing the patterns, we can observe:

- ""dax"" appears after ""zup"" and ""green"" follows ""yellow"" consistently, which may indicate that ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"" when following ""zup.""
- When ""dax"" is placed at the beginning of the input sequence, the output always starts with ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears alone with other words that do not repeat, such as in the second case of the third example (""bluf zup dax"") or at the end of the sequence like in the fourth example, the output again contains ""green.""

From these observations, it seems that ""dax"" by itself translates into ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.

"Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". When ""wif"" appears on its own, the output is simply ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is:

"Based on the provided examples, here is the rule deduction for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"":

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   
   Here, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and the output is ""red yellow"".

2. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   Here, ""wif"" is standalone and the output is just ""red"".

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   
   Here, ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green red"". 

4. Input: wif zup lug wif
   Output: red yellow blue red
   
   Here, ""wif"" appears both at the beginning and at the end of the input sequence. The output begins with ""red"" and ends with ""red"", corresponding to the positions of ""wif"". The words ""zup"" and ""lug"" in the middle correspond to ""yellow"" and ""blue"", respectively.

5. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

   As noted in the third example, ""dax"" followed by ""wif"" maintains the output ""green red"".

Based on these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It appears that ""wif"" is a standalone representation of the color red when it is the only word present or the first word in a sequence, and it retains that representation even when it follows or is followed by other words.

"Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correlate with a color switch in the pattern of output colors. When ""bluf"" is encountered, the subsequent color in the output seems to change from the current color to the next in a specific sequence. To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we must analyze the transition of colors before and after ""bluf"" appears.

In the first example:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

In the second example:
- Before ""bluf"" appears for the first time, the last color mentioned is ""green,"" and it's then followed by ""red.""
- Before ""bluf"" appears for the second time, the last color mentioned is ""yellow,"" and it's then followed by ""blue.""

In the third example:
- Before ""bluf,"" we see ""green,"" and it's followed by ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

In the fifth example:
- The last color before ""bluf"" is ""green,"" and it's followed by ""red.""

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" indicates a shift from the previous color to the next one in a fixed sequence, rather than representing a color directly. The sequence that can be derived from the examples is as follows:
- yellow -> green -> blue -> red

Thus, whenever ""bluf"" occurs, the next color in the output will be the one following the most recent color in the sequence. The fact that ""bluf"" by itself results in ""red red"" in the fourth example suggests that when not following a previously established color, ""bluf"" may default to ""red.""

From this information, we can create the following rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" indicates a change to the next color in the sequence from the last mentioned color before ""bluf,"" following the sequence yellow -> green -> blue -> red. If ""bluf"" is the first color-indicating term in the sequence or not preceded by a color-indicating term, it defaults to ""red.""",-9.93206126816,199,bluf

"To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we must observe its relation to the color outputs in each example. Let's examine the color sequence that follows ""walm"" compared to the words preceding it:

1. wif zup walm dax zup -> red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
2. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
5. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:
Whenever the word ""walm"" appears, the color that follows is a repeat of the color that appeared just before ""walm,"" continuing for three repetitions before moving back to the regular sequence.

Now, let's translate this observation into the rule:
Rule: When ""walm"" occurs in the input, it causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output sequence.",-1.225345013066,199,walm
"To determine the meaning or rule behind ""walm,"" we must look for a pattern in the given examples. Since the color output seems to correspond to the sequence of words before it, we need to figure out how ""walm"" affects the colors.

Looking at the examples:

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" correlates to red, while ""zup"" correlates to yellow. After ""walm,"" we see a sequence of yellows except when encountering ""dax,"" which correlates to green. ""Walm"" does not seem to correlate with a static color but affects the color choice for the words following it.

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
- Here, ""dax"" again starts with green, ""lug"" with blue. After ""walm,"" ""zup"" which would normally be yellow is now blue, just like ""lug"" before it. ""Wif"" returns to red as if ""walm's"" influence has ended.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""Zup"" maps to yellow and ""wif"" to red, as seen consistently. After ""walm,"" the output is red (associated with ""wif"") three times, suggesting that ""walm"" might repeat the color associated with the word before it.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Following ""walm,"" we have ""dax"" which maps to green regularly, but before ""walm"" the sequence of ""zup"" which maps to yellow is repeated.

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color that follows to match the color of the word that precedes ""walm."" The influence of ""walm"" stops when a new color sequence begins or probably at the end of the list of words. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color associated with the previous word for all subsequent words until a change occurs (either a different word-color pair appears or the sequence ends).

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.",-6.974919878976667,199,walm
"To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each example and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow yellow green"" which corresponds to the colors following ""dax zup"" in the input.
   
2. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue blue yellow"" which corresponds to the colors following ""lug zup"" in the input.
   
3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

   Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""red red"" which corresponds to the colors following ""wif"" in the input.
   
4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

   Here, ""walm"" is proceeded by ""yellow yellow green,"" and these colors correspond to the items following ""dax wif"" in the input.
   
5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

   Here, ""walm"" has ""blue blue"" after it, which corresponds to the colors after ""lug"" in the input.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the immediately preceding word in the sequence. Therefore, after ""walm"" is introduced, the next colors are duplications of the color associated with the word just before ""walm."" ""walm"" itself does not have a direct color association; instead, its function is to repeat the sequence of colors that starts from the word just before it.

"From the given examples, it is observed that every instance of the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the same color that precedes it, except when a new color word (""wif"" or ""dax"" for red and green, respectively) appears and changes the sequence.

walm -> repeat the color that comes before it, until a new color word is mentioned.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, it causes the color sequence to repeat the preceding color, continuing this repetition until the sequence is interrupted by another color word (such as ""wif"" or ""dax"").",-9.82103568994,199,walm
