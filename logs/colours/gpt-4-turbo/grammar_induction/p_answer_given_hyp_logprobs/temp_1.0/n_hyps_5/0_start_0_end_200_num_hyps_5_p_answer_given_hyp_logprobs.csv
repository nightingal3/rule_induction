    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in the provided output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"":

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

In each instance where the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we must look for patterns in its appearance relative to the output colors. We will analyze the relationship between the input, which includes ""zup,"" and the corresponding output. 

1. Input: ""dax walm zup lug"" -> Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
2. Input: ""dax zup lug bluf"" -> Output: ""green yellow blue blue""
3. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup"" -> Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
4. Input: ""lug zup"" -> Output: ""blue yellow""
5. Input: ""dax zup wif"" -> Output: ""green yellow red""

Observations:

- Whenever other non-zup words are used, they seem to consistently translate to specific colors (e.g., ""dax"" always translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"").
- The color ""yellow"" is associated with ""zup"" in every output where ""zup"" is present, suggesting a direct translation.
- In the sequence where ""zup"" is the first and last word (Input 3), it translates to ""yellow"" at both the beginning and the end, meaning it is not positionally dependent.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the pattern indicates that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it. Here is the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of ""zup,"" which is yellow.
- In the second example, ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red."" Here ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" takes on this green value. 
- In the third example, ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red,"" which again demonstrates that ""bluf"" takes on the value of ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug bluf"" yields ""yellow blue blue,"" indicating that ""bluf"" assumes the value of ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In the fifth example, ""lug bluf wif"" translates to ""blue blue red,"" where ""bluf"" takes on the color value of ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word 'walm' causes the color word that precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

- In the first example, 'lug' (which corresponds with 'blue') is followed by 'walm', and the output is 'blue' repeated three times.
- In the second example, 'dax' (which corresponds with 'green') is followed by 'walm', and 'green' is repeated three times in the output.
- In the third and fourth examples, 'walm' follows 'wif' (which corresponds with 'red'), and the output is 'red' repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, 'lug' precedes the first 'walm' resulting in 'blue' repeated three times, and 'zup' precedes the second 'walm' resulting in 'yellow' repeated three times.

Based on these observations, we can deduce:

walm -> Repeats the preceding color three times.

Rule: If a color word is immediately followed by the word 'walm', output that color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Considering the provided examples where ""wif"" features in multiple contexts and its output, we can deduce the following:

Input: wif
Output: red
- ""wif"" on its own corresponds to the color red.

Input: lug wif dax
Output: blue red green
- When ""lug"" appears, the output is blue; when ""wif"" appears, the output is red; and when ""dax"" appears, the output is green.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- When ""zup"" appears, the output is yellow; ""wif"" is consistently giving the output red; ""walm"" seems to expand to three instances of red.

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- ""lug"" continues to map to blue; ""wif"" to red; ""bluf"" seems to produce an additional instance of red.

Input: wif zup lug wif
Output: red yellow blue red
- ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, and ""wif"" is again red.

Based on this analysis, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequences, it consistently maps to ""red"". The rule:
wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently associated with the output color ""yellow."" There is no instance in which ""zup"" corresponds to any other color. Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each occurrence of the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" replicates the color word that directly precedes it. So, when ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"". Similarly, when ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color yellow) is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"". Additionally, when there is no color word before ""bluf"" (as in the last example), ""bluf"" itself seems to default to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color word that precedes it. If there is no preceding color word, it defaults to ""yellow"".
Analyzing the provided examples, let's attempt to deduce the rule or meaning behind the nonce word 'walm'. As we look at the inputs and their corresponding outputs, we will look for patterns associated with 'walm'.

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - 'walm' comes after 'lug' and results in a blue followed by a green.
   
2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   - 'walm' comes after 'wif' and results in a red followed by colors for 'lug' and 'zup'.
   
3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - 'walm' comes after 'dax' leading to green, and the sequence of 'walm' 'zup' 'lug' 'walm' leads to green yellow blue blue blue.
   
4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - 'walm' comes after 'dax' (green) and is followed by greens.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   - 'walm' comes after a sequence of colors that ends with yellow.

From these examples, we can make several observations:
- 'walm' seems to result in a repetition of the last color mentioned before 'walm' if it is placed after 'dax', 'wif', or 'lug'.
- However, if 'walm' is followed by other words, the pattern does not seem to strictly apply as it might depend on the sequence that follows.

Given these observations, a potential rule for 'walm' is as follows:

Rule: When 'walm' is used after a color word (like 'dax', 'wif', or 'lug'), it appears to continue the sequence with the last mentioned color. If 'walm' is followed by a sequence of words, the pattern of the output colors adapts to include that sequence.

Therefore, the meaning behind 'walm' seems to be a rule that involves repeating or continuing the color pattern based on its position and neighboring words in the sequence. The exact pattern may vary depending on the sequence that follows 'walm'.

Given the complexity and variability of the patterns, there is no single word that 'walm' directly translates to, but rather it follows the rule as described above.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the most recent color mentioned or continues the color pattern based on its sequence context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green
To identify the rule for ""wif,"" let's look at each input-output pair and see how they correspond:

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

3. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red

4. Input: dax wif zup
   Output: green red yellow

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow

Let's examine any patterns associated with ""wif"":

- Every time ""wif"" occurs in the input, ""red"" occurs in the output.
- The occurrence of ""wif"" does not seem to change based on its position in the input sequence.

Other words correspond to different colors based on their occurrence in the sequences:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of the color directly before it (""walm"" following ""lug"" -> ""blue blue,"" following ""wif"" -> ""red red"").

The consistent output regardless of position or adjacent words suggests ""wif"" translates directly to a color without additional context needed.

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""zup"" can be directly identified as a translation from the nonce word ""zup"" to a color in the sequences presented. In all instances where ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is the corresponding color in the same position in the output. Thus, we can determine the following:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> duplicate the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another color-indicating word, it repeats that color twice in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" based on the given examples, let's first look for patterns in the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif - Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
2. Input: zup wif walm lug - Output: yellow red red red blue
3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif - Output: yellow green green green yellow red
4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm - Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup - Output: green red red red blue yellow

Looking at each example where ""walm"" appears, the color that follows it corresponds to the color that precedes it in the input. For instance, in the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and is translated to blue, and the next color after ""walm"" is also blue. This same pattern can be observed in all other examples.

Thus, we can infer the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the preceding word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
From the given examples, we can attempt to derive the meaning of ""dax"" by analyzing the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Here's what we have from the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax
   Output: green
   - The single input ""dax"" corresponds to the single output ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue
   - When ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   - When ""dax"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it still translates to ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm lug"" and translates to ""green green green blue.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" it seems to repeat the ""green"" three times.

Accounting for the last two points, it seems like ""walm"" might be a modifier that makes the word before it repeat three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""dax,"" consistent across all given examples, is simply ""green."" It seems that ""dax"" does not change meaning based on position or surrounding words, except for the repetition induced by ""walm"" after it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it. This suggests that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red"" and is not influenced by context.

Rule: wif -> red.
By analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

- The sequence ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" results in a yellow after two occurrences of red.
- However, ""zup"" doesn't always translate to ""yellow,"" as seen from subsequent examples. Thus, its meaning might be context-dependent.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

- Here, ""zup"" appears at the beginning of the sequence and still translates to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

- ""wif"" preceded by ""zup"" translates to ""red yellow"" instead of ""red red,"" indicating that ""zup"" might not have a fixed corresponding color.
- But it follows red again and yields yellow.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

- Again, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and yields yellow, consistent with previous instances.

Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

- Here, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and it results in ""yellow.""

Considering these examples, we can hypothesize that ""zup"" means ""yellow,"" but its presence seems to influence or change the color that would normally follow it. However, after further inspection, we notice that ""zup"" is always followed by yellow, regardless of the color that precedes it.

Rule: zup -> translates to yellow, regardless of the preceding color.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" is consistently translated to ""red"" across all examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to find a consistent pattern that explains the output for each instance of ""walm"" in the examples provided. Let's first list out the examples with their corresponding outputs to see if we can find a pattern:

Input: wif lug walm | Output: red blue blue blue
Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
Input: zup dax walm | Output: yellow green green green
Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow

Upon examination, the inputs that contain ""walm"" are consistent in producing a repetition of the color that immediately precedes ""walm” in the output, three times. Here's the pattern seen with ""walm"":

1. In the first example, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the result is three repetitions of the color ""blue"" after the color that corresponds to ""lug"".
2. In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""wif” (ignoring the last ""dax"" for now), and the output showed three successive ""green"" which correspond to ""dax,"" followed by a ""red"" corresponding to ""wif"".
3. In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" respectively, and in both cases, we see three repetitions of the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"".
4. In the last example, ""walm"" directly follows ""zup"", and the output is three ""yellow"", which is the color corresponding to ""zup"".

From these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" as follows:

walm -> meaning: The word “walm” causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax bluf
    ",Output: red green red,red green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
By examining the provided examples, we can try to infer the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" 

Let's consider the provided input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green
2. Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
3. Input: lug dax zup lug wif -> Output: blue green yellow blue red
4. Input: dax -> Output: green
5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

By observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs with ""dax"":

- In example 1, ""dax"" appears at the end of the input and results in ""green.""
- In example 2, ""dax"" is at the beginning and followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""green blue.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" is in the middle, preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue green yellow.""
- In example 4, the only input is ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""
- In example 5, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and precedes ""zup,"" with the output around it being ""red green yellow.""

From these observations, we see that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax translates to green, irrespective of its context in the sequence. Hence, the rule is:

dax -> green.
Based on the given examples, it appears the nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Every time 'zup' appears, the output is 'yellow'.
- 'wif' consistently outputs 'red'.
- 'dax' consistently outputs 'green'.
- 'lug' consistently outputs 'blue'.
- 'walm' when following 'lug' still translates to 'blue', which suggests it may not alter the translation of 'lug'.

Taking these observations into account, we can deduce that 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf translates to the same color as the preceding word. If the preceding word is ""zup,"" bluf means yellow. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" bluf means blue. There is no example with ""wif"" or ""dax"" followed by bluf.

bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word just before it. The number of repetitions seems to be three, as there are three instances of the color for each occurrence of ""walm.""

The rule for walm is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Therefore, when you see ""walm"" after a word, the meaning is to output the color that corresponds to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue green yellow,blue blue blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of the context in which it appears.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we examine the context in which it appears and the corresponding outputs. The word ""dax"" appears between words that have corresponding colors as outputs:

- wif dax wif -> red green red
- lug dax -> blue green
- zup wif dax wif bluf -> yellow red green red red
- lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow
- wif dax -> red green

It seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, no matter the context. Therefore, the rule can be:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the relationship between inputs and outputs in the given examples.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Assuming ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green."" The last ""wif"" follows ""bluf"" and they both correspond to ""red.""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" not ""green"" as initially assumed.

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" here, which contradicts the previous assumption.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red,"" as evidenced by previous examples.

Observations: 
- The word ""bluf"" shows variability. In some cases, it corresponds to ""green,"" while in others, it corresponds to ""red"" or ""yellow.""
- The meaning of ""bluf"" might be context-dependent rather than having a direct color association.

Hypothesizing a rule for ""bluf"":

Rule 1: ""bluf"" may correspond to the color following ""dax"" when in close proximity. This aligns with the first and fourth examples.
Rule 2: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it takes on the same color output as ""wif,"" which is red. This aligns with the second and fifth examples.
Rule 3: When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output color is ""yellow."" This aligns with the third example.

However, there is one instance that seems inconsistent (second example: ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red""), which could indicate a missing piece in the rule. Without further examples or clarification, a complete rule for ""bluf"" is difficult to confirm.

Inductive rule:
While not conclusively determined, a potential rule is that ""bluf"" may take the color of the word that immediately precedes it (if ""dax"" is green, then ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is green, if ""wif"" is red, then ""bluf"" after ""wif"" is red, and similarly for ""zup"" to yellow). More examples are needed to affirm this rule.

Based on the above, a tentative rule structure can be formulated:

Rule: bluf -> ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that precedes it, if there is no preceding color-associated word, its default or repeated color may be red.
Based on the provided examples, the output color for ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it a certain number of times. Looking at the inputs and their respective outputs, we can determine the following patterns:

- If the previous word is ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.
- If the previous word is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.
- If the preceding word is ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated four times.
- If ""walm"" is followed by another word such as ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" it is repeated twice for yellow.

While the exact rule for this replication pattern is not explicitly provided in the examples, we can deduce a general rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that precedes it a number of times. The specific number of times seems dependent on the relationship between ""walm"" and its preceding word, which is not completely clarified by the given examples.

Rule: walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word a number of times that seems dependent on the color or word association.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, it can be deduced that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided:

- ""dax lug bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green blue blue red""
- ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green""
- ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
- ""dax lug walm"" corresponds to ""green blue blue blue""
- ""zup wif dax walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red green green green""

From these examples, it is evident that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the inferred rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" is associated with the color red. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.

Here are the patterns in each provided case:

- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" suggesting that ""zup"" means ""yellow"" and ""wif"" means ""red.""
- ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red,"" suggesting again that ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" might indicate repetition or an additional ""red.""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" translates to ""green yellow red red blue,"" suggesting ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" might be ""red,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""
- ""wif dax zup dax"" translates to ""red green yellow green,"" here ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""wif dax"" translates to ""red green,"" which clearly shows ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" across all examples given.
Rule: bluf -> green after a color, yellow if it precedes or follows the color blue, otherwise red.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" seems to be closely related to the color word that precedes it, resulting in the repetition of that color's corresponding output. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears after a color-associated word, the output is a repetition of that color's corresponding output three times. For example, if ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" the output would be ""yellow yellow yellow."" If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" the output would be ""red red red,"" and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and see when ""dax"" appears and what output is associated with it. We will also look at the outputs associated with other words to see if they change or remain consistent.

1. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
2. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
3. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
4. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: dax zup lug wif zup -> Output: green yellow blue red yellow

Observations:
- Every time the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
- Other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" seem to produce different outputs, indicating that ""dax"" is the only word consistently linked to one color output.

Based on these observations, it appears that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> ""green""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Regardless of the context in which ""wif"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow"". This can be seen by looking at the position of ""zup"" in the inputs and the corresponding position of ""yellow"" in the outputs.

Therefore, the rule is:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" maps to a sequence of colors. The mapping is consistent with the position that ""bluf"" appears in the input sequence, regardless of the surrounding words.

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by two colors (red and green) and the output for ""bluf"" is two colors as well, yellow and red.

In the second example, ""bluf"" is paired with the word ""dax"" and the corresponding output is two greens, which are the same color as the output for ""dax"".

In the third example, ""bluf"" also maps to two colors (green and red), just like the second word following it in the sequence.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" appears at the end of the sequence and is followed by two colors in the output (red and red), suggesting that when ""bluf"" stands at the end, it might take the color from the preceding word but double it in the output.

Lastly, in the fifth example, where ""bluf"" is in the middle position and is followed by two occurrences of yellow, the output for ""bluf"" mirrors that with two yellows.

We can deduce that ""bluf"" transforms into two occurrences of the color represented by the word that comes immediately after ""bluf"" in the sequence, with a special rule when it stands at the end of an input sequence: it then repeats the color of the preceding word twice.

The exceptions seem to be when ""bluf"" is at the very end of the input, or there are no output colors to follow it. In those cases, with the examples given, it's unclear what rule ""bluf"" follows, as there's insufficient information to determine that part of the pattern.

Rule: bluf -> When followed by a word, outputs the color corresponding to that word twice. When at the end of the sequence, outputs the color corresponding to the preceding word twice (based on example 4). If ""bluf"" stands alone (not shown in examples), the behavior is unknown.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" it's important to analyze how the output changes in relationship to the presence of ""walm"" in the input. Let's look at the individual cases to understand the pattern:

1. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" 
   Output: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   
   Here, ""wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""red blue yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we see another ""yellow."" Note that ""wif lug"" at the end translates to ""red blue"" again. It's not clear what ""walm"" does based on this example alone, but it seems to lead to a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. Input: ""zup walm lug wif bluf""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red""
   
   ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""walm"" we have another ""yellow."" The sequence ""lug wif"" translates to ""blue red,"" with an extra ""red"" at the end after ""bluf."" The ""walm"" in this context again seems associated with the repetition of ""yellow.""

3. Input: ""zup lug walm wif dax""
   Output: ""yellow blue blue blue red green""
   
   ""Zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue."" ""Wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green."" So, ""walm"" leads to repeating the color that comes before it, which in this case is ""blue.""

4. Input: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm""
   Output: ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" after ""walm"" comes three ""red."" ""Lug"" is ""blue,"" and after ""zup walm"" we see ""yellow yellow yellow."" This reinforces the idea that ""walm"" causes the last mentioned color to repeat three times. 

5. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   
   Once more, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is ""yellow,"" and the output is three instances of ""yellow,"" consistent with earlier observations.

Rule:
Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the preceding color to be repeated three additional times.

walm -> meaning: Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the output ""green."" Each time the nonce word ""dax"" is presented in the input, the output includes ""green"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""dax"" based on the examples is the following:

Rule: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples given to see if there is a pattern or rule about how ""wif"" is translated into a color.

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: dax wif lug dax
   Output: green red blue green

3. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

4. Input: zup wif lug dax
   Output: yellow red blue green

5. Input: lug dax wif
   Output: blue green red

Looking at the input-output pairs, the translation of the word ""wif"" seems consistent—it always translates to ""red."" It does not appear to depend on the position of ""wif"" in the input or on the words around it.

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can infer the following pattern:
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position or surrounding words
- Other words, e.g., ""walm"" and ""bluf,"" have not been consistently translated or may introduce noise, thus we focus on the consistent translations.

Given these observations, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" in every given example, irrespective of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> substituting with the color that corresponds to the previous word based on a set pattern.

Rule: The word preceding ""bluf"" determines its color output:
- ""lug"" before ""bluf"" results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""red""
- It is not clear what ""bluf"" means with other preceding words due to insufficient examples, but given the structure, ""bluf"" likely depends on the preceding word to determine its output color.
Based on the examples given, we can infer that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of a color associated with a specific word preceding it three times. To identify the rules for ""walm,"" let's break down each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Inference: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes the output to repeat ""yellow"" three times.

2. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   Inference: Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times. Additionally, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and the pattern repeats as the words do.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Inference: ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and with ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

4. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Inference: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" so ""walm"" makes it repeat three times, followed by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" again, which corresponds to ""green.""

5. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   Inference: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color associated with ""dax"" (""green"") three times. Then ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

From these observations, we can derive the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule:
Walm -> Causes the color associated with the directly preceding word to be repeated three times in the output.

Using this rule:

- ""zup walm"" causes ""yellow"" (from ""zup"") to be repeated three times.
- ""lug walm"" causes ""blue"" (from ""lug"") to be repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" causes ""green"" (from ""dax"") to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can see that each time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: dax corresponds to the color green.
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let us analyze each of the provided examples and their corresponding outputs. We must identify a pattern that ties the input to the output.

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   Analysis: We can see that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" to ""red."" The ""wif"" is positioned between ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output color is ""red.""

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Analysis: With ""wif"" coming before ""zup"" in the input, we see that the color sequence is ""red yellow."" From previous analysis, ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Thus ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: With ""wif"" preceding ""bluf,"" and given that ""bluf"" is ""red,"" the appearance of ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   Analysis: As ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" we can see ""wif"" appears before a ""lug"" and translates to ""red.""

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" as established before. The output has one ""green"" and three ""yellow."" There is an additional ""yellow,"" which seems to be linked to a pattern concerning ""walm"" (since it does not have a preceding word-to-color pairing). ""Wif"" remains consistent as ""red.""

So, across all examples, regardless of its position in the sentence, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" There are no examples suggesting that the meaning of ""wif"" changes based on position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" adds one additional color to the output pattern, and that color is consistent with the one immediately preceding it. In every example, adding ""bluf"" to the input results in one extra instance of the last mentioned color in the output. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" seems to be blue, ""walm"" seems to be blue as well, ""wif"" seems to be red. The presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug"" adds an extra ""blue"" at the end.

2. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   Analysis: Here ""wif"" appears to be red, ""walm"" seems to still be red and ""lug"" as blue. ""Bluf"" adds an extra ""blue"" after the last blue which is associated with ""lug.""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" adds another ""yellow"" following the pattern. ""Lug"" then adds ""blue"" and ""walm"" adds another ""blue.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" adds an extra ""red"" to the output.

5. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Analysis: ""dax"" is green, ""bluf"" adds another ""green,"" and ""zup"" yields a yellow.

From these examples, the rule appears to be: when ""bluf"" is present in the input, repeat the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
From the provided examples, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. To confirm this, let's examine the instances where ""walm"" is used and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
2. ""zup walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. ""lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue
4. ""zup walm lug"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow red red red

Looking closely, we can see that:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the result is yellow repeated three times.
- In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" again, and the result is three repetitions of yellow.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, and the result is blue repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""walm"" again follows ""zup,"" resulting in three repetitions of yellow, followed by ""lug,"" which is blue.
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, and the result is red repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word in the input a number of times (three, in all provided examples).

Thus, the rule is:

walm -> The color of the word prior to ""walm"" is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the provided examples, we can try to find out what color is associated with the word ""lug"" based on its corresponding output each time it is used.

- In the first example, ""wif lug walm"" translates to ""red yellow red,"" so ""lug"" yields the color yellow.
- In the second example, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue,"" and ""bluf"" is directly associated with the color blue, so ""lug"" appearing before ""bluf"" doesn't change the output for ""bluf."" This indicates that ""lug"" could again be associated with the color blue.
- In the third example, ""zup lug dax"" translates to ""yellow blue green,"" which, if we have already associated ""zup"" with yellow and ""dax"" with green, implies that ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug dax wif lug"" translates to ""blue green red blue,"" where ""dax"" equals green and ""wif"" equals red. With ""lug"" appearing both before the green and after the red, consistently it still translates to blue.
- In the final example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow,"" and we see ""lug"" appears before ""zup,"" which we previously associated with yellow. And yet ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Based on these examples, the rule appears consistently that the word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each nonce word corresponds to a color. When the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is produced.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow"".
bluf -> meaning. Based on the patterns provided, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"" and to the output ""green"" when preceded by ""dax."" When ""bluf"" is not immediately preceded by either ""zup"" or ""dax"" but appears elsewhere in the sequence, like with ""wif"" in front, it repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word (""red"" in the given example). Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent on the preceding word. 

Rule: 
- If ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", output ""yellow"".
- If ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", output ""green"".
- If ""bluf"" follows any other word, repeat the color corresponding to that word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the given input-output pairs to see how the presence of ""walm"" and other words affect the output colors. 

Let's examine each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax
  - Output: yellow yellow yellow green
  - Insight: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces another yellow, so it seems to replicate the color of the word before it.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup
  - Output: red red red green yellow
  - Insight: Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and produces red, like the previous color.

3. Input: zup walm wif
  - Output: yellow yellow yellow red
  - Insight: Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces yellow; it continues the pattern of matching the color before it.

4. Input: dax lug walm
  - Output: green blue blue blue
  - Insight: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces blue, once again replicating the previous color.

5. Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
  - Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
  - Insight: Each ""walm"" produces the color of the word that precedes it (after the first ""lug"", ""walm"" produces blue; after ""zup"", ""walm"" produces yellow).

Based on the above analysis, we can construct the rule:

Rule: ""walm"" generates the same color as the word that immediately precedes it.

In formulating the rule:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:
walm -> ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue."" There is no variation in its translation across different contexts; regardless of its position or the words around it, ""lug"" is always mapped to ""blue."" Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given. Each other word in the input also seems to correspond to a specific color in the output, regardless of its position in the sentence, indicating a direct mapping from individual words to specific colors. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" to a sequence of four ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""bluf"" also to ""red"".
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's look at the patterns across the provided examples:

1.
Input: wif dax bluf
Output: red green green

2.
Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

3.
Input: dax zup wif
Output: green yellow red

4.
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

5.
Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue

Now let's analyze the pattern:
- Whenever ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is also in the output.
- The appearance of ""wif"" does not adhere to a fixed position corresponding to it being red. It can be the first word, which correlates to the first color in the output in example 1 and 5, or the last word correlating to the last color in the output in example 2, or somewhere in the middle as in example 3.
- Additionally, the other words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" etc., seem to translate consistently to their respective colors across different examples: ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Based on this information, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

The meaning of ""wif"" is the color ""red,"" independent of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently correlates with the color blue in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.
- The color ""blue"" does not appear in the output when ""bluf"" is not present in the input.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of the color that was mentioned just before it. The number of repetitions is directly proportional to the total number of words in the input, including both ""walm"" and the other words.

Let's break down each example:

1. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" leads to blue being repeated three times in total, coinciding with the total word count.

2. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times, totaling a word count of five.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" results in green being repeated three times before ""lug,"" which represents blue.

4. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes yellow to be repeated three times before ""wif,"" which represents red.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and with ""walm"" present and only two words in total, yellow is repeated to match the word count.

Rule:
walm -> Repetition of the color associated with the word preceding ""walm,"" with the number of repetitions equal to the total number of words present in the input sequence (counting ""walm"").

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine each instance of ""wif"" along with the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""zup wif bluf"" 
   Output: ""yellow red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

2. Input: ""wif""
   Output: ""red""
   - Without any other words, ""wif"" alone outputs ""red.""

3. Input: ""dax zup lug wif lug""
   Output: ""green yellow blue red blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - The ""wif"" here corresponds to ""red,"" just as ""lug"" appears again, still corresponding to ""blue.""

4. Input: ""lug zup dax wif zup""
   Output: ""blue yellow green red yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The ""wif"" here corresponds to ""red,"" and is followed by ""zup"" which corresponds to yellow.

5. Input: ""wif bluf lug zup""
   Output: ""red red blue yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - The ""wif"" at the beginning corresponds to ""red.""

Based on the patterns in the provided inputs and the corresponding outputs, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"", irrespective of the context in which it appears.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""zup"" by examining its context and corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when it is adjacent to ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" three times, with ""walm"" following it, which has no direct output but is preceded by ""red"" in the fifth example.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" and ""walm"" both corresponding to ""red.""

From these examples, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of the context. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color corresponding to the word that comes just before it."" 

For instance:

- wif bluf lug => red red blue (wif corresponds to red, so bluf means repeat the red before lug which is blue)
- zup bluf => yellow yellow (zup corresponds to yellow, so bluf repeats the yellow)
- zup bluf dax lug => yellow yellow green blue (zup is yellow so bluf repeats yellow, dax is green, and lug is blue)
- zup bluf wif => yellow yellow red (zup is yellow so bluf repeats yellow, wif is red)
- wif bluf dax => red red green (wif is red so bluf repeats red, dax is green)

Bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us look at the provided input and output examples and attempt to identify the patterns that could explain the word ""walm"":

1. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
4. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing the examples:

- For ""zup lug walm wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, ""zup"" gives one yellow, ""lug"" gives one blue, ""wif"" gives one red. The first instance of ""walm"" generates two additional blues, and the second instance of ""walm"" generates two additional reds.
- In the second example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" gives one yellow, and ""walm"" seems to be adding two more yellows to the sequence.
- For ""zup walm lug zup wif dax,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Again, ""zup"" gives yellow, ""lug"" gives blue, ""wif"" gives red, and ""dax"" gives green. The instance of ""walm"" preceding ""lug"" generated two additional yellows.
- In ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" gives blue, ""zup"" gives yellow, and ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" again gives a series of blues (three in this case).
- Lastly, ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue."" ""Walm"" after ""dax"" results in two additional greens, and ""lug"" at the end gives one blue.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color output of the preceding word two additional times. So if the word before ""walm"" is associated with ""yellow,"" ""walm"" will output two more ""yellow."" If the word before ""walm"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""walm"" will result in two more ""blue,"" and so on for ""red"" and ""green.""

Following these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it two additional times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the color of the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue across all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red,"" and the word ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green."" When used together, the sequence of ""wif"" and ""dax"" corresponds to the sequence ""red"" and ""green"" respectively. The word ""wif"" on its own results in ""red,"" and ""dax wif dax"" results in ""green red green.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is associated with the word that comes directly before it. Specifically, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated three times. 

The rule seems to be that when ""walm"" follows a word, the color associated with the word is outputted three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" 

When ""wif"" appears alone or with other words, the consistently corresponding output color is red. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" can be inferred as the color yellow.
To deduce the rule that defines what ""bluf"" means in the given context, let's compare each input with its corresponding output. We will look for patterns and consider ""bluf"" as a variable and try to understand its role within the sequences.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green
Rule observation: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""dax""; the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow,"" which is the same as ""zup.""

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
Rule observation: Here again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup."" This is consistent with the first example; ""bluf"" receives the same color ""yellow"" as ""zup.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red
Rule observation: In this example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and takes its corresponding color, which is ""green.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule observation: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" without anything after it but keeps the ""yellow"" color.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
Rule observation: ""bluf"" is after ""wif"" and acquires its color, which is ""red.""

Looking at these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that is immediately before it in the sequence. It behaves like a chameleon, taking on the attribute (color in this case) of its predecessor.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a unique color except for the nonce word ""walm,"" which seems to take on the color of the word that precedes it.

Here is how it breaks down:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

By looking at the sequence where 'walm' is used, its resulting color always matches the color of the preceding nonce word:

- ""lug walm zup"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow"", where ""walm"" takes on the blue of ""lug.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"", where both instances of ""walm"" take on the color of the words directly before them ('lug' then 'zup').
- ""wif walm zup"" results in ""red red red yellow"", where ""walm"" assumes the red from ""wif.""
- ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"", where ""walm"" takes on the green of ""dax.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green"" across all examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. There is no example contradicting this hypothesis as ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" seems to correspond to the color yellow in the output. Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the appearance of the word ""bluf"" results in the output of a color that matches the color associated with the word preceding it. To illustrate:

- In example 1 (""dax bluf""), ""dax"" results in ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats that color, leading to ""green green"".
  
- In example 2 (""dax zup bluf""), ""dax"" is ""green"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word just before it, giving ""yellow"".

- In example 3 (""dax bluf zup bluf dax""), the pattern continues where ""bluf"" matches the color of the preceding term: ""green"" follows ""dax"", ""yellow"" follows ""zup"", and so on.

- In example 4 (""zup bluf""), ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""yellow"".

- In example 5 (""wif lug bluf wif zup""), the pattern is consistent: ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" with ""blue"", and ""zup"" follows ""wif"" with ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and based on the repetition, ""walm"" seems to translate to ""yellow"".

2. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" in this context also resulted in ""blue"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" resulted in ""blue"" again, even with ""dax"" before it.

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" resulted in ""blue"" following ""lug"".

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""walm"" resulted in ""green"" when following ""dax"".

Based on the examples provided, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples, it's clear that whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the same position in the output. Here are the deductions from the examples:

Example 1:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" directly corresponds to blue.

Example 2:
Input: zup lug zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
In this case, the pairings are consistent with the first example, with ""zup"" corresponding to yellow and ""wif"" to red. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, in the same position as in the output.

Example 3:
Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue
Again, ""lug"" is translated to blue and ""zup"" to yellow.

Example 4:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Here, ""wif"" consistently translates to red, as in previous examples, and ""bluf"" seems to consistently translate to red, and ""dax"" to green. ""Walm"" doesn't appear to have a direct translation but might introduce an additional red. ""Lug"" once again translates to blue.

Example 5:
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug
Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Here, ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" here corresponds to yellow as well. ""Wif"" corresponds to red, and ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, just as in the other examples.

Thus, it can be concluded that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the input-output pairs to deduce the meaning of the word ""wif.""

1. In the first example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" maps to ""yellow red green red red."" We see that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" maps to ""red."" Every time the word ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" follows.

2. In the second example, ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow green yellow green red red."" Again, all individual words map to their respective colors, and after ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows, with ""bluf"" afterwards corresponding to ""red"" again.

3. In the third example, ""wif lug bluf"" turns into ""red blue blue."" The word ""lug"" appears for the first time and is mapped to ""blue,"" while ""wif"" as prior is followed by ""red"" and ""bluf"" maps to ""blue.""

4. The fourth example is ""wif walm,"" resulting in ""red red red."" This shows that ""walm"" is mapped to ""red,"" preceded by the color indicating ""wif,"" which is also ""red.""

5. ""wif zup lug wif"" corresponds to ""red yellow blue red."" Here, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and the instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red.""

It thus appears that ""wif"" directly corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. This is consistent across all examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following correlations between the input words and the output colors:

- ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of ""red"" (red red red)

Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

bluf -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the immediately preceding color's name a number of times in the output. Let's analyze each example:

Example 1:
Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- dax -> green
- walm follows dax and results in two additional ""green"" in the output.
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm follows lug and results in two additional ""blue"" in the output.

Example 2:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- walm follows dax and results in two additional ""green"" in the output.

Example 3:
Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- walm follows zup and results in two additional ""yellow"" in the output.
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Example 4:
Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue
- wif -> red
- walm follows wif and results in two additional ""red"" in the output.
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> blue

Example 5:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- wif -> red
- walm follows wif and results in two additional ""red"" in the output.

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times in the output sequence. 

walm -> Repeat the color given by the preceding word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

The examples given consistently show that when ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output. This is regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence of words or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples given, we observe the following:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect its corresponding output.

From this, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in the output. The examples do not seem to provide any additional context that alters the meaning of ""wif"" based on position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the word ""zup,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs in each example provided.

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug dax zup
   Output: blue green yellow

Let's analyze the appearances of ""zup"" and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup"" appears twice and is followed by the color yellow.
- In the second example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm dax lug"" and each of these is associated with yellow, green, and blue respectively.
- In the third example, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf lug"" which corresponds with yellow and blue.
- In the fourth example, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" which corresponds with yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""zup"" appears at the end and is associated with yellow.

From these observations, it is possible to deduce that ""zup"" correlates to the color yellow in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color green when it follows the word ""dax"" and to the color red when it follows the words ""lug"" or ""wif."" When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" it translates to the color yellow. In essence, the color output for ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it.

bluf -> green if preceded by ""dax""
bluf -> red if preceded by ""lug"" or ""wif""
bluf -> yellow if preceded by ""zup""
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" impacts the corresponding color output based on the context of its placement in the input. Let's analyze the examples to understand the rule governing ""walm"":

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Analysis: The third word, which is ""walm"", results in an output of ""blue"", which is the same color output as the word that immediately preceded it, ""lug"".

2. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green
   Analysis: Here, ""walm"" is in the second position and it results in the output ""green"", which is the same color output as the word before it, ""dax"".

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   Analysis: The third word, ""walm"", once again results in ""red"", which matches the color output of the word before it, ""wif"".

4. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   Analysis: As before, ""walm"" takes on the color output ""green"" of the word before it, ""dax"".

5. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Analysis: Each time ""walm"" appears, it replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it.

Based on these examples, ""walm"" functions as a duplicator of the color output of the word that comes directly before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word in the input sequence.

Rule: walm -> takes the output color of the word directly before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" is the color blue. 

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There's no variation in the output when ""dax"" is present, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. The rule seems straightforward without any context dependency.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" seems to depend on the word it follows. ""Bluf"" takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it. The associated colors are:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, if a word (e.g., ""lug"") precedes ""bluf,"" the output color (in this case, ""blue"") is repeated twice.

bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that “walm” causes the word that directly precedes it to repeat its associated color output three times. 

Here’s the breakdown:

1. In the first example, “dax walm” produces “green green green,” which suggests that “dax” corresponds to the color “green,” and “walm” causes it to repeat thrice.
2. In the second example, “zup walm” results in “yellow yellow yellow,” leading to the conclusion that “zup” corresponds to “yellow,” and “walm” repeats it three times.
3. The third example, “dax walm zup walm,” presents “green green green yellow yellow yellow,” which is consistent with the repetition rule for “walm.”
4. The fourth example includes “lug zup dax walm” and results in “blue yellow green green green,” which follows the established pattern with “lug” corresponding to “blue.”
5. The final example, “lug walm zup lug walm,” results in “blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue,” which again shows “walm” causing the color of the preceding word to repeat three times.

Rule:
walm -> causes the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" to be repeated three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" 

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it is clear that the word ""dax"" corresponds consistently to the color ""green"". Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. There are no examples to suggest that ""dax"" changes meaning based on its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can state the rule as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be consistent. In all instances where ""wif"" appears, it translates to the color red in the output. It does not seem to be context-dependent as it consistently translates to red regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow.' Each time 'zup' is present in the input, 'yellow' appears in the output. There doesn't appear to be a dependency on context or position within the sequence; 'zup' consistently corresponds to 'yellow' regardless of its place in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"", let's analyze the inputs and outputs keeping track of the position of the word ""bluf"" in different examples:

1. zup bluf dax -> yellow yellow green
2. dax bluf zup bluf dax -> green green yellow yellow green
3. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
4. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow

In examples 1, 3, and 5, the word ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", which is then followed by ""yellow yellow"" in the output. In example 2, both instances of ""bluf"" are followed by ""yellow"" as well. However, in example 4, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red"" in the output, because after ""bluf,"" a word appears that wasn't in any of the other inputs (""wif"").

The pattern here suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. In examples where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" the color ""yellow"" follows, and when ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" ""green"" follows. We don't see ""bluf"" following ""wif"" somewhere else, but the ""red"" color likely associates with the word ""wif"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Rule: 

To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the common output pattern each time ""walm"" appears:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif | Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
2. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
3. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
4. Input: wif dax zup walm | Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing the inputs and the corresponding outputs, ""walm"" consistently results in three instances of the color directly following it in the sequence, except when followed by ""lug,"" which results in a new color, blue. Here’s how the outputs correlate with the words preceding ""walm"" in the outputs:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the output is three yellows.
- In the second example, ""walm"" is again followed by ""wif,"" resulting in three reds.
- In the third example, ""walm"" is first followed by ""wif,"" and the second time by ""zup,"" leading to three reds, then three yellows.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in three yellows.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" leading to three green colors and then a new color, blue.

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":
""walm"" -> When ""walm"" is followed by another word, it results in three instances of the color that represents the word immediately after ""walm,"" except when followed by a new or irregular word (""lug"" in this case), resulting in a new color sequence that includes blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Here are the observations that lead to this conclusion:

- Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.
- The position of ""lug"" in the input matches the position of ""blue"" in the output.
- Regardless of the other words in the input, the presence of ""lug"" always results in a ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color word that matches the color word immediately preceding it. For instance, if ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" following ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as well.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we'll look for patterns in the input and output pairs provided. The word ""walm"" always seems to correspond to a specific pattern in the output:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
Here, ""walm"" results in three occurrences of ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in three occurrences of ""red,"" which is the representation for ""wif,"" followed by ""blue,"" the representation for ""lug.""

Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" again and results in three occurrences of ""red,"" followed by ""green,"" the representation for ""dax.""

Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in three occurrences of ""red,"" without a representation following for ""bluf.""

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Here, ""walm"" once again results in three occurrences of ""yellow,"" the representation for ""zup,"" followed by ""blue,"" the representation for ""lug.""

From these observations, we can see that ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the output of the previous word three times. If there's a word following ""walm,"" its output is also included once after the repetition. So we can establish the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the previous word to be repeated three times in the output. If there is a word after walm, its corresponding color appears once after the repetition.

Thus, the inductive rule for ""walm"" can be stated as:
walm -> Repeat the previous word's corresponding color output three times, followed by the color output of the subsequent word if there is one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug bluf wif
    ",Output: green blue blue red,green blue blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the given examples, every time the nonce word 'lug' is presented as input, the corresponding output is 'blue'. Therefore, the rule is that the word 'lug' translates to the color 'blue'.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look for patterns in the input and output:

Input: dax zup walm wif
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" seems also to correspond to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- This string reinforces the idea that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow""
- The order of ""dax"" and ""zup"" changes, but their corresponding colors remain the same

Input: zup wif zup dax
Output: yellow red yellow green
- Once again, ""dax"" is ""green,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red""

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- Here we find a new word, ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue""
- The color associations for ""dax"" and ""zup"" are consistent with previous examples

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- This string suggests ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" which is a deviation from the first input where it was associated with yellow

Given the context provided, we can see that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. However, the color associated with ""walm"" changed in the last example, which suggests that the meaning of ""dax"" may influence the color output of subsequent words.

The consistent rule we can deduce from these examples is:

Rule: dax -> green

However, it's important to note that to make a definitive rule about the word ""dax"" in relation to ""walm"" or any other word, more examples would be needed. As it stands, there is a direct correlation between ""dax"" and ""green,"" but the rules regarding other words and their color outputs might be influenced by the presence of ""dax"" or other words in the sequence, which is not entirely clear from the examples provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red."" When ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output always includes ""red."" Specifically, ""bluf"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that it might represent a duplicated word concept, where the meaning is ""red"" repeated. 

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red red
walm -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with that preceding word is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears.

For example:
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of that color.
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue,"" and ""walm"" indicates the repetition of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every example given.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the consistent pattern of its appearance and the corresponding output:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
5. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green

Based on the examples, it appears that the output color related to the word ""dax"" is ""green"". Every time the word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output includes the word ""green"". This pattern holds true regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sentence. 

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the inputs and their associated outputs. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   In the output, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red
   Here, ""wif"" again corresponds to the color ""red.""

3. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Again, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   Once more, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

5. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red
   And again, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

By examining the consistent association between ""wif"" and the color ""red"" in the outputs, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. The meaning of ""wif"" is ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, its corresponding output color is ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently across all examples. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""zup"" is always translated as ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule we can deduce is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word is associated with a specific color. We can observe the following associations:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green

The word ""bluf"" appears to be consistently followed by the color ""red"" in the output. Now let's examine the inputs and outputs in detail to deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

2. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

In the outputs, the color red appears immediately after each occurrence of ""bluf."" Additionally, ""bluf"" does not correspond to one of the pre-established colors (red, green, yellow). This suggests that ""bluf"" is not a direct representation of a color by itself, but might affect the following word(s). Given that ""dax"" and ""walm"" are associated with the color green and ""wif"" with red, the appearance of the color red instead of green after ""bluf"" shows that ""bluf"" changes the color of the following word to red, regardless of what it would normally correspond to.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

Rule: bluf -> changes the color representation of the following word to red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times. Looking at the examples:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it causes ""green"" to be outputted thrice.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" following it causes ""yellow"" to be outputted thrice.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following it causes ""blue"" to be outputted thrice, followed by the color ""green"" that corresponds to ""dax.""

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" following it causes ""green"" to be outputted thrice. Then ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and finally another ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" following it causes ""blue"" to be outputted thrice.

Rule:
walm -> causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug zup lug
    ",Output: blue green blue yellow blue,blue green blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Regardless of the context or position in the sequence, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the information given, it seems that ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Here's the breakdown of the correspondence between each input and its respective output color:

1. ""bluf"" -> green
2. ""wif"" -> red
3. ""walm"" -> red
4. ""lug"" -> blue
5. ""zup"" -> yellow

In every instance, no matter the surrounding words, ""dax"" correlates to ""green."" Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" we can look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

1. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" or ""dax"", the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". This rule can be observed in the first, fourth, and fifth examples.
2. When ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"", the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow"". This rule can be confirmed from the third example.

It seems that the position of ""zup"" (whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence) does not change the output associated with it. Also, regardless of the word that follows ""zup"", the output color for ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow"".

From these observations, the rule can be simplified to:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Therefore, the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the correlation between the input and output sequences. It appears that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output.

Let's examine each case:

1. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

2. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

3. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

4. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" corresponds to ""red""

5. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

In each case, the appearance of ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that was just previous to it repeating one or more times. There is one instance that challenges this pattern (the second example), where ""bluf"" generates two ""red"" colors instead of just one more ""blue"" to continue the pattern from ""walm."" However, since ""walm"" is not directly before ""bluf,"" it seems that ""bluf"" extends the sequence of the color directly preceding it.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that directly precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the previous color.
Given the input and output examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" might not correspond to a fixed color but a rule or pattern.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   Observing the pattern, after ""walm"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times, until ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

   After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated twice.

3. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

   After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated twice, similar to example 2.

4. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

   After ""walm"", the color ""green"" is repeated two times, followed by ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

   After ""walm"", the color ""blue"" is repeated two times, similar to example 2 and 3.

All examples display that after the word ""walm"" is mentioned, the color mentioned immediately before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times (at least twice) before switching to a different color.

Rule: ""walm"" indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" should be repeated multiple times (at least twice) before changing to a different color.

Walm -> The word preceding ""walm"" is repeated in its corresponding color at least two more times before the sequence resumes with a new color or word pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the inputs and outputs presented, it's possible to deduce a meaning for the word ""lug"" by looking for consistent patterns.

In each output, where the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" corresponds.

Observations:
1. ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
2. It seems that ""lug"" does not depend on any adjacent words, because its output is always ""blue"" even when the surrounding words change (""wif"", ""walm"", ""dax"", etc.). 

Drawing from these observations, we can define the meaning of ""lug"" in this context.

Rule: lug -> meaning: ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as shown consistently across all examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. In each instance where ""wif"" appears, the output contains the color red. If ""wif"" is the only input, then only ""red"" is the output. If there are other nonce words before or after ""wif,"" they produce their corresponding colors alongside the color red that ""wif"" produces.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This is consistent across all examples where ""bluf"" always results in the output color ""yellow"".
walm -> three times the color before it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is encountered, it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it three times. For instance, ""wif walm"" outputs ""red red red"" because ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""walm"" triples it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
Analyzing the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" is consistently associated with the color ""red."" However, the only exception is when ""wif"" is directly followed by the word ""dax,"" resulting in the color ""green."" It's worth noting that no other pairings are demonstrated, so there could be other rules for other word combinations, but with the given examples, we can only induce the following rules:

1. ""wif"" on its own translates to ""red.""
2. ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" is presented alone or is not followed by the specific word ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color ""red."" When ""wif"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" appears to be linked to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the result includes the word ""yellow."" It does not seem to depend on context since it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Following the pattern from the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here's how the correspondence works:

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""red"" (seems incorrect based on other examples, probably a mistake, ""zup"" should correspond to ""yellow"")

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" (seems incorrect based on other examples, probably a mistake, ""bluf"" should correspond to ""yellow"")
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Considering the rest of the examples and ignoring the possible mistakes in the patterns:

Rule: bluf corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore:

bluf -> yellow.
To discern the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" from the provided examples, let's look for patterns. We know each ""walm"" is followed by a color sequence. By comparing the sequences that follow ""walm"", we may be able to identify ""walm's"" rule or meaning.

- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Input: dax walm zup -> Output: green green green yellow
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red

Looking at the first color after each ""walm"":
- After ""dax walm"", the output color is red.
- After ""wif walm"", the output color is also red.
- However, after ""lug walm"", the output color is blue.

We notice that whatever follows ""walm"" does not affect the first color in the sequence. Instead, the word that precedes ""walm"" immediately is deciding what the first color after ""walm"" will be.

To understand the pattern, we look at the word before ""walm"" and the color sequence that follows it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the color sequence starts with green.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the color sequence starts with red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the color sequence starts with blue.

Additionally, these colors (green, red, blue) are repeated three times, which indicates that ""walm"" might involve repeating the color associated with the previous word three times.

Given that, we can induce the following rule:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

So for each input:
- ""dax walm"" implies a ""green"" sequence thrice because ""dax"" is associated with green.
- ""wif walm"" implies a ""red"" sequence thrice because ""wif"" is associated with red.
- ""lug walm"" implies a ""blue"" sequence thrice because ""lug"" is associated with blue.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: yellow green blue green,yellow green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, each word appears to correspond to a color. The word ""dax"" is consistently translated to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Thus, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
From the examples provided, ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red"" in the output. The words ""walm,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" result in the colors ""green,"" ""green,"" and ""blue,"" respectively. The word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" It does not appear that ""wif"" necessitates context from surrounding words to determine its output as ""red."" Rather ""wif"" seems to be a direct mapping to ""red.""

Thus, the rule we can deduce from the examples provided is:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning, whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be that it takes on the color of the word that immediately follows it. When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow blue."" When followed by ""walm,"" the output is ""yellow yellow."" When ""zup"" is at the end of a sequence or not followed by another word, it defaults to ""yellow."" 

Here are the mappings from the examples:

1. ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow blue""
2. ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow""
3. ""zup dax"" -> ""yellow green""
4. ""zup lug"" -> ""yellow blue""

Rule: ""zup"" takes the color of the word following it; if there is no following word, or it is the last word in the sequence, its color is yellow.

Hence, the rule can be summarized as:

zup -> when followed by a word, takes the color of the next word; if standalone or at the end, the color is yellow.
Given:

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
Output: blue red blue green green

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" here's the analysis:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif dax"" the output is ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" the output is also ""yellow"", which is the same as the output for ""zup"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug dax"" the output is ""green"", which is the output for ""dax"".
- When ""bluf"" precedes ""lug"" the output is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" by itself converts to ""blue"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" the output is ""red"", which is the same as the output for ""wif"".

From this, we can induce that ""bluf"" results in repeating the color of the word that comes immediately before it. 

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color of the preceding word.

Hence:

- In ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf dax"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- In ""lug wif lug dax bluf"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""dax"", which is ""green"".
- In ""zup bluf lug zup walm"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"", which is ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf zup"", ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""wif"", which is ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""walm"" influences the number of colored words in the output depending on context, specifically the position of ""walm"" and the other words occurring before it. It seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word directly preceding it. Additionally, the number of repetitions of the color word may increase by one each time ""walm"" appears in the sequence.

Here are the rules deduced from the examples:

- ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" maps to the color ""green.""
- ""lug"" maps to the color ""blue.""
- ""wif"" maps to the color ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is not explicitly paired with a color, but based on other examples, it may be reasonable to assume ""bluf"" also maps to ""red,"" since it appears output colors have consistent word associations.

Let's examine each case:

1. ""zup walm dax lug"": Yellow is repeated thrice because of ""walm,"" which is followed by ""green"" and ""blue.""
2. ""zup bluf wif walm"": One instance of yellow and one instance of red which could indicate ""bluf"" means ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which causes ""red"" to repeat twice more.
3. ""wif dax zup walm"": ""Red,"" ""green,"" ""yellow"" are listed once each, followed by ""yellow"" repeated twice due to ""walm.""
4. ""zup lug walm wif walm"": One instance of yellow, followed by two instances of blue due to ""walm,"" then one instance of red, with ""walm"" repeating ""red"" twice more.
5. ""dax lug walm"": One instance of green, followed by three instances of blue due to ""walm.""

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated in the output, with the repetition count being equal to the number of times ""walm"" has appeared consecutively plus one. If ""walm"" appears after a color word that is not repeated by another occurrence of ""walm,"" the preceding color word is repeated once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
Based on the provided examples, each time the nonce word ""wif"" appears, it is translated to ""red"" in the output sequence. 

There is no additional context indicating that the meaning of ""wif"" is dependent on its position in the sequence or on the words around it. In all occurrences, irrespective of whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input, or whether it is surrounded by other words or not, it consistently outputs ""red"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word corresponds to a color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it in the input sequence. If no word precedes it, bluf represents the color green.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given:

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Based on this example, ""walm lug wif"" translates to ""red blue red"", which indicates that ""walm"" cannot mean either red or blue. It must be interpreted within a larger context.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Here, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"". Since ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" it is possible that ""walm"" means to repeat the color given before it, i.e., blue in this case.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this case, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue"". Given ""dax"" means ""green"" and ""lug"" means ""blue,"" ""walm"" following these colors also results in blue being repeated.

Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

Here, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"" suggesting ""walm"" repeats the green. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" thereby suggesting ""walm"" repeats the red as well.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

In this example, ""lug walm"" at the end translates to ""blue blue blue"", reiterating the ""blue"" corresponding to ""lug"". It appears to reinforce the pattern that ""walm"" repeats the preceding color.

Rule:
Based on the examples and their corresponding outputs, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word that precedes it. 

Meaning:
walm -> repeat the preceding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following color correspondences:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Looking at these correspondences in relation to the word 'lug':

- When 'lug' appears in the sequence, the corresponding output color is 'blue.'

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" each time it is used. The other words seem to have their own color associations as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""walm"" is repeated three times in its output as ""green,"" suggesting each instance of ""walm"" translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" causes repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the analysis:

1. Input: ""wif lug walm""
   Output: ""red blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to be repeated three times.

2. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.

3. Input: ""dax walm zup lug""
   Output: ""green green green yellow blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

4. Input: ""dax walm lug""
   Output: ""green green green blue""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

5. Input: ""zup dax walm""
   Output: ""yellow green green green""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

walm -> meaning: Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times. Rule: When ""walm"" is encountered after a word, the output color for that word is repeated an additional three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
From the given examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is present in the output. Moreover, the position of ""dax"" in the input affects the position of ""green"" in the output, though the exact positioning rule isn't entirely clear based on these examples alone. 

Further analysis of the other words in the input and their corresponding colors in the output suggest that ""wif"" might correspond to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" might indicate a repetition of the preceding color in the output.

Let's verify this with the given examples:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green

   ""wif"" -> red, ""dax"" -> green

2. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

   ""dax"" -> green, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""wif"" -> red

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red

   ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red

4. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue

   ""zup"" -> yellow, ""bluf"" -> unknown but appears to correlate with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green, ""lug"" again -> blue

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""dax"" -> green, ""wif"" -> red, ""walm"" -> red (repeating previous color), ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow, ""walm"" -> yellow (repeating previous color)

From this analysis, we have:

Rule: ""dax"" -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the pattern of colors and how they correspond to the words in the input. Looking at the repeated usage of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding color output in each example, we can establish a rule:

- In the first example, the word ""wif"" is preceded by two occurrences of ""walm,"" and the output showcases three yellow colors followed by one red, which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
  
- In the second and third examples, ""wif"" is used with ""lug,"" and both outputs are ""red blue,"" supporting the notion that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif"" appears at the end of a series of different words, and the colors preceding the double ""red"" are yellow and green from other words, making it clear that these are not influenced by ""wif.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax wif"" corresponds to ""green red,"" where ""dax"" could be linked to ""green,"" leaving ""wif"" associated with ""red.""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the rule as follows:

Rule: wif corresponds to the color ""red."" 

Therefore: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: zup corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" represents a repeated color from the previous word in the sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to translate to a repetition of the color denoted by the word immediately preceding it. Here is the deduced rule applied to each example:

- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"", ""lug"" stands for blue, and it is followed by ""walm"", which is then translated as ""blue blue blue"".
- In ""dax walm lug"", ""dax"" stands for green, so ""walm"" translates to ""green green"", and then ""lug"" is blue.
- In ""dax walm wif bluf"", ""dax"" stands for green again, so ""walm"" is ""green green"", followed by ""wif"" as red and ""bluf"" repeating the red.
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"", ""wif"" stands for red, so ""walm"" is ""red red"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" stands for blue, and ""walm"" repeats the blue as ""blue blue"".

Rule: walm -> meaning. Meaning is a repetition of the color word immediately before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green,green green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color ""blue."" In all instances where ""lug"" appears, the output is consistently ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
From the given examples, it appears that each word corresponds to a specific color. By comparing the inputs with their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of ""dax.""

- In the first and second examples, ""dax"" results in ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" still results in ""green"" despite being in a different position.
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" regardless of its position and the number of words around it.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" maintains the output ""green.""

Given the consistency across examples, it seems ""dax"" simply translates to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the series of words.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each example shows that when ""wif"" is present as an input, the output always includes ""red."" Other words in the examples (lug, bluf, zup, dax) correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" consistently maps to the color red, irrespective of the order or position in the list.

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can notice that the presence of the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output of the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the presence or position of other words. Let's break it down:

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
- ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" at the beginning still gives us ""yellow""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""zup"" at the start produces ""yellow""

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- Alone, ""zup"" also yields ""yellow""

It appears that other words, such as ""dax"" or ""walm,"" may correspond to colors themselves and can lead to repetitions of their respective color in the output. However, for the nonce word ""zup,"" the rule seems clear.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Here’s how the rule applies to each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Explanation: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" therefore ""bluf"" also means ""yellow.""

2. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" therefore ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Explanation: Same as the first example.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" therefore ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red
   Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" therefore ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.
Analyzing the given examples, we notice a pattern involving the word ""walm"" and the colors that follow it. Here is the breakdown:

1. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue,"" while ""lug"" alone in other contexts results in a single ""blue.""
   - This suggests that ""walm"" might expand the number of times ""blue"" appears.

2. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red.""
   - Here again, ""yellow"" is repeated three times rather than once after ""walm.""

3. ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" translates to ""red red green green red red red blue red.""
   - ""walm"" seems to add extra ""red"" before ""lug"" transitions it to ""blue.""

4. ""lug walm"" is followed by ""blue blue blue,"" consistent with previous patterns.

5. ""lug walm wif bluf"" becomes ""blue blue blue red red,"" where ""walm"" triplicates ""blue"" before transitioning to ""red"" after ""wif.""

From these examples, it is possible to deduce that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately following it to be repeated three times. However, without a strict control (where ""walm"" is not immediately followed by another color word), we cannot be certain if there are additional rules at play. Based on the given examples, we can define the rule as:

Rule: walm -> causes the color produced by the next word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue""

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided input and output pair.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words. In all given examples, the occurrence of ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" consistently in each example. Here are the patterns that can be observed:

Example 1:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
Output: red red blue green red

Example 3:
Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Example 4:
Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Example 5:
Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

From the above, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence, the output is always ""green"" for ""bluf"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> green.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and outputs of each example to identify the consistent pattern.

Example 1:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

The sequence ""lug wif zup wif"" corresponds to ""blue red yellow red,"" and after the addition of ""walm,"" the output is ""red red."" This indicates that ""walm"" has caused the last distinct color (red) to repeat twice.

Example 2:
Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue

In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two additional ""green"" before ""lug"" changes the output to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it appears that ""dax walm"" leads to a repetition of ""green,"" which is the color corresponding to ""dax,"" before moving on to the next color.

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" giving ""green blue,"" and after ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" caused the last color to repeat thrice.

Example 4:
Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

The word ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue,"" followed by ""walm,"" which leads to two additional ""blue,"" and finally ""wif"" changes the color to ""red."" ""Walm"" here again seems to be causing a repetition of the last given color, which is ""blue"" in this case.

Example 5:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

""Zup"" relates to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" relates to ""red,"" but following ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated twice more. This further supports the rule that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last color mentioned before it.

Considering the pattern in these examples, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is that it causes the immediately preceding color to be repeated three more times.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediately preceding color word's output to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup walm
    ",Output: red yellow yellow yellow,red yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position or the words that come before or after it in the input. Therefore, it appears that the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that each word corresponds to a color. Here is the information we can extract:

- Whenever the input contains ""zup,"" the output always starts with ""yellow.""
- The presence of ""wif"" results in ""red"" in the output.
- The occurrence of ""bluf"" results in ""yellow"" in outputs except for in the third example, where it results in ""red"" for an unknown reason. This inconsistency may be a mistake, as it contradicts the other examples.
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
- ""walm"" leads to repeated ""yellow"" in the output, and in the one instance it is used, it results in three ""yellow"" colors that follow it.

Without more examples, it is difficult to discern the complete set of rules for all words, but for ""zup,"" the rule appears consistent. 

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that directly precedes it, which is given as the next word's corresponding color in the Output. Analyzing the sequences to understand the pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green.

Therefore, ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color associated with the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Observing the examples and the color sequences they produce, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm.""

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue

Here, ""walm"" seems to be followed by two instances of ""blue.""

Input: zup walm lug wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

In this example, after ""zup walm,"" we get ""yellow blue,"" which is consistent with the previous example if we consider that ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this sequence, following ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue,"" which is consistent with the pattern we are observing. ""Walm"" always seems to produce two ""blue"" colors.

Input: wif dax zup walm
Output: red green yellow yellow yellow

After ""walm,"" the output ends with ""yellow yellow,"" which is different from the ""blue blue"" pattern we noticed. However, if we take into account that ""zup"" preceded ""walm"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" it could be that ""walm"" here affects the preceding color.

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

In the last example, ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" and then ""yellow,"" which is affected by ""zup."" The ""walm"" associated with ""blue"" is consistent, but it's difficult to discern a clear rule in relation to the other colors.

Considering these examples, the most consistent observation is that ""walm"" often results in at least one instance of ""blue"" in the output. However, the second color that follows varies, potentially influenced by the surrounding words.

Given the examples, the clearest rule we can deduce is that the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" at least once in the output sequence. However, the input word preceding ""walm"" seems to influence the subsequent color(s) in the output, which adds an additional layer of complexity to the rule.

Rule: walm -> The presence of ""walm"" in the input results in ""blue"" appearing at least once in the output sequence at the corresponding position; the pattern of colors immediately after ""walm"" may be influenced by the word that precedes ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems quite straightforward:

Input: lug
Output: blue

We have a direct association between the word ""lug"" and the color ""blue.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue

This example contains other nonce words, but consistently, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" as seen in the final position.

Input: lug wif
Output: blue red

""lug"" appears first and translates to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" appears second, translating to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
Output: red red yellow red blue green

The word ""lug"" again matches with ""blue,"" maintaining consistency across all examples.

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue

In this input, ""lug"" appears twice and corresponds to ""blue"" both times. The word ""dax"" appears in the middle, translating to ""green.""

Rule:
lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every provided example.
Rule: wif -> red.
Examining the given examples, we can look for patterns:

1. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green
3. Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
5. Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue

We can see that the outputs consist of color names. In every instance where the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is outputted. Upon closer inspection, we also observe that the other words correspond consistently to specific colors:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- bluf -> green
- walm does not have a corresponding color mentioned, but given the pattern, we can infer that it might also translate to ""yellow"" or that repetition of ""yellow"" implies a sequence of the same color (here, three ""yellow"" in a row).

Thus, the rules for translation seem to be associating specific colors to specific words. Using this algorithm, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow."" Hence,

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine each example to find patterns:

1. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

3. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

5. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

In examples (1) and (3) where ""lug"" is present, the word ""blue"" is also present in the output. The sequence ""bluf lug"" gives ""blue blue"" in (1), and ""bluf"" gives ""yellow"" after ""zup"" in (3), but that is inconsistent with examples (4) and (5) where ""bluf"" appears without ""lug"" and gives repeated colors (red and green respectively).

In example (2), ""dax bluf"" gives ""green green,"" which suggests that ""bluf"" repeats the color generated by the word just before it.

In example (4), ""dax walm wif bluf"" outputs ""green green green red red,"" and in example (5), ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red green red red,"" both of which reinforce the idea that ""bluf"" causes repetition of the color resulting from the word immediately before it.

Consistently across the examples where ""bluf"" appears, the color outputted before ""bluf"" is repeated after it. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf causes the repeat of the color that was outputted from the word that comes directly before it.

Therefore:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: bluf repeats the color of the preceding word in the sequence.
To determine the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns before and after ""walm"" is used in each input, as well as the corresponding outputs.

Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug 
Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""wif lug."" The output after ""walm"" is two instances of ""yellow"" followed by a sequence that starts with ""red blue,"" which follows the pattern of ""wif lug.""

Input: lug walm wif lug 
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""wif lug."" The output after ""walm"" is a sequence of ""blue red blue,"" which again follows the pattern of ""wif lug"" after an additional instance of ""blue.""

Input: dax walm zup 
Output: green green green yellow

Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""dax"" and followed by ""zup."" The output after ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" and the pattern of ""green green green"" before it corresponds to a repetition of ""dax.""

Input: wif walm dax zup 
Output: red red red green yellow

In this input, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""dax zup."" The output after ""walm"" is ""green yellow,"" which follows the pattern of ""dax zup.""

Input: dax zup walm wif walm 
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Here, ""walm"" is first preceded by ""dax zup"" and first followed by ""wif,"" with the output following the sequence of ""yellow red."" When ""walm"" is followed by another ""walm,"" we have a sequence of ""yellow red red red,"" which suggests a repetition of the pattern of ""wif.""

Considering the patterns seen in each case, we can deduce that ""walm"" functions as a word that repeats the color pattern from the preceding word or phrase. If the word or phrase before ""walm"" is a single word, ""walm"" causes that word's color to repeat three times. If the phrase before ""walm"" contains two words, the color pattern of that phrase repeats twice.

Rule: walm -> meaning. 
Meaning: ""Repeat the color pattern of the preceding word or phrase.""
If preceded by a single word, repeat that word's color three times. 
If preceded by a two-word phrase, repeat the color pattern of that phrase twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup
    ",Output: green yellow,green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position or frequency in the input sentence.
From the examples provided, we observe the following:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"":
    Input: dax
    Output: green

- Whenever ""dax"" appears in a sequence (regardless of its position), it always translates to ""green"":
    Input: zup lug walm wif dax
    Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

    Input: dax bluf lug wif
    Output: green green blue red

    Input: lug wif dax
    Output: blue red green

    Input: lug dax wif
    Output: blue green red

Consequently, through these observations, we can deduce that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Using the given examples, let's see if we can determine the rule by comparing the input and output where the word ""wif"" is involved:

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

2. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue

3. Input: dax lug wif
   Output: green blue red

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red

Looking at these examples, ""wif"" appears to correspond to the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position, regardless of the context or position of the word ""wif"" in the sequence. This consistency across examples suggests that the rule for ""wif"" is simply a direct translation to the color ""red"". So we can state the rule as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it is possible to infer that the output is a sequence of colors, with each input word corresponding to a specific color. Here is the breakdown of inputs to their respective color outputs:

- ""wif"" always maps to ""red""
- ""lug"" always maps to ""blue""
- ""dax"" always maps to ""green""
- ""zup"" always maps to ""yellow""

When looking at the examples involving the nonce word ""bluf,"" the results are as follows:
- When ""bluf"" is present with ""wif,"" it results in ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" may amplify or duplicate the color output of the word it accompanies.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow,"" again indicating a duplication effect.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""dax,"" we only get a single ""blue"" for ""bluf"" and not a duplication, suggesting ""bluf"" is also translated to ""blue"" itself.

Taking all observations into account, ""bluf"" could mean ""duplicate the previous color, unless it is 'lug' or 'dax,' in which case it is blue."" Since ""bluf"" doesn't follow itself, we don't have an example of what it should do in that case, but based on existing examples, it might possibly result in ""blue blue.""

However, the rule is not completely consistent given the example ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" where the output is ""yellow blue red green green red"". In this case, ""bluf"" leads to ""green"" which does not follow the previously inferred pattern; this might be an exception or indicate that ""bluf"" can also take the color of ""dax,"" which proceeds it, in absence of a pattern.

Considering this inconsistency, the rule governing 'bluf' can't be definitively determined based on the given information, and it could be context-sensitive, but a reasonable attempt might be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicate the previous color output, but if the preceding word is ""lug"" or ""dax"" (or potentially any word that maps to ""blue"" or ""green""), then output the color associated with that word instead. If followed by ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" seems to be skipped or combined into the duplication of ""red."" 

This rule is subject to change as more data might provide a clearer pattern.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to correspond with a repetition of the color that directly follows ""walm."" Here's how the rule applies in the provided examples:

1. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Application: The color after ""walm"" is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" results in two additional ""yellow"" being added to the output.

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule Application: The color after ""walm"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" results in two additional ""blue"" being added to the output.

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule Application: This is a duplication of example 2 and follows the same pattern.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   Rule Application: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), resulting in two additional ""green."" The second ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red), so two more ""red"" are added before ending with ""zup"" (yellow).

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Rule Application: After the first ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" causes two more ""green"" to be added. The following colors are ""red"" and ""blue,"" after which there's another ""dax"" (green) followed by ""walm,"" resulting in two additional ""green.""

By generalizing this pattern, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears in the input sequence, it causes the next color word in the sequence to repeat twice additionally in the output sequence. If the color word is ""red,"" you get ""red red red,"" for ""blue,"" you get ""blue blue blue,"" and for ""green,"" you get ""green green green,"" and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word dax corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the context. This conclusion is drawn from the following observations:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears alone or as the first word in the input, the output starts with ""yellow"".
- The presence of ""zup"" at various places within the input string always corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- No other word in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, which suggests that ""zup"" uniquely represents ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the color patterns in the provided examples in relation to the word's position.

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Input: dax bluf zup
Output: green green yellow

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

From the examples, we can observe the following patterns related to ""bluf"":

1. When ""bluf"" is directly followed by another word, the color following it in the output matches the one indicated by that word's rule (e.g. ""bluf zup"" leads to ""green yellow"").
2. When ""bluf"" is the last word or is only followed by ""dax,"" the color indicated is always ""red.""
3. When ""bluf"" follows the word ""dax,"" it is represented by ""green.""

With the patterns above, we might deduce that ""bluf"" mimics the color indicated by the next word, unless it is the last word or followed by ""dax,"" in which cases it is red. However, we have insufficient context to formulate a precise general rule because we don't have a direct correspondence to other output colors excluding the combination with ""dax"" and when it's at the end of the sequence or followed by ""dax.""

Based on this information, we can propose a tentative rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: ""bluf"" -> adopts the color of the following word, except when it is the last word or followed by ""dax,"" in which cases the output color is red.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm"" in the given context, let's analyze the examples provided and look for patterns.

In each input-output pair:

1. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

4. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Looking at each instance of ""walm"" in the inputs and the corresponding outputs:

- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" (examples 1, 2, and 4), the color red is repeated three times.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" (examples 3 and 5), the color green is repeated multiple times (four times in example 3 and three times in example 5).
- ""Walm"" does not seem to correlate with a static color as the color changes depending on the preceding word.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be as follows:

The word ""walm"" causes the preceding word's output color to repeat thrice if that word is ""wif,"" and ""walm"" causes the preceding word's output color to repeat for as many times as ""dax"" appears before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" -> When following ""wif,"" it means ""repeat the color 'red' three times."" When following ""dax,"" it means ""repeat the color 'green' as many times as 'dax' appears before 'walm'.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every instance where it is used. The rule can be stated as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" means ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at each example and the corresponding output.

Input: dax walm zup lug walm
Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to green when followed by ""walm,"" which itself corresponds to green then blue.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue
- The placement of ""dax"" is different, yet it still corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" is consistent with yellow, and ""lug"" is consistent with blue.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
- ""dax"" is at the end and corresponds to green even though the preceding words are different (""wif"" and ""bluf"", both corresponding to red).

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" is at the beginning and corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue followed by ""walm,"" which corresponds to blue.

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- ""dax"" appears at the beginning and the end, consistently translating to green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Regardless of the position of the word ""dax"" in the sentence (beginning, middle, or end) and the surrounding words, it consistently translates to ""green."" Based on these examples, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green

Thus, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as green irrespective of its position or the surrounding words in the input.
Considering the provided examples, we can observe a consistent pattern where the input ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". There does not appear to be any context-dependent variation in the output linked to ""wif"". Therefore, based on the given data, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"":

wif -> red

Rule: The output for ""wif"" is always ""red"", regardless of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the instances where it appears alongside the resulting output:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
2. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
4. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
5. Input: lug zup bluf dax -> Output: blue yellow yellow green

Looking at the outputs corresponding to the inputs where ""bluf"" appears, we can conclude that the presence of ""bluf"" results in the doubling of the color that comes after it in the input:

1. ""lug"" comes after ""bluf"" and the output is ""red red""
2. ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"" and the output is ""green green""
3. ""wif"" comes after ""bluf"" and the output includes ""red red""
4. There are no words after ""bluf"" in this example, yet ""red"" is repeated, indicating it's doubling the previously mentioned color ""red"" from ""wif""
5. ""dax"" comes after ""bluf"" again and the output is ""yellow yellow""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to double the color that follows it in the sequence. If no new color follows it (""bluf"" is at the end), it seems to double the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Doubles the color of the following word, or if it's at the end, it doubles the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we have to analyze the outputs following the instances of ""walm"" in the given examples. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""blue red.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""blue.""

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red blue.""

4. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""walm"" is followed by ""blue red red.""

From these examples, it's clear that ""walm"" is associated with the output ""blue"" immediately after it but can also be followed by ""red"" one or more times. Additionally, the number of ""red"" following ""walm"" seems to be dependent on the word that comes after ""walm"".

Rule: ""walm"" correlates to the color ""blue"" immediately following it and also triggers ""red"" one or more times after ""blue"", possibly influenced by subsequent words.

Walm -> ""blue"" followed by varying occurrences of ""red,"" dependent on the context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in a sequence of words, whenever ""dax"" is an input, the output includes ""green.""

Thus, the rule can be formulated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the correspondence between the inputs and their respective outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"".
- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""red"".
- Whenever ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, the output is ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" appears in various combinations but consistently results in the output ""red"".

Thus, examining the consistency across all examples, we can determine that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In each example, whenever the term ""zup"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output. There is no contextual change or dependency on other factors present in the examples given that would affect this interpretation of ""zup."" Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf.""

- In each instance, the word ""bluf"" is preceded by at least one other word.
- The output always contains one color for each word that precedes ""bluf"" and then two colors for ""bluf"" itself.
- The color before ""bluf"" in the output is never repeated after ""bluf"" appears. Instead, ""bluf"" seems to output the color ""blue"" twice.

Let's look at the patterns for each input and output pair:

1. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue
   - Each word before ""bluf"" translates to the color red, but after ""bluf,"" the color is blue, repeated twice.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - The word before ""bluf"" translates to yellow, and ""bluf"" itself is not represented in the output, assuming a one-to-one mapping for the other words.

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - Similar to the previous example, ""zup"" maps to yellow, ""wif"" maps to red, and ""bluf,"" based on the pattern, does not have a direct single output but influences the output of 'red' twice for ""wif.""

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""lug"" maps to blue, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""dax"" to green after ""bluf."" There are two yellows for ""zup,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause a duplication of the preceding color.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - Following the established patterns, ""dax"" maps to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow. After ""bluf,"" the color red associated with ""wif"" appears twice, as does yellow with ""zup"" in the previous example.

Given the consistent duplication of the color related to the word before ""bluf"" and the appearance of blue directly after, we can postulate that ""bluf"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated and outputs the color blue afterward. However, these rules are entirely dependent on the specific sequence of words and colors.

Rule: The word ""bluf"" causes the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to appear twice in the output sequence, and then the sequence continues with the color blue appearing twice. The word ""bluf"" itself does not have a direct color mapping visible in the examples given as it affects the preceding word's output instead. 

Bluf -> meaning: Duplicate the preceding color and append two blue colors.
Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times. 

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green.""
- And so on, with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" leading to the respective repetitions when followed by ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The term ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> meaning. From the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" is present in the output at the corresponding position of ""dax.""

Rule: ""dax"" in input correlates to ""green"" in output.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's identify patterns in the color responses relative to the position and occurrence of the word ""wif"" within each input.

1. When ""wif"" proceeds or follows ""dax,"" it corresponds with red. This is seen in examples:
   - Input: dax wif zup dax -> Output: green red yellow green
   - Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
   - Input: wif dax wif -> Output: red green red

2. When ""wif"" is at the beginning of a sequence, it corresponds with red. Examples:
   - Input: wif walm lug bluf -> Output: red red red blue blue
   - Input: wif zup lug wif -> Output: red yellow blue red

3. Whenever ""wif"" appears, regardless of its position, it seems to correspond with red. Examples:
   - Every input containing ""wif"" leads to an output with red in the position where ""wif"" appears.

From these observations, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color red regardless of its position or the words that precede or follow it in the sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correlation of the word ""bluf"" in the inputs and the corresponding colors in the outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax walm -- Output: red red green green green
2. Input: wif bluf -- Output: red red
3. Input: zup bluf dax -- Output: yellow yellow green
4. Input: zup wif bluf zup -- Output: yellow red red yellow
5. Input: zup bluf lug -- Output: yellow yellow blue

In the given examples, ""bluf"" consistently correlates with ""red"". In the second input, where ""bluf"" is directly followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red red"", showing that ""bluf"" might translate to red regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Additionally, when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" or ""zup,"" these words produce colors consistent with their position in relation to ""bluf."" For instance, ""wif"" is always translated to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is always ""yellow."" The word after ""bluf"" seems to follow a different color pattern: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" is a sequence of ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is as follows:

bluf -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be a rule that causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it three times. This rule seems to be independent of the position of ""walm"" in the input sequence, as its effect is the same regardless of whether it is at the end of the sequence or followed by other words. 

Here is the breakdown of the correlation between the word preceding ""walm"" and the output:

- ""zup walm"" has the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" triggers the triple repetition of ""yellow.""
- ""zup wif walm"" has the output ""yellow red red red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""walm"" triggers the triple repetition of ""red.""
- ""zup dax walm"" has the output ""yellow green green green,"" which suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" triggers the triple repetition of ""green.""
- ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"" has the output ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue,"" where ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" triggers the triple repetition of ""yellow,"" and the final ""wif lug"" corresponds again to ""red blue.""
- ""dax walm"" with the output ""green green green"" confirms that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" triggers the triple repetition of ""green.""

With these observations, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. 

walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" consistently across examples.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs provided.

1. Input: wif dax wif lug wif
   Output: red green red blue red
   - ""wif"" appears before ""dax"" and after ""lug"" and leads to ""red"" both times.
   
2. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - Here ""wif"" is after ""bluf"" and before ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red.""
   
3. Input: lug wif dax wif
   Output: blue red green red
   - ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" and follows ""lug"" with ""red"" as the associated color.

4. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" and leads to ""red.""

5. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   - ""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and results in ""red.""

From these examples, we can identify a pattern where ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" Regardless of the words around it, the output color for ""wif"" is always ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" correlates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples. Every time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. 

Here's how the rule applies in the examples:

1. In ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and therefore translates to ""blue.""
2. In ""dax bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and therefore translates to ""green.""
3. In ""lug bluf,"" ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and therefore translates to ""blue.""
4. In ""zup dax bluf zup dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and therefore translates to ""green.""
5. In ""dax lug zup wif bluf dax,"" ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and therefore translates to ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

bluf -> The color word that immediately precedes it (repeats the previous word's assigned color).

Rule: ""bluf"" represents a repeat of the color word that comes before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   
2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   
3. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   
4. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red
   
5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Let's look for patterns associated with ""walm"":

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, the word that appears directly after ""walm"" is not mentioned in the output (e.g., ""wif walm zup"" results in ""green red red red yellow,"" and ""zup"" appears at the end). This might indicate that ""walm"" causes the omission of the next word in the sequence when determining the corresponding color.
- However, in example 2 (""dax wif walm""), there is no word after ""walm"" to be omitted, but the output is still ""green red red red,"" suggesting that the presence of ""walm"" causes a repetition of the preceding color (in this case ""red"").
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows two instances of ""zup,"" followed by the output ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where the ""blue"" seems to correspond to ""bluf,"" and the ""yellow"" likely corresponds to ""zup."" Given that ""walm"" does not have a word after it to be omitted and is preceded by ""zup,"" it appears that ""walm"" causes ""zup"" to be repeated again in the output as ""yellow"" and does not contribute a new color itself.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes a repeated output of the color that corresponds to the word right before it. If there's a word following ""walm,"" that word is omitted in the output sequence.

Thus the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced as:

walm -> Causes repetition of the previous color and omission of the following word from the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems to be:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the output is ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the occurrence of the word ""zup"" and the corresponding outputs to determine its meaning.

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- ""zup"" first appears and the output is ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""yellow"".
- ""zup"" appears again and the output is ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""yellow"".
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""red"".

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""zup"" follows and the output is ""yellow"".

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""walm"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""zup"" follows and the output is ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- The sequence ""wif walm zup"" repeats with the same color output as before.

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"".
- ""zup"" follows and the output is ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" also corresponds with ""yellow"".

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"".
- ""wif"" corresponds with ""red"".
- ""lug"" and ""walm"" repeat with the corresponding colors.
- ""zup"" appears after ""lug walm"" and the output is ""yellow"".
- ""walm"" and ""wif"" follow with the corresponding colors ""yellow"" and ""red"".

Looking at these examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the outputs for the given inputs where the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, it is clear that whenever ""bluf"" is present, the color ""red"" is output, regardless of its position in the input:

Input: wif bluf lug dax wif -> Output: red red blue green red
Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Input: lug bluf -> Output: blue blue
Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red

Based on this pattern, we can conclude that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" may signify one occurrence of ""green,"" and ""walm"" may add two more occurrences of ""green.""

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to one ""green"" as previously determined, and ""walm"" apparently adds two more ""greens"" in sequence.

Input: zup walm dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow green
- ""zup"" converts to three occurrences of ""yellow,"" then ""walm"" and ""dax"" follow. Since ""dax"" is assumed to mean a single ""green,"" ""walm"" in this case did not add any more ""greens"" but instead maintained the color sequence initiated by ""zup.""

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to three occurrences of ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" ""zup"" (three ""yellow""), ""lug"" (one ""blue""), another ""zup"" (three ""yellow""), and a final ""walm."" In this sequence ""walm"" does not add ""green,"" but it seems to result in continuation or perhaps completion of the color pattern of three matching colors.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" gives three ""yellow,"" ""wif"" gives three ""red,"" and ""walm"" is at the end without introducing a new color or repeating one.

Rule:
Based on the above observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it either (1) repeats the last color mentioned three times or (2) completes the last color sequence to result in a three-color pattern if it hasn't already appeared.

Therefore,
walm -> Repeats or completes the last color to make a sequence of three of the same color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" represents the color blue consistently across all examples provided.
From the examples provided, it looks like each word is associated with a specific color:

- ""bluf"" is consistently associated with blue.
- ""wif"" is consistently associated with red.
- ""zug"" (assuming ""zup"" is a typo based on the context) is consistently associated with yellow.
- ""lug"" is consistently associated with blue.

Now, looking at ""dax"":

- In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zug"" translates to ""green green red yellow,"" which suggests that ""dax"" means green since it is paired with ""bluf"" (blue) but results in green. Every time ""dax"" appears, blue turns to green in the output.
- When ""dax"" appears before other colors, it doesn't change their associated output colors – red and yellow remain consistent (as with ""wif"" and ""zug"").

So the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to or results in the color green when it appears before a word that would normally translate to blue like ""bluf"" or ""lug"" and doesn't affect the translation of other colors. But since ""lug"" translates to blue and so does ""bluf"", and when ""dax"" is in front it turns the translation to green, ""dax"" does not have a one-to-one associated color but rather changes the following color to green if it would have been blue. 

Rule: When ""dax"" precedes a word that translates to blue, the output color turns to green. It otherwise does not affect the translation of other colors.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each case, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> blue

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the word ""bluf.""

In all given examples, the word ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word. Let's examine each case:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" which results in another ""yellow."" 

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" which results in another ""green.""

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Similar to the first case, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is immediately followed by ""bluf,"" resulting in another ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" yielding another ""green."" 

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   In this sequence, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and as per the observed rule, ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" as well. 

Considering this information, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the word following it to repeat the color of the word preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" must mean ""yellow,"" as it's the only word before ""walm"" and we get three ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""dax"" precedes ""zup"" and ""walm,"" and we see that green is added before ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which suggests that ""dax"" could be ""green."" ""wif"" at the end gives us ""red,"" so ""wif"" may mean ""red.""

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" is followed by a ""blue,"" so ""lug"" likely means ""blue."" The rest of the sequence remains consistent with previous deductions.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug walm
   Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
   - ""dax walm"" at the beginning results in ""green green green,"" which means that ""walm"" could mean repeating the color word that comes before it thrice. ""lug walm"" then turns into ""blue blue blue,"" supporting this idea.

5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Again, ""dax walm"" gives us ""green green green."" ""wif"" still means ""red,"" and ""lug dax walm"" gives us ""blue green green green."" This indicates that ""walm"" repeats the color word before it three more times, overriding the ""blue"" from ""lug.""

Based on the analysis, ""walm"" seems to cause the most recent color word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color word three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the word ""dax"" can be deduced by looking at the corresponding output colors. Here are the observations:

1. Every instance where ""dax"" is present, the output color is ""green"".
2. The word ""dax"" does not always appear in the same position, yet the color ""green"" is consistently associated with it.

Given these observations, it seems that the word ""dax"" correlates with the color ""green"". 

Therefore, the rule appears to be: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> yellow when following zup, blue when following lug, and red when following wif. 

Rule: The color represented by ""bluf"" is determined by the word directly preceding it. If it is preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to red, if preceded by ""lug,"" it translates to blue, and if preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to yellow.
In each example, the output consists of a series of colors. Each color in the output corresponds to a word in the input:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. The repetition occurs a set number of times (three) for the color linked to the preceding word before we see a shift to a new color from a new word (if any):

Input: zup walm wif        Output: yellow yellow yellow red
Input: dax walm zup lug    Output: green green green yellow blue
Input: dax walm            Output: green green green
Input: zup walm            Output: yellow yellow yellow
Input: dax walm wif walm zup    Output: green green green red red red yellow

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif"":

Rule: 
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red.""
- When ""wif"" occurs, it does not appear to modify the following word or depend on context; it generates the output ""red"" consistently.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"", we should look for the constant pattern in the presence of ""zup"" and compare the outputs to see if there's a consistent mapping.

In all the inputs where ""zup"" appears, the output is always ""yellow"" in the corresponding position:

- Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
- Input: zup dax lug wif dax -> Output: yellow green blue red green
- Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- Input: lug walm zup wif -> Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, the output color at that position is always ""yellow"". There's no variation tied to sequence or context based on the examples provided.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to a color output that is dependent on a specific rule related to the preceding word(s). To deduce the rule for ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- Whenever ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" without any word in between them, the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""
- No example is provided where ""wif"" directly precedes ""bluf,"" so a direct rule for that cannot be deduced.

From these examples, it can be observed that ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- lug -> blue, so if ""lug"" comes right before ""bluf,"" then bluf -> yellow (Output: blue yellow yellow)
- dax -> green, so if ""dax"" comes right before ""bluf,"" then bluf -> green (Output: green green)
- zup -> yellow, so if ""zup"" comes right before ""bluf,"" then bluf -> yellow (Output: yellow yellow)

Since ""bluf"" consistently outputs the same color as the word before it, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the preceding word.
Analyzing inputs and corresponding outputs, the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a repetition of the color that precedes it in the sequence. Let us verify this pattern:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is repeating the color ""blue"" three times.
- In the second example, the pattern holds as ""lug walm"" again translates to ""blue blue blue.""
- The third example corroborates this. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green.""
- The fourth example also shows ""walm"" following this rule; ""walm"" is following ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" (red), and ""dax"" (green), each time repeating the color three times.
- The fifth example, ""zup walm,"" repeats the color yellow three times.

Based on these observations, we deduce the following rule:

walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to repeat the immediately preceding color three times.

Rule: walm repeats the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color blue in each given example.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" every time it appears.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the respective position in the output. Furthermore, other nonce words such as ""dax"", ""wif"", ""lug"", and ""walm"" correspond to different colors, with ""dax"" translating to ""green"", ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""walm"" translating to the color ""blue"" repeated for each instance of ""walm"" in the input. Therefore, the rule seems to be that each nonce word consistently represents a specific color in the output.

zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" does not correspond to a consistent color output. Here is an analysis of the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue

2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red

3. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
   Output: blue red red blue red

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" However, in the second example, ""bluf"" results in the color ""red,"" the same as ""wif."" In the third example, ""bluf"" again outputs ""red."" In the fourth example, there is no ""bluf""; however, ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"" outputs following a ""zup."" In the last example, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both produce ""green."" 

One possible rule is that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the adjacent words within the string, except when it precedes ""lug."" This holds true for the second and third examples where ""bluf"" takes on the color of ""wif."" However, given that there is no adjacent word in the fifth example to influence ""bluf,"" and it pairs with ""dax"" to output ""green,"" this rule cannot fully explain the behavior of ""bluf.""

Given the inconsistencies, it is challenging to deduce a definitive rule that ""bluf"" consistently follows with the information provided. Nonetheless, the closest rule we can surmise so far might be:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" is context-dependent; it may imitate the color of an adjacent word unless it is followed by ""lug,"" in which case it results in ""blue."" However, without a consistent pattern for ""bluf"" in all examples, this rule has exceptions and doesn't account for all cases.
walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it means you should repeat thrice the color associated with that preceding word. In the examples, ""lug"" is associated with the color blue, and ""dax"" is associated with the color green. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" and when ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""green green green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of ""lug"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the outputs.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" doubles the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the rule broken down by example:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the output.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the output.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
Rule: ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" triples the output of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" doubles the preceding color, ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""walm"" triples the output of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
Rule: Similar to the second input, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" doubles the output of that color.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be: ""bluf"" doubles the output of the color specified by the word immediately before it.

bluf -> meaning. Rule: Doubles the output of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Analyzing the examples and the corresponding outputs allows us to attempt to discern the pattern and then define the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

Here are the examples with their outputs again:

1. Input: dax walm              | Output: green green green
2. Input: dax lug walm          | Output: green blue blue blue
3. Input: zup wif dax walm lug  | Output: yellow red green green green blue
4. Input: wif walm dax zup      | Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm | Output: green green green red blue green green green

Let's analyze the patterns:

- Whenever ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" we get an additional ""green"" in the output. Likewise, if ""dax"" repeats before ""walm"" again, it results in another set of ""green green green.""
- ""Lug"" seems to add ""blue"" to the output and the number of ""blues"" depends on the words between ""lug"" and ""walm"" (or possibly the proximity of ""lug"" to ""walm"").
- When ""walm"" is directly after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" twice, suggesting that ""wif"" might modify the output associated with ""walm.""

Let's propose a tentative rule:
- ""walm"" seems to add multiple instances of the color associated with the word that precedes it:
  - If preceded immediately by ""dax,"" ""walm"" produces ""green green green.""
  - If ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" it produces ""red red red.""
  - The presence of ""lug"" before ""walm"" without any intervening colors suggests it may produce multiple instances of ""blue"" based on its position or the number of words separating ""walm"" from ""lug.""

Hence, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the word preceding it, with the number of replications potentially being influenced by the presence of intervening words or specific word combinations.

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with the count influenced by word combinations or specific preceding words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color 'green', regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Each example including the word 'dax' always results in the word 'green' in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" When it is used with other nonce words, the other nonce words are translated to their corresponding colors following the pattern established in the examples. If ""wif"" appears alone, then the output is simply ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output. There are no examples where ""zup"" leads to a different word, color, or meaning in the output, indicating a consistent one-to-one correspondence.

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
From the examples provided, it's possible to observe that every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output color matches the color of the word that immediately precedes it:

- In the first example, ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, and ""bluf"" follows, which is also translated as yellow.
- In the second example, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times ""bluf"" results in yellow.
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both ""lug"" and ""bluf"" correspond to blue.
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both are translated as blue.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" and both are associated with the color green.

Given these observations, we can infer the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: bluf takes on the color value of the word directly preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to repeat the previously mentioned color word. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it repeats the color associated with the word immediately before it, for as many times as ""lug"" repeats in the sequence. Here are the rules identified:

- ""lug"" correlates with the color blue.
- ""wif"" correlates with the color red.
- ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow.
- ""dax"" correlates with the color green.
- ""walm"" takes the last color word mentioned and repeats its color.

Applying this rule to the examples:

1. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow, ""walm"" repeats yellow, and ""lug"" is blue.

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue thrice.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue twice.

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" repeats yellow thrice.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repetition of the last mentioned color, the number of repetitions being equal to the number of times ""lug"" appears after ""walm"", or once if ""lug"" does not appear after ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule by looking for patterns and consistencies in the input-output pairs.

Input: lug walm zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"" in the output.

Input: lug
Output: blue
- When ""lug"" occurs by itself, the output is ""blue.""

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
- ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in every instance it occurs.

From every example where the word ""lug"" appears, it consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. There are no examples given that show ""lug"" corresponding to any other color or pattern of colors. Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer a rule by comparing the positions of the word ""dax"" and the corresponding output colors.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: dax wif
Output: green red

In all instances where ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green"". This suggests that ""dax"" maps to ""green"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word 'wif' is equivalent to the color 'red'.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine a pattern for the meaning of ""zup"" within the context in question. 

For each example:

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Here, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, while ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow.

Input: zup
Output: yellow
Here, ""zup"" on its own still corresponds to yellow.

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
Here, ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""zup"" still corresponds to yellow.

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
Again, ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.

Based on these examples, ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position within the input or surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red when it follows any word; it duplicates the color of the word that precedes it.
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position.
2. ""dax"" always translates to ""green"" regardless of its position.
3. ""wif"" translates to either ""red"" or starts a repetition of ""red"" that is broken by another color word.

When looking at ""walm,"" we can see if it carries a repetitive nature or if it translates directly to a color. Let's analyze how ""walm"" behaves in the given examples:

- Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red

From these examples, we note that ""walm"" seems to initiate a repetition of the color that immediately precedes it. In the first case, ""lug"" is blue and is followed by ""walm""; the output is ""blue blue blue"". In the second, ""wif"" (which seems to be associated with ""red"") precedes ""walm"" resulting in ""red red red"". In the third example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which means ""green"", and both instances of ""walm"" are followed by repeated ""green"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color word that directly precedes it. 

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the repetition of the previous color word's output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever you see the word ""lug,"" you should replace it with the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following rules for the nonce word ""dax"" and how it translates to the output colors:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"" at the corresponding position.
2. The other words, such as ""wif"", ""walm"", ""lug"", and ""zup"", seem to correspond to red, green, blue, and yellow, respectively. This indicates that these words have a direct translation to a particular color. 
3. When ""dax"" appears alongside these words, it does not change their corresponding color outputs. 

Hence, the rule we can derive:

Rule: dax -> green

This implies that ""dax,"" regardless of its position or the context within a sequence, consistently means ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's analyze the examples provided and look for patterns:

1. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

4. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

Now, let's look for the position and corresponding output for ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" is in the second position, the output is ""red"" in the second position (Examples 1, 3).
- When ""wif"" is in the third position, the output is ""red"" in the third position (Example 2).
- When ""wif"" is in both the first and third positions, the output is ""red"" in both the first and third positions (Example 4).
- When ""wif"" is alone with one other word, the output is ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the other word (Example 5).

From this pattern, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the pattern, and its position in the input corresponds directly to the position of ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow."" This relationship holds regardless of the context or placement in the sentence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: Bluf means ""repeat the color that corresponds to the previously mentioned nonce word.""

Examples:
- In ""zup bluf wif lug dax"", `zup` corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when `bluf` follows, it repeats ""yellow."" 
- In ""zup wif bluf zup lug"", `wif` corresponds to ""red,"" and when `bluf` follows, it repeats ""red"". 
- In ""zup bluf"", there's only `zup` before `bluf`, and it corresponds to ""yellow,"" so `bluf` repeats ""yellow"" again. 
- In ""zup wif bluf"", `wif` precedes `bluf` and corresponds to ""red,"" so `bluf` repeats ""red"". 
- In ""dax zup bluf"", `zup` precedes `bluf` and corresponds to ""yellow,"" hence `bluf` repeats ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule for bluf is: Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding `bluf`.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output. To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will look at each instance where it occurs and the corresponding color it translates to in the output.

In the first example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
""Walm"" corresponds to the last three ""red"" colors since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red.""

In the second example:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
Here ""walm"" corresponds to the second and third ""red."" ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow.""

In the third example:
Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
""Walm"" corresponds to the three ""blue"" colors since other colors can be matched with other words and ""zup"" is repeated at the end with the same color ""yellow.""

In the fourth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
This example is identical to the first and gives the same color outputs with ""walm"" once again translating to three ""red.""

In the fifth example:
Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Here, ""walm"" appears twice, each time corresponding to three consecutive colors. In the first instance, those colors are ""red,"" and in the second, they are ""blue.""

From these examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color immediately before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine the inputs and outputs to identify the pattern:

1. Input: wif lug | Output: red blue
2. Input: dax wif lug | Output: green red blue
3. Input: zup dax lug | Output: yellow green blue
4. Input: lug dax | Output: blue green
5. Input: zup lug dax | Output: yellow blue green

In examples 1 and 2, the presence of ""wif"" before ""lug"" results in ""red"" appearing before ""blue"" in the output. In examples 2 and 3, the presence of ""dax"" before ""lug"" results in ""green"" appearing before ""blue"" in the output.

When ""lug"" appears before ""dax,"" as in example 4, the output sequence is reversed, with ""green"" following ""blue."" This is also consistent in example 5, when ""zup"" is present at the beginning; ""yellow"" precedes the ""blue green"" sequence, suggesting that the relative order of ""blue"" and ""green"" changes depending on the position of ""lug.""

Considering these observations, we can deduce:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" with the requirement that if ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is added after ""blue"" in the output. If ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" comes before ""blue."" If ""wif"" is present, add ""red"" before ""blue,"" and if ""zup"" is present, add ""yellow"" before the sequence generated by ""lug"" and ""dax.""

Therefore, lug -> blue (with the positional rule affecting the order of blue and green).
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs directly translates to ""red"" in the outputs. Also, other words correlate with different colors consistently - ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Additionally, ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the previous color mentioned.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that the output repeats the color that comes immediately before ""bluf"". Here are the instances that support this conclusion:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to red. After ""bluf,"" red is repeated.
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" and red is repeated.
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" and yellow is repeated.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" and red is repeated.
- In the final example, ""zup"" is before ""bluf,"" and yellow is repeated once more.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is to repeat the previous color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color that precedes ""bluf"".
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to relate to both the words that precede it and a repetition of color words in the output. From the inputs and outputs provided, we can deduce the following pairings:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red.""
- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green.""

The word ""walm"" seems to trigger the repetition of the last color word in the output the number of times equal to the total number of words that preceded it, excluding ""walm"" itself. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" -> ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and since ""lug"" is the only word before ""walm,"" ""walm"" triggers the repetition of blue once: ""blue blue blue.""
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" -> ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and there are two words before ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated twice: ""yellow red red red.""
- In the third example, ""lug dax walm"" -> ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and there are two words before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated twice: ""blue green green green.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug zup dax walm"" -> ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and there are three words before ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated three times: ""blue yellow green green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" it appears that ""bluf"" is an anomaly because it does not correspond to any of the other known colors or rules as ""bluf"" isn't provided in the output. However, the existence of ""wif"" in the sequence tells us it should begin with ""red,"" followed by ""red"" for the undefined ""bluf,"" and then ""green"" for ""dax,"" with ""green"" repeated two additional times due to the two words before ""dax,"" resulting in: ""red red green green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be: walm -> triggers the repetition of the color word corresponding to the last word before ""walm,"" repeated as many times as the total number of words that preceded ""walm"" (excluding ""walm"").

Rule:
""walm"" -> repeat the last color word before ""walm"" a number of times equal to the count of words preceding ""walm"" (excluding ""walm"" itself).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the context provided by surrounding words, ""wif"" always maps to the color ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""wif"" within the scope of these examples is directly associated with the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the repeated mention of the color associated with the word that immediately follows it.

Let's look at how this rule plays out in each example:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""bluf"" is associated with the color yellow, which is repeated twice.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" is associated with the color yellow, which is repeated three times after ""zup.""

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color red, which is repeated three times after ""zup.""

4. Input: lug walm zup
   Output: blue blue blue yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" is followed by no words, and ""walm"" is associated with yellow, which only appears once; thus, this example doesn't directly support the rule but doesn't contradict it either.

5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   - ""wif"" is associated with the color red, which is repeated three times.

Based on this analysis, the rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color associated with the next word in the sequence, the same number of times as the word 'walm' occurs in the input sequence. If 'walm' is not present, repeat once.

Please note that example 4 does not follow the established pattern and may imply that ""zup"" simply means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word once — if there is no subsequent word that can be identified. Further examples would help to solidify the exact rule of ""zup.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

For instance, when we see ""bluf"" in the outputs, we always see ""red"":

- Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green -> bluf corresponds to the last ""green"" which should be ""red"" based on this pattern.
- Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> Output: red red yellow red blue green -> bluf corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.
- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green -> bluf corresponds to the sixth ""red"" in the output.
- Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green -> bluf corresponds to the second ""green"" which should be ""red"" based on this pattern.
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green -> bluf corresponds to the third and fifth ""blue"" which should be ""red"" based on this pattern.

However, there's a discrepancy in the first and fourth examples, where ""bluf"" is translated to ""green"" instead of ""red"". If the rule were that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" consistently, these outputs would be incorrect. It is possible that there is an error in the provided examples, or there might be another rule that has not been made clear. This could be due to contextual changes or dependencies not visible with the given examples.

Given the evidence from the majority of examples, the tentative rule is:

Rule: bluf -> red

Note: For full accuracy, more examples or clarification on the discrepancy would be needed.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to three outputs of the same color, following the color associated with the preceding word, with the colors corresponding to specific words as follows:

- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Thus, we can interpret ""walm"" as a rule that repeats the color associated with the previous word three times. Using the examples to affirm this:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule: ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, and ""walm"" repeats red three times.

2. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""zup"" is yellow, ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   Rule: ""wif"" is red, ""walm"" repeats red three times, ""dax"" is green, ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

4. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" is blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   Rule: ""dax"" is green, ""lug"" is blue, ""walm"" repeats blue three times, ""zup"" is yellow, and ""wif"" is red.

Therefore, the rule is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
By examining the examples provided and the changes in the output when ""lug"" is present, it's possible to figure out what ""lug"" means in terms of the output. In each occurrence, ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Here ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""walm"" to three occurrences of ""blue"". ""lug"" appears once and it corresponds to one ""blue"".

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""lug"" appears once at the beginning and the output starts with ""blue"". ""zup"" appears once and translates to ""yellow"".

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" at the end translates to ""blue"". ""lug"" in between translates to ""blue"".

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue
- The first and last ""lug"" corresponds to the first and last ""blue"" and ""dax"" in the middle corresponds to ""green"".

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green
- The sequence opens and closes with ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". ""lug"" follows the first ""dax"" and corresponds to ""blue"". ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and corresponds to ""yellow"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by ""bluf"" which also corresponds to ""red"".

Rule:
lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in an input, the output consistently includes the color green in the corresponding position.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on analysis of the examples provided, the word 'zup' conveys a consistent meaning. In each instance where 'zup' is used, the output is 'yellow'. There are no cases in the examples where 'zup' corresponds to any other color or rule dependence; therefore, it stands to reason that the word 'zup' translates directly to the color 'yellow'.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" correlates with the word ""yellow"" in the outputs. Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided, we can analyze the relationship between the input words and the output colors to deduce what the nonce word ""walm"" means in terms of the color in the output.

- In Example 1, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue."" ""Lug"" alone might map to ""blue.""
- In Example 2, ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" might map to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" and ""wif"" each map to ""red,"" this suggests that ""walm"" also maps to ""red.""
- In Example 3, ""dax walm wif bluf"" results in ""green green green red red."" ""Dax"" seems to map to ""green,"" and as established, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" map to ""red."" Hence, ""walm"" could map to ""green.""
- However, Example 2 and Example 3 together suggest that ""walm"" does not map to a single color but rather repeats the color of the word that comes before it.
- Example 4 further supports this as ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" results in ""red red green green red red red blue red,"" and the ""walm"" generates ""red,"" repeating the ""red"" of the preceding ""wif."" 
- Example 5 shows that when ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" the repeated color is ""green.""

From this pattern, it seems that the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color represented by the word immediately preceding it. Thus:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times, specifically three times based on the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" consistently in each example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Every occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, we need to deduce the meaning of the word “wif.” Let's examine the input and output pairs:

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" precedes ""zup,"" which results in the output “red yellow.”

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

Here, ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" and it results in “yellow red.” Notice that the colors are reversed compared to the first example, suggesting that the position of ""wif"" relative to ""zup"" may determine the order of the colors.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red

""Wif"" is followed by ""walm,"" and we don't see ""wif"" leading to a color directly associated with it. Instead, ""wif"" is followed by multiple ""red"" occurrences, but we cannot directly correlate those with the presence of ""wif"" without more data. However, it's noticeable that none of the other words repeat a color, implying that ""wif"" could mean a repetition of the following color.

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

This example is the same as the second example, reinforcing our previous observation of the order of colors with the positioning of ""wif.""

5. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

""Wif"" is at the end of the sequence, and the color after ""lug"" is ""blue,"" yet ""wif"" translates to ""red"" despite being after ""lug."" This suggests that ""wif"" is not merely a translation to the color ""red"" but may be influenced by the surrounding words.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""wif"" may not correspond directly to a single color. Instead, ""wif"" may be a function word that impacts the pattern or sequence of colors. The first two examples show an influence on ordering, while the third example might hint at repetition. The fifth example again challenges direct correlation, indicating the potential for more complex rules.

Rule: Given the data, the meaning of the word “wif” is not consistent across the examples which means a definitive rule cannot be established without further information. ""Wif"" may involve a pattern or sequencing function rather than translating directly to a specific color. More examples would be needed to deduce a clearer rule for ""wif.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples demonstrate a consistent pattern where the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly translates to the color that precedes it. In the first example, ""lug bluf"" equates to ""blue blue"", and in the second, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"". This pattern follows through all the examples.

Rule: bluf -> the same color word that precedes it. If no color precedes it, then bluf defaults to yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine each example and the corresponding output, trying to find a pattern for the word ""walm"":

1. Input: lug walm zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow red

2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue

5. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue

Looking at all the examples, we can observe the following:

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Now, examining the outputs where ""walm"" appears, it always seems to produce a series of the color that was mentioned just before it, repeated for the rest of the sequence:

1. ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the blue.
2. ""wif"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red,"" repeating the red.
3. ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm"" and the output is ""green blue blue blue,"" where blue is repeated after ""lug"".
4. ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" repeating the yellow.
5. ""lug"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output after ""lug"" is ""blue blue blue,"" again repeating blue.

Therefore, the rule seems to be: walm -> repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" for the rest of the sequence.

Rule: walm -> repeat the last mentioned color for the rest of the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm wif walm dax lug dax
    ",Output: green green green red red red green blue green,green green green red red red green blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" across all the examples given, regardless of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input-output examples provided. 

Input: dax
Output: green
- This suggests that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" repeats the color given for ""dax"", hence ""green green green"".

Input: lug dax
Output: blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""

Input: lug dax lug
Output: blue green blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""
- The repeated ""lug"" at the end corresponds to ""blue"" again, consistently with its first occurrence.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" repeats the color given for ""dax"", hence ""green green green"".

Based on these observations, ""dax"" consistently maps to the color ""green"" whenever it appears. Additionally, the word ""walm"" seems to trigger a repetition of the color assigned to ""dax.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color output. Let's break down each input and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- Here, 'wif' results in 'red', as does 'bluf'.

Input: dax lug dax wif dax
Output: green blue green red green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and 'wif' again results in 'red'.

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
- 'wif' results in 'red', 'bluf' gives 'red' again, and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'.

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
Output: blue red red green blue blue
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue', 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'bluf' corresponds to 'red', and 'dax' corresponds to 'green'.

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', 'bluf' to 'yellow' again (note the divergence from the first pattern where 'bluf' corresponded to 'red'), and 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

The inconsistencies regarding the output of ""bluf"" indicate that the color output does not solely depend on the nonce word but may also depend on the word's position or the context within the sequence.

With the evidence provided, the most consistent rule is that 'wif' always results in the output of 'red', regardless of its position or surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
Analyzing the examples provided, let's deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""zup.""

1. In every instance where ""zup"" is present, the output includes ""yellow.""
2. The presence of ""zup"" in a sequence does not affect the colors associated with other words; ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue,"" ""dax"" in ""green,"" and ""wif"" in ""red.""
3. ""Zup"" does not seem to change its meaning based on its position in the sequence.

Considering these observations, ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" each time it appears in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word `bluf` consistently translates to the color `yellow`. It does not appear to change meaning based on the position in the sentence or the surrounding words. The direct translation is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Examining the relationship between the input and output in each example, we can start by comparing them one by one to understand how ""walm"" affects the output:

1. Input: ""dax wif walm"" Output: ""green red red red""
2. Input: ""lug walm"" Output: ""blue blue blue""
3. Input: ""dax lug walm"" Output: ""green blue blue blue""
4. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug"" Output: ""yellow red green green green blue""
5. Input: ""zup walm"" Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""

Looking at the relationship between inputs and outputs, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in the output of a sequence of the same color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. Each word appears to have a color associated with it: ""dax"" with green, ""lug"" with blue, and ""zup"" with yellow. The presence of ""walm"" after a color word causes a repetition of the corresponding color.

Therefore, the rule regarding ""walm"" appears as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the associated color (dependent on the preceding word) to occur in the output.

So, walm -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax lug
    ",Output: blue green blue,blue green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. In every example, the presence of the word ""dax"" results in the word ""green"" in the output. There is no modification or condition apparent that changes what ""dax"" means in different contexts; it consistently translates to ""green"".

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the other words present in the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output always starts with the color ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" causes the output color to repeat the color that the immediately preceding word represents. For instance:

- In ""wif bluf lug zup,"" ""wif"" outputs red, and ""bluf"" causes the red to repeat, resulting in ""red red.""
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""zup"" outputs yellow, and ""bluf"" causes that color to repeat once, resulting in ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""zup"" outputs yellow, and ""bluf"" causes that color to repeat once, giving us ""yellow yellow.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to repeat the color output of the word immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color output of the word immediately before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look for patterns in the inputs and their respective outputs. Let's examine the correlation between the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input and the resulting colors in the output.

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - Following ""walm,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times, although ""wif,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" map to different colors.

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""Walm"" is preceded by different words, yet ""red"" is repeated three times, similar to how ""blue"" followed ""walm"" in the first example.

3. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - Directly after ""walm,"" the color ""red"" is repeated three times before changing to ""green"" for ""dax.""

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   - The pattern is consistent: ""walm"" is followed by three occurrences of ""red"" then changes as new words are introduced.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - Again, following ""walm,"" the word ""blue"" is repeated three times before changing to ""red"" for ""wif.""

Based on these examples, it appears that the rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times in the output. 

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears, take the color assigned to the word directly before ""walm"" and repeat that color three times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, where each instance of ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue"" in the output, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". In each example, regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""zup"" translates to the color yellow each time it appears. There does not seem to be any variation or condition that alters this result. Each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence of words.

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning or rule underlying the word ""walm,"" we should analyze the input and corresponding output positions. Let's lay out the available data for clarity:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug | Output: yellow red green green green blue
3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup | Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup | Output: green green green red red red yellow
5. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue

Observations:

- Every time ""walm"" appears, the color immediately following it in the output is ""green” (Examining output for 1, 2, 3, and 4).
- ""Walm"" appears at the end of the input sequence in example 2, followed by ""green"" as the next color, then ""blue"" for ""lug"" which is the next word in the input sequence.
- ""Walm"" appears twice in a row in example 4, and the output for both is ""green green"" followed by ""red,"" which corresponds to ""wif.""
- In example 5, where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that the meaning of ""walm"" is consistent regardless of preceding words.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following:

Rule: The appearance of ""walm"" in the input results in the output of ""green"" immediately after its position.

Thus, the rule can be stated as:

walm -> green

This means that whenever ""walm"" is used in the input, the immediate output should be ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue each time it appears in the input.
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""

Here is how each input relates to its output:

- ""zup wif bluf zup"" to ""yellow red red yellow"" suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also to ""red.""
- ""wif"" by itself outputs ""red.""
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red,"" which shows a one-to-one correspondence for ""zup"" to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- ""dax wif"" becoming ""green red"" indicates ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and confirms ""wif"" as ""red.""
- ""lug wif zup wif"" outputting ""blue red yellow red"" suggests ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and further corroborates that both instances of ""wif"" represent ""red,"" with ""zup"" again being ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf.""

From the first example:
""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
We see that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the Output twice, despite there being only one ""bluf"" in the Input.

From the second example:
""dax bluf"" -> ""green green""
Here we see that ""bluf"" does not generate any ""blue"" in the Output, hinting that ""bluf"" may not always translate directly to ""blue.""

From the third example:
""wif bluf lug dax wif"" -> ""red red blue green red""
Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" and before ""dax"" and it translates to ""blue"" once in the Output.

From the fourth example:
""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
In this sequence, ""bluf"" occurs at the end and only results in one ""red.""

From the fifth example:
""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
In this sequence, ""bluf"" generates ""blue"" once in the Output.

Analysing the patterns, we can observe several things:
1. The word ""bluf"" doesn't consistently translate to a specific color.
2. The output color seems to follow a sequence influenced by the surrounding words.
3. Each Input word corresponds to a specific color in the Output, but ""bluf"" seems to be affected by the words around it.

Let's try to work out the rule:
- ""wif"" corresponds consistently to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds consistently to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds consistently to ""blue.""
- ""bluf"" appears to trigger the color sequence of the following word once more, essentially doubling it.

Rule:
bluf -> repeats the color output of the following word once more. If there is no following word, ""bluf"" generates the color ""red.""
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"", we should look at the relationship between the inputs and the outputs. Let's break down each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" maps to ""yellow red""
   
2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   
3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   
4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" maps to ""yellow red""
   
5. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" followed by ""wif"" maps to ""yellow red""
   
Notice that after each occurrence of ""walm,"" the color that is outputted corresponds to the color of the word preceding ""walm.""

- In example 1, ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and the next word is ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""zup"" comes before ""walm,"" and the next words are ""yellow.""
- In example 3, ""dax"" comes before ""walm,"" and the next words are ""green.""
- In example 4, ""lug"" comes before “walm,” and the next word is ""blue.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" does not have a direct color mapping, but the sequence still follows after ""walm,"" leading to ""red.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it the number of times until the next new word. In other words, ""walm"" extends the output color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color output of the word before it, until a new unique word is encountered.

Let's see if this holds true:

1. dax (green) lug (blue) walm (blue, as lug is blue) zup (blue, as walm continues lug's blue) wif (yellow red)
2. lug (blue) zup (yellow) walm (yellow, extends zup's yellow) lug (blue)
3. dax (green) walm (green, extends dax's green)
4. lug (blue) walm (blue, as lug is blue) zup (blue, as walm continues lug's blue) lug (blue) zup (yellow) wif (yellow red)
5. zup (yellow) bluf (contentious, but let's assume it is another color word with output yellow red) wif (continues the red) walm (continues the red, as wif is red)

It appears the rule we deduced is consistent with all the given examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue,yellow green green green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""dax"" always corresponds to the output ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look for patterns in the given examples.

In the first example:
Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red

In this instance, ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output includes ""blue red,"" which suggests that ""wif"" on its own doesn't correspond to a single specific color, as ""bluf"" directly translates to ""blue."" There is an extra ""red"" appearing after ""blue"" in the output.

Let's proceed:

In the second example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" indicating that ""wif"" could mean ""red"" when it appears at the end of the input list.

In the third example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

Similar to the second example, ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red"" again.

In the fourth example:
Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green

The sequence ""bluf wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" with an additional ""red"" before ""blue."" It seems ""wif"" before a color adds ""red"" before that color in the output.

In the fifth example:
Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Again, the presence of ""wif"" before ""lug"" results in ""red blue"" in the output.

From these observations, we can induce that the word ""wif"" seems to insert the color ""red"" before the color that directly follows it. 

Rule: wif -> inserts the color ""red"" before the next color.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a repetition indicator for the color word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, if a color word is followed by ""bluf,"" the output is that color word repeated.

Here is how the rule applies to the examples:

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Rule Application: ""wif"" means red, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the repetition.

2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   Rule Application: ""zup"" means yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the repetition of yellow. ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""dax"" is green.

3. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   Rule Application: ""lug"" means blue, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the repetition of blue.

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Rule Application: ""zup"" means yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the repetition of yellow.

5. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Rule Application: ""wif"" is red, ""lug"" is blue, and ""zup"" is yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the repetition of the last color word, yellow.

Rule:
bluf -> causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" examine the number of words in the output compared to the input and the colors that correspond to the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input:

Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
Input: lug walm zup | Output: blue blue blue yellow
Input: zup dax walm | Output: yellow green green green
Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: dax walm wif | Output: green green green red

From the outputs, we can observe the following patterns whenever ""walm"" appears in the input:
1. The output has one more word than the input.
2. The color repeated three times corresponds to the presence of ""walm.""

We can hypothesize that ""walm"" could mean to repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times in the output. Let's check:

- In the first and second inputs, ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the third input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fourth input, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""yellow"" is repeated three times; ""lug"" at the end is not followed by ""walm"" and is therefore rendered as a single ""blue.""
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" again, resulting in ""green"" repeated three times.

This pattern explains every example. Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax bluf wif
    ",Output: green green red,green green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Based on the examples given, every time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the provided input and corresponding output examples. Let's analyze the relationship between each input and its output.

Here are the examples along with the direct conversions we can infer:
1. lug dax lug -> blue green blue:
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" stands between two ""lug"" words and corresponds to ""green.""

2. dax wif zup dax -> green red yellow green:
   - ""dax"" at the start and end corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

3. dax walm -> green green green:
   - ""dax"" converts to ""green.""
   - ""walm"" causes repetitive ""green"" possibly, because it converts to ""green"" itself or it's a modifier that means ""repeat previous.""

4. zup lug zup wif dax -> yellow blue yellow red green:
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""dax"" at the end corresponds to ""green.""

5. wif zup dax bluf -> red yellow green green:
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""bluf"" might be a typo or another word, but it resulted in ""green."" If it was a modifier, we would need to see a consistent effect in other examples, which we do not.

From every use of ""dax"" in the input, the output is consistently ""green,"" regardless of its position in the string. Therefore, ""dax"" correlates directly to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we will examine its occurrences and the corresponding outputs.

1. When ""zup"" occurs alone:
   - Input: zup
   - Output: yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow"".

2. When ""zup"" occurs with ""dax"":
   - Input: zup dax zup
   - Output: yellow green yellow
   When ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" it still corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. When ""zup"" occurs with ""dax"" and other words:
   - Input: zup walm dax lug
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   Here ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" while ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" still to ""green."" ""walm"" appears to produce an output that repeats the previous color which in this case is ""yellow.""

4. When ""zup"" appears with multiple other words, including ""wif"":
   - Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   In this case, ""zup"" is still ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" remains ""green,"" and ""wif"" introduces a new color ""red."" ""walm"" again appears to repeat the color before it which is ""blue.""

5. When ""zup"" appears with ""lug"" and ""dax"":
   - Input: zup lug zup dax
   - Output: yellow blue yellow green
   Once again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The second ""zup"" remains consistent with ""yellow.""

Based on the above observations, regardless of the surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare each input with its corresponding output.

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In this example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Noticing the pattern, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" following ""wif.""

2. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

Here, ""zup"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""yellow."" Following that, ""wif"" becomes ""red"" and ""dax"" as ""green,"" which are consistent with the previous example.

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

In this instance, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" followed by ""bluf"" also corresponding to ""green."" Then ""wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" Again, the pattern is consistent with ""bluf"" matching the color that comes before it.

4. Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue

Once more, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""bluf"" also to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From these observations, it appears that the word ""bluf"" always takes on the same color as the word before it. It's essentially repeating the color that comes directly before ""bluf"" in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word preceding it multiple times. To illustrate:

1. In the first example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" the word just before ""walm"" is ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and then ""walm"" results in ""red red.""

2. In the second example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" repeating the color associated with ""lug"" three times.

3. In the third example, ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so the output upon ""walm"" is ""green green green.""

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. The last example, ""dax walm wif dax,"" shows that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is ""green,"" and then continues to follow the pattern for the subsequent words.

Rule: walm -> The function of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it multiple times (in these examples, three times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of dax correlates with the word ""green"" in the output. The word that precedes dax does not seem to influence its meaning, as dax always translates to green regardless of its position or surrounding words. Also, other words consistently refer to their respective colors: zup to yellow, lug to blue, wif to red, and bluf to red as well.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> ""red"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
zup -> ""yellow""

Based on the examples provided, whenever the word ""zup"" appears alone in the input, the output is consistently ""yellow."" Therefore, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

When ""zup"" is followed by another word, the output includes ""yellow"" followed by another color. The word following ""zup"" appears to determine the second color in the output. For instance:

- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red.""
- When ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""

Rule: 
- ""zup"" on its own translates to ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" followed by another word leads to an output where ""yellow"" is followed by a second color determined by the second word.
Rule: bluf -> the color that pairs with the word immediately preceding it in a predefined sequence of word-color pairs.

Explanation:
- The word preceding bluf defines the color that bluf translates to.
- zup bluf results in yellow yellow, hence zup pairs with yellow and bluf takes on that same color when following zup.
- dax bluf zup gives us green green yellow, indicating dax pairs with green and bluf adopts that color when following dax.
- wif bluf yields red red, showing that wif is paired with red and bluf takes that color when following wif.
- The sequence when ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" results in blue appearing after the corresponding color indicated by the word preceding bluf. This suggests lug is also paired with blue, but we do not see bluf directly following lug in the examples to confirm bluf would translate to blue in that case. However, when lug follows bluf, it appears as ""bluf lug"", which gives ""blue blue"", supporting the idea that lug pairs with blue and bluf takes on the color paired with the preceding word.

Therefore, the rule inferred is that bluf translates to the color associated with the word immediately before it, according to the specific word-color pairing rule established within the given context.
To figure out the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns that emerge in the outputs corresponding to the presence of ""walm"" in the inputs:

1. Input: lug walm dax
   - Output: blue blue blue green
   - Pattern: ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for both is ""blue.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   - Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - Pattern: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" with the output as ""green,"" and again ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup"" with the output as ""red.""

3. Input: wif walm dax zup
   - Output: red red red green yellow
   - Pattern: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" with the output as ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   - Output: yellow red red red blue
   - Pattern: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" with the output as ""red.""

5. Input: dax zup dax walm
   - Output: green yellow green green green
   - Pattern: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green.""

From these patterns, it appears the meaning of ""walm"" is context-dependent, changing with the word that precedes it in the input. The rule seems to be:

- ""walm"" takes on the color of the word before it, replicating that color's output an additional two times for a total of three consecutive colors in the output.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:
Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. The word ""walm"" generates three consecutive outputs corresponding to the color of the output associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax
    ",Output: blue blue blue green,blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue."" Here's the evidence from each example:

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue
- ""lug"" is repeated as ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also translates to ""blue.""

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" is repeated as ""green"" again.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" correlates with ""blue"" again (""walm"" is not included in the output, the repeat of ""blue"" may imply ""lug"" means ""blue""), ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is repeated as ""red"" (in the previous input, ""bluf"" meant ""blue,"" but here it pairs with ""red"" which could be due to a possible mistake or another rule not yet identified).

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, we can recognize a consistent pattern where each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Here are the mappings according to the examples:
- ""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue""
- ""wif dax"" -> ""red green""
- ""wif lug dax walm"" -> ""red blue green green green""
- ""lug dax"" -> ""blue green""
- ""dax"" -> ""green""

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif -> Output: red
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue

The output associated with the input ""wif"" is consistently ""red,"" regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input string or other words surrounding it. Hence, it can be deduced that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
Based on the given examples, ""zup"" appears to be associated with the output ""yellow."" Let's analyze the examples provided to see whether this holds consistently:

1. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   (The presence of ""dax"" results in ""green"" and ""zup"" in ""yellow"".)

2. Input: dax zup dax
   Output: green yellow green
   (Both instances of ""dax"" result in ""green"". Sandwiched between them is ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow"".)

3. Input: zup lug zup dax
   Output: yellow blue yellow green
   (The two occurrences of ""zup"" both result in ""yellow"", and they surround ""lug,"" which results in ""blue"". The last word, ""dax,"" results in ""green"".)

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   (""Lug"" results in ""blue,"" ""walm"" also results in ""blue,"" and ""wif"" followed by ""zup"" results in ""red yellow."" Following this, another ""wif"" results in ""red"".)

5. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   (""Lug"" results in ""blue"" and ""zup"" results in ""yellow"".)

From these examples we can determine with confidence that whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This observation confirms the hypothesis that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, we can try to decouple the meaning of ""bluf"" from other words. It seems that each word corresponds to a color and that ""bluf"" might be dependent on a previous word or have a standalone meaning based on some rule. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   
   Here ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word as it repeats ""blue."" However, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also seems to produce ""red.""

2. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

   ""Dax"" produces ""green,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and then ""bluf"" again outputs ""red.""

3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

   ""Lug"" is still ""blue,"" ""wif"" remains ""red,"" and ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

4. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green

   ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" the first ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green,"" ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" and the second ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow."" Then, ""dax"" again results in ""green.""

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   
   ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" is ""red."" Following the pattern, ""bluf"" should again result in ""red,"" and the last ""dax"" is ""green.""

Observing these patterns, ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color outputted by the word just before it. When ""bluf"" follows a word that corresponds to a particular color, the output color of ""bluf"" is the same as that color. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Therefore, the meaning indicated would be:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is ""repeat the color of the previous word.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and outputs given in the examples.

Example 1:
Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green
Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to generate ""green green.""

Example 2:
Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to generate ""yellow yellow.""

Example 3:
Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" again seems to repeat the color preceding it, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue.""

Example 4:
Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" repeats ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats ""red.""

Example 5:
Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
Analysis: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

From the above examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it multiple times. However, the precise number of repetitions can vary. In the first example, ""walm"" repeats the preceding color (""green"") three times, while in the second, it repeats it twice (""yellow yellow""). In subsequent examples, ""walm"" repeats the color twice or thrice depending upon the context.

Rule:
walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word multiple times, typically twice or thrice depending on context.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in each provided example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Analyzing the provided examples, a pattern can be observed in the appearance of the word ""zup"" and the corresponding outputs. The color ""yellow"" appears each time ""zup"" is used in the input. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input corresponds to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning or rule of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
2. Input: wif bluf dax | Output: red red green
3. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup | Output: red blue blue red yellow
4. Input: wif bluf zup | Output: red red yellow
5. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red

By comparing the inputs with the outputs, we can notice the following patterns:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the result is ""green"" repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the result is ""red"" repeated.
- ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it.

Given that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" based on the first and last examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word and duplicates it. There are no examples of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" or ""zup,"" so we can't confirm if the rule applies universally, but within the provided examples, this rule holds.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color corresponding to the preceding word and outputs it twice.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs to uncover any patterns:

- Input: dax lug walm zup wif / Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

- Input: wif walm / Output: red red red

- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug / Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

- Input: zup wif walm lug / Output: yellow red red red blue

- Input: lug walm wif lug / Output: blue blue blue red blue

From these examples, we can see that the word following ""walm"" has its color repeated in the output, therefore we can deduce the following:

walm -> causes the next color to repeat.

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color associated with the subsequent word is repeated in the output pattern one additional time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing the given examples, it's evident that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Based on the samples provided, let's find out what 'lug' means.

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
   Here, 'wif' appears before 'lug' and corresponds to 'red'. Since 'lug' follows it and corresponds to 'blue', 'lug' could mean 'blue'.

2. Input: lug walm wif -> Output: blue blue blue red
   In this case, 'lug' is followed by 'walm', and both correspond to 'blue'. Since 'wif' at the end corresponds to 'red', it supports the idea that 'lug' might mean 'blue'.

3. Input: wif zup lug zup lug -> Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
   Now, 'lug' alternates with 'zup', and 'lug' consistently correlates with 'blue' while 'zup' correlates with 'yellow' and 'wif' with 'red'. This further supports 'lug' as 'blue'.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   In this longer example, 'lug' still corresponds to 'blue', which is consistent with the previous examples. 'wif' at both ends corresponds to 'red', but 'wif' preceding 'lug' does not change the color associated with 'lug'.

5. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
   Just as in previous cases, 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'.

Rule: 'lug' -> 'blue'.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". It does not seem to change meaning depending on position or surrounding words. Thus, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" could be simply stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be determined by the context in which it is used. In each example, the output associated with ""bluf"" is the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   (""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which is red)

2. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   (""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow)

3. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   (""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue)

4. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   (""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow)

5. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   (""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which is yellow)

Rule: bluf -> Takes the color value of the word that precedes it.
Based on the examples provided, the presence of the word ""walm"" seems to output a triplet of a color that corresponds to the word that preceeded ""walm"". For instance:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""green green green"".
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", the output is ""blue blue blue"".

The output is not influenced by the words that follow ""walm"", only by the word that immediately precedes it. The presence of ""walm"" implies that you take the color associated with the preceding word and repeat it three times.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm after a word outputs the color associated with that preceding word, repeated three times.

Hence:

walm -> repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- Here, lug corresponds directly to blue.

Input: dax lug wif lug -> Output: green blue red blue
- In this sequence, lug appears twice and each time it corresponds to blue.

Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- Even though the first two words change, lug remains represented by blue.

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Again, lug corresponds to blue following another color word.

Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif -> Output: blue green green yellow blue red
- In this string of words, lug consistently translates to blue.

So, whenever lug is mentioned, the output is blue, regardless of its position in the string.
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: Regardless of position in the sequence or the other words present, each occurrence of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green."" The context or other words surrounding ""dax"" do not seem to affect this outcome.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color when translated to the output. In all examples, regardless of the context or position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the provided examples.
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color value associated with the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color value of the word that comes before it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""bluf"" translates to green. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" ""bluf"" translates to blue. If the word ""bluf"" follows the word ""zup,"" it takes on a yellow value, but this is inferred with only one example, so it may not be a reliable part of the rule without more data.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in each example and how ""walm"" changes the output. Let's examine the color outputs in relation to the presence of ""walm"" and the words preceding it.

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is preceded by three words, and the output is five colors. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" while ""bluf"" is not directly represented by a color in the output. However, the sequence ""wif walm"" results in three ""red"" at the end, even though ""wif"" by itself is usually only one ""red.""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" and the output is three ""blue.""

3. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" and the output is three ""yellow.""

4. Input: wif walm zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and ""zup,"" it results in a triplicate sequence of the color associated with the preceding word.

5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   Analysis: Again, ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in three ""red,"" but ""lug"" only produces one ""blue"" this time, indicating that ""lug"" might not be directly associated with ""walm."" The last sequence ""wif walm zup"" again shows a triplication effect, but only after ""walm.""

Looking across these examples, it seems that ""walm"" causes the word immediately before it to triple the associated color output. Therefore, we would establish the following rule:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present in the input, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is output three times.

Hence:
walm -> Causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be output in triplicate.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given data, we can see that 'lug' consistently maps to the output 'blue'. We can confirm this by looking at each input-output pair:

Input: wif dax lug -> Output: red green blue
- 'lug' corresponds to the last color 'blue'

Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
- 'lug' is the first word and corresponds to the first color 'blue'

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
- 'lug' is the third word and corresponds to the fourth color 'blue'

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
- 'lug' is the first word and corresponds to the first color 'blue'

Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- 'lug' is the last word and corresponds to the last color 'blue'

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we'll need to look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's analyze them:

Example 1:

- Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
- Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Example 2:

- Input: wif dax
- Output: red green

Example 3:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
- Output: yellow yellow red red red

Example 4:

- Input: lug zup wif
- Output: blue yellow red

Example 5:

- Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
- Output: green green red yellow blue

Looking at the input-output pairs, it seems that each English word corresponds to a particular color. The translations are as follows:

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (not clear if ""walm"" is always ""blue"" or if it can be another color as well)
- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> green (in the first example, ""bluf"" yielded ""red"" in the output, but considering the pattern in other examples, it could be an inconsistency or context-dependent)

Now, let's examine where ""wif"" appears:

- In the first example, after ""wif,"" we get ""bluf"" which results in a ""red"" output, even though ""bluf"" typically means ""green."" This suggests a rule change after ""wif.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""dax,"" and the output is ""red."" Since ""dax"" usually translates to ""green,"" the presence of ""wif"" may be causing the usual output to change to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" and the ""blue"" output typical for ""walm"" changes to ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" directly yields a ""red"" output.
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" again yields a ""red"" output.

Based on these patterns, ""wif"" seems to change the output color to ""red,"" irrespective of the usual color associated with the following word.

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's usual color output to red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in each given instance, regardless of position or surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" might transform into a color that is the same as the color represented by the word preceding it. Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax lug bluf wif
   Output: green blue blue red
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""blue.""

2. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

3. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - This example is the same as the third one, reaffirming the rule inferred above.

5. Input: wif zup bluf
   Output: red yellow yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is also ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in which the word is used and the corresponding outputs.

1. ""lug walm wif bluf"" correlates to ""blue blue blue red red."" We know from this instance that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" has not been clarified, but the pattern implies that ""bluf"" corresponds to the extra ""red"" at the end.

2. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red."" Here, ""wif"" is previously known to correspond to ""red."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to force the preceding color word to repeat three times.

3. ""zup walm dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green."" Like the previous examples, ""zup"" is likely ""yellow"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" with ""walm"" causing the ""yellow"" to repeat three times.

4. ""zup walm wif"" gives us ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Again, ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" which is repeated thrice because of ""walm,"" and ""wif"" gives us ""red.""

5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" ""Walm"" is forcing ""yellow"" to repeat three times, following which the sequence continues normally with the colors corresponding to the given words.

Based on the pattern above, ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be outputted three times. Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color word, it causes that color to be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red green,blue green red red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to identify patterns in the input and the corresponding colors in the output.

Let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
2. Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
3. Input: dax wif walm -> Output: green red red red
4. Input: dax zup lug -> Output: green yellow blue
5. Input: dax zup -> Output: green yellow

From these inputs and outputs, let's observe the placement of ""dax"" and the corresponding color in the output.

- When ""dax"" comes first, it is followed by ""walm,"" ""wif,"" or ""zup."" The first color in the output is always green.
- Even when ""dax"" is not first (Example 2), the color corresponding to ""dax"" is still green.
- ""walm,"" ""wif,"" and ""zup"" do not consistently correspond to the color green (except ""walm"" to green in 1 and 3), so it is ""dax"" that determines the color green.

Therefore, we can deduce that irrespective of its position in the list of nonce words or the presence of other words, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in every given example.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is introduced in the input, ""yellow"" is produced in the output. Even when ""zup"" is presented in different contexts, with different words before or after it, it consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
The rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to depend on the words that precede it. Each word corresponds to a specific color, and when ""bluf"" appears, it repeats the color of the word that comes right before it.

Here's the breakdown of the color association for the given input words:

- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue

Now, let's verify this rule with the examples provided:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Rule check: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

2. Input: dax zup bluf
   Output: green yellow yellow
   Rule check: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

3. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   Rule check: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.

4. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Rule check: ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is red, so ""bluf"" is also red.

5. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
   Rule check: ""bluf"" first follows ""dax"" which is green, so ""bluf"" is also green. Later, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which is yellow, so ""bluf"" is also yellow.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" is:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that comes directly before it.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of a color word. Each unique word preceding ""walm"" translates to a specific color as follows: ""lug"" translates to blue, ""wif"" translates to red, and ""dax"" translates to green.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, the meaning can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. This consistent substitution suggests that ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the given examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" through comparison:

1. Input: wif lug dax lug
   Output: red blue green blue
   
   Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". ""wif"" appears once and outputs ""red"".

2. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red

   ""wif"" results in ""red"" again, and ""bluf"" also outputs ""red"". ""zup"" does not appear in the first example but outputs ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" as before, ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green"" this time (which means ""bluf"" doesn't have a consistent color representation), ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""zup"" again results in ""yellow"".

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
   With no other words present, ""wif"" alone results in ""red"".

5. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to output ""red"" multiple times.

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from the given examples, let's analyze the correlation between the inputs and outputs:

Example 1:
Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

Example 2:
Input: zup
Output: yellow

This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" when it appears on its own because there is a direct correlation between the single instance of ""zup"" and the output ""yellow"".

Example 3:
Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" appears twice after another color word, ""lug"" and ""bluf"", but in both instances, ""zup"" continues to be translated as ""yellow"". This supports our initial hypothesis that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Example 4:
Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Again, ""zup"" follows another color word ""wif"" and is translated to ""yellow"", remaining consistent with our finding.

Example 5:
Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow

In this example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and ""dax"", both of which are color words, leading to ""zup"" being translated as ""yellow"" in both instances. The word ""walm"" at the end does not have an obvious correlation and does not affect the translation of ""zup"".

Based on the above analysis, the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent, and the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to a repetition of the color assigned to the word immediately preceding it.

Here's the deduced rule applied to each example:

- In example 1: ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- In example 2: ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"".
- In example 3: ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"".
- In example 4: ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"".
- In example 5: ""wif bluf"" translates again to ""red red"".

Rule: bluf -> repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the repeated patterns and how the output changes accordingly.

In the given examples:

1. **wif walm dax zup wif lug walm**
   - Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

2. **dax walm**
   - Output: green green green

3. **wif zup bluf lug walm**
   - Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

4. **zup lug walm wif walm**
   - Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

5. **dax zup walm wif**
   - Output: green yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, we can infer a pattern where the output after ""walm"" repeats the previous color three times. Let's break down the first example:

- ""wif walm"" -> Output: ""red red red""
- ""dax"" by itself is ""green,"" but ""dax zup wif"" changes the pattern. However, ""dax walm"" results again in ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""walm"" repeats the immediately preceding color in the output.
- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" -> Output: ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue,"" showing the same repetition of the color before ""walm,"" which is ""blue.""

This consistent repetition in the examples suggests that ""walm"" triggers the repetition of the previous color in the sequence, making it persist for three occurrences.

Rule: walm -> causes the immediately preceding color name in the output to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
From the given examples, we can try to figure out what ""dax"" means by looking at the consistent elements presented in the inputs and outputs.

1. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

2. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: dax
   Output: green

5. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

A rule seems to emerge from these examples:
- Whenever the input contains ""dax"" by itself, the output is always ""green.""
- Furthermore, ""dax"" followed by other nonce words leads to ""green"" followed by other colors associated with each nonce word.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" Each additional nonce word corresponds to a specific color in the output, where ""wif"" corresponds to red repeatably, ""lug"" to blue, ""zup"" to yellow repeatably, and ""walm"" to red repeatably.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

This establishes that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" independently.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

When ""zup"" is paired with ""walm,"" ""walm"" is repeated as ""yellow"" three times, suggesting ""walm"" may mean a repetition of the previous color, in this case, three times.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green

""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" again results in the previous color ""green"" being repeated three times. This reinforces that ""walm"" indicates repetition.

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue

""dax"" translates to ""green,"" repeated because of ""bluf,"" which we might infer means something similar to a repetition (but how many times is not clear from this single occurrence). ""wif"" again is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Note: we don't have enough information to conclude firmly what ""bluf"" means in terms of repetition, but it does seem to induce at least one repetition of the previous color, which is ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue

Here ""dax"" is ""green,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats the green color three times. ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue.""

Rule: zup -> yellow

This consistency across all examples provided indicates that the rule is that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
From the examples provided, we can infer that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the last color word mentioned before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   Rule implication: bluf -> red because the word before it (wif) corresponds to the color red.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Rule implication: bluf -> yellow because the word before it (zup) corresponds to the color yellow.

3. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   Rule implication: bluf -> yellow because the word before it (zup) corresponds to the color yellow.

4. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   Rule implication: bluf -> green because the word before it (dax) corresponds to the color green.

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   Rule implication: bluf -> blue because the word before it (lug) corresponds to the color blue.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" is a placeholder for the color associated with the last color word mentioned immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times. 

Here's the breakdown of each example to illustrate the pattern:

1. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow **yellow yellow**

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green **green green**

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red **red red** yellow blue red **red red** yellow

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green **green green**

5. Input: zup walm wif
   Output: yellow **yellow yellow** red

From these examples, we can deduce:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the examples provided. Every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each nonce word correlates to a specific color:

- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently correlates with ""yellow""

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to examine the common pattern within the examples provided. Here is the breakdown:

1. Every time ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue blue"" is produced.
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""green green"" is produced.
3. When ""bluf"" is at the end or not directly preceded by another word, it seems to refer to ""green.""
4. ""wif"" translates to red, ""lug"" to blue, ""dax"" to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""walm"" seems to imply repetition of the color before it (as seen in example 4 ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"").

Given these observations, ""bluf"" appears to double the color of the word before it when one exists. When it's on its own or last, it defaults to ""green."" Therefore, the rule appears to be as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> duplicates the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding color word or it is the last word, ""bluf"" means ""green.""
Rule: walm -> green green green

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the provided examples, it appears that each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. Furthermore, ""dax"" does not seem to depend on its position or the context of surrounding words to determine its associated output color.

Rule:
dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we need to identify a pattern between the given inputs and their corresponding outputs. We will examine each use of ""wif"" and correlate it with the transformation in color sequence.

1. Input: zup wif zup dax
   Output: yellow red yellow green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" is associated with ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" (since red appears at the end twice after ""wif bluf"") and ""wif"" seems to add an additional ""red.""

3. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green
   ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds here to ""red.""

4. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

5. Input: lug zup wif
   Output: blue yellow red
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" leaving ""wif"" again associated with ""red.""

Based on the examples, whenever ""wif"" is encountered, it translates to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in the given outputs, irrespective of the surrounding context.
bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered, repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

4. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue

5. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue

From the above examples, we can try to determine what ""walm"" contributes to the output by isolating common patterns:

- In examples 1, 3, and 5, after the word ""lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" in the output.
- In example 2, the word ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in three ""green"" in the output.
- Looking at example 4, after ""wif"" and before ""lug,"" ""walm"" is followed by three ""red"" in the output.

From the above observations, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes before it, occurring three times in a row. Thus, if the preceding word corresponds to ""blue,"" ""walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue."" If the preceding word corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green green,"" and so on.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in every given example, irrespective of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" in the context given. The process involves looking for patterns in the input and output sequences to determine what ""dax"" is likely to represent.

Let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif dax wif
   Output: red green red
   
2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   
3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   
4. Input: dax zup lug wif lug
   Output: green yellow blue red blue
   
5. Input: dax
   Output: green

From examples 1 and 3, it's clear that when ""dax"" appears alone or as the second word, the output is ""green."" In the example 4, ""dax"" is the first word and is still ""green."" In example 2, ""dax"" is at the end of a sequence, and it still corresponds to ""green.""

Rule:

In all given examples, ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green,"" regardless of position in the sequence or surrounding words.

Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

dax -> meaning: dax means ""green.""
Analyzing the provided examples, it appears as though each occurrence of ""wif"" is followed by a color in the output. Furthermore, the color that follows ""wif"" is consistent irrespective of the sequence and number of words that precede it. Now, let's break down each example to explore the pattern.

For the first example:
Input: wif walm zup walm
Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and is repeated three times, indicating that ""wif"" denotes a single ""red"" and the repetition applies to the subsequent words.

For the second example:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Again, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"", and ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

For the third example:
Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Here, the presence of ""wif"" after ""zup"" translates to ""red"" again, showing that ""wif"" does not depend on position or preceding words.

For the fourth example:
Input: wif dax lug
Output: red green blue

Once more, ""wif"" results in ""red"" and the other words produce different colors. The position doesn't affect the color associated with ""wif.""

For the fifth example:
Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red

The word ""wif"" comes after different words but still translates to ""red,"" further supporting the concept that ""wif"" signifies ""red"" consistently.

From the above analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the following rule can be induced:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow
Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow"" in each output, regardless of the context or the words that come before or after it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color word that precedes it.

Let's examine the examples:

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which translates to blue, and thus, ""bluf"" translates to blue as well.

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow
""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to red, hence ""bluf"" is also red.

Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
Output: blue green green red green
Here ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" which translates to green, and ""bluf"" once again takes the color of its preceding word, resulting in green.

Input: zup lug bluf
Output: yellow blue blue
""Bluf"" follows ""lug,"" translating to blue. ""Bluf"" takes the same color as the preceding word.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
As with the previous examples, ""bluf"" translates to the color of the preceding word, which is ""wif"" for red.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: If a color word is mentioned before ""walm,"" the output is the color associated with that word repeated as many times as ""walm"" appears. If a non-color word precedes ""walm,"" then the color corresponding to the most recent color word is repeated for each occurrence of ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Here are the corresponding translations lined up:

Input: zup bluf lug zup -> Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
Input: zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue red
Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
Input: dax walm zup lug walm  -> Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue

In every instance, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can infer that each nonce word (such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"") corresponds to a specific color:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (assuming there's a typo in the second input, where ""bluf"" should produce ""yellow"" instead of ""yellow yellow"")
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Therefore, the rule we can induce from these examples is that the nonce word ""dax"" represents the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be consistent across all examples. Every time ""wif"" is used as an input, the output is ""red"". 

Therefore, the rule I can deduce is:

wif -> meaning. The meaning of ""wif"" is ""red"".

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""wif"", the output associated with it is ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" correlated consistently with the output ""yellow."" There is no variation in the output when ""zup"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" unambiguously corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look for patterns before and after each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears. Examine each case of the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""green.""

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   In this case, ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red.""

Looking at the examples, ""bluf"" results in either one or two ""red"" outputs following it, but the exception is when ""bluf"" is the last word or followed by ""wif,"" it results in one instance of the color that corresponds to the word prior to ""bluf."" This exception is also noted in the Input and Output 3, where ""bluf"" followed by nothing results in ""green,"" which is the color associated with ""dax.""

Let's derive the rules:
- When ""bluf"" is at the end or followed by ""wif,"" it repeats the color that corresponds to the preceding word once.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by any other word, it results in ""red red,"" irrespective of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeats the color of the preceding word once if it is the last word or followed by ""wif,"" otherwise outputs ""red red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at each example and analyze the color outputs in relation to the presence of the nonce word ""walm.""

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" -> red red red green yellow
2. ""zup walm lug wif"" -> yellow yellow yellow blue red
3. ""zup walm"" -> yellow yellow yellow
4. ""zup wif walm"" -> yellow red red red
5. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" -> yellow red green green green blue

Analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- Every instance of ""walm"" directly leads to an output with a sequence of ""red.""
- After analyzing example 5, we can notice that ""lug"" after ""walm"" leads to ""blue,"" while in other instances when ""lug"" didn't follow ""walm,"" it did not result in the color ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" always leads to yellow regardless of the presence of ""walm.""
- The first color to appear after ""walm"" is red, and it continues to produce red outputs until the word ""lug"" appears, which changes the output to blue.

Given these observations, the following rule for ""walm"" could be deduced:

Rule: ""walm"" changes the subsequent output colors into a sequence of red until the word ""lug"" is encountered after ""walm,"" which then changes the output to blue.

Therefore, the deduction is:

walm -> changes the output color sequence to red until ""lug"" is encountered, leading to a blue output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
Examining the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the meaning or rule underlying the word ""dax"" according to the input-output patterns:

1. When ""dax walm"" is the input, the output is ""green green green."" The word ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" and the corresponding output is three times ""green.""

2. In the second example, ""dax"" is followed by different words (""bluf,"" ""wif"") and the output is always ""green"" following the occurrence of ""dax.""

3. The third example again shows that ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and ""wif bluf,"" resulting in ""green green green red red,"" with the first instance of ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""

4. When ""dax"" appears by itself with ""bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" Regardless of the word that comes after ""dax,"" the first output is always ""green.""

5. In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif,"" and the output starts with ""green"" followed by a different color for each subsequent word.

From these examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently maps to the output ""green,"" indicating that whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the corresponding output includes ""green"" as the first color following it, irrespective of the words that follow. Additionally, the other words in the inputs (""walm,"" ""bluf,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""lug"") seem to map to their own specific colors in the output as well (some occurrences like ""walm"" always resulting in ""green,"" while others vary).

Given the above observations, the rule induced for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

Rule: dax -> green

This means that every time ""dax"" occurs in the input, the immediate output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" correlates to the output ""red"" in every instance where it appears. Here are the occurrences:

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red""

Input: dax lug wif
Output: green blue red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the last ""red""

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red
- ""wif"" corresponds to the second ""red"" and the second to last ""red""

Input: lug zup wif zup
Output: blue yellow red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again

Input: wif
Output: red
- Alone, ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red""

With this pattern, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. There is a consistent pattern where each occurrence of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the words that come before or after it. The surrounding words each correspond to their unique color translation (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""dax"" -> green, ""bluf"" -> yellow).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to correspond directly to the color that precedes it. Let's look at the pattern:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (lug dax bluf), the output is ""blue green green"", meaning ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, which is ""blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (wif bluf), the result is ""red red"", again ""bluf"" takes the color value of the preceding word, which is ""red.""
- Similarly, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (dax bluf), the outcome is ""green green"", which continues the pattern of ""bluf"" adopting the color of the preceding word, ""green.""
- Following ""zup,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow blue blue"", once again reflecting the color of the word before it, which is ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to decipher what ""walm"" means based on its usage and the corresponding outputs:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

Let's closely observe how the outputs are structured:

- In example 1, ""wif"" seems to correlate with ""red"" and is followed by ""walm"" which produces ""red red"". This might imply that ""walm"" means repeating the previous color.
- In example 2, ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"" which produces ""blue blue"", supporting the previous inference that ""walm"" could stand for repeating the color mentioned before it.
- In example 3 the same logic applies: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"", with ""walm"" repeating the previous color ""yellow"" after ""zup"" and ""lug"" repeating the color ""blue"" at the end.
- Example 4 mixes the colors, but ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the output is three yellows in a row again, implying repetition of the last mentioned color, ""yellow"".
- In the last example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see three yellows again, with the pattern holding true.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" makes the last mentioned color appear three times in a row in the output. Considering that there's always a color word before ""walm"" in the input, we can make the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color mentioned three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each instance, regardless of the context. 

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in each given example, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in the examples given.

- In each instance where ""walm"" is used, the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- ""Walm"" does not appear as an isolated word; it is always preceded by another word.
- The word that precedes ""walm"" does not affect the output created by ""walm,"" as different words precede it, yet the output remains ""blue blue blue.""

We can conclude that ""walm"" corresponds to a triple repetition of the word ""blue."" The other words (lug, zup, dax, and wif) correspond to their respective colors (blue, yellow, green, and red), and they maintain their output regardless of whether they are followed by ""walm.""

Based on the examples provided:

Rule: walm -> ""blue blue blue"" (regardless of the preceding word)

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green blue blue blue,blue red green green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" can be inferred by its consistent association with the same output irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Specifically, whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be any additional context affecting this translation, so the rule seems to be a direct substitution of the word ""dax"" for the color ""green.""
To determine the meaning of ""wif"" from the examples given, let's analyze each instance where it occurs and the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   
2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

5. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

From these examples, we can observe:

- Whenever ""wif"" is mentioned alone or in sequence, the output is ""red"".
- For example 4, ""wif walm"" correlates with ""red red red"", suggesting that ""wif"" retains its meaning of ""red"" even when combined with another word, which itself translates to ""red red"".
- In examples involving multiple words, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Based on these observations, the rule seems straightforward:
wif -> meaning. Meaning is ""red"". Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"". The other words in the examples seem to translate as follows:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- bluf -> yellow (since it translates to the same color as ""zup"" in the 2nd and 5th examples)
- walm -> red (since it is in sequence with ""wif"" in the 4th example, and both translate to ""red"")

The pattern doesn't appear to depend on the position of ""zup"" in the sentence, meaning its translation is consistent regardless of context in these cases.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to a specific color in the output. Across all examples, ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" or ""blue."" However, the color changes from one example to the other. To deduce the rule, we need to look for a pattern in the context in which ""bluf"" appears.

In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup"" and corresponds to the color ""blue"" but when it is followed by ""wif"" it maps to ""yellow."" However, in the other examples, this pattern does not consistently hold. To find a consistent pattern, let's examine the position of ""bluf"" in relation to the other words and their corresponding colors:

1. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue **blue** yellow **yellow** red
2. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow **yellow** red blue green
3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow **yellow** red red red
4. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green **green** red blue yellow
5. Input: wif bluf dax lug
   Output: red **red** green blue

It looks like ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of the word preceding it in the sequence. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (which corresponds to yellow), it is translated as ""yellow."" When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (which corresponds to green) or ""wif"" (which corresponds to red), it becomes ""green"" or ""red"" respectively. The only inconsistency here is with the first input, where ""bluf"" following ""lug"" (which translates to blue) leads to a translation of ""blue"" for ""bluf,"" but it seems like that might be coincidental based on the other samples provided.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> The color of the word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns in the outputs, treated as color sequences, corresponding to the inputs containing the word ""walm."" Let's see if there's any consistency:

1. Looking at the first example:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
- After ""dax,"" we see green once, and after ""walm,"" we have three reds.

2. Checking the second example:
Input: wif lug dax walm
Output: red blue green green green
- ""wif"" results in red, ""lug"" in blue, ""dax"" in green, and after ""walm"" we have two additional greens.

3. Reviewing the third example:
Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- ""wif"" gives us red, ""zup"" results in yellow, and after ""walm,"" we have one extra yellow.

4. Analyzing the fourth example:
Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
- Here it is more difficult to see a simple pattern related to ""walm"" because it follows the sequence ""wif walm lug wif,"" which translates to ""red red red blue red"".

5. Considering the fifth example:
Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" yields yellow, and after ""wif walm,"" we have two more reds.

From these examples, it seems that ""walm"" somehow affects the count or repetition of colors that come after it. However, due to inconsistent or insufficient data around the examples, the exact rule isn't immediately clear. In some cases, it seems to repeat the color that comes after it, while in others, the repetition is not evident.

One possible rule could be that ""walm"" repeats the color output that directly follows it a certain number of times. This theory seems to hold for the first, second, and fifth examples but does not work well for the third, and fourth examples due to the presence of ""dax"" and ""lug"" following ""walm"", disrupting the pattern.

Therefore, with the given data, we cannot come up with a consistent rule for what ""walm"" means. Thus, we may hypothesize that ""walm"" could lead to a repetition of the following color, but there is not enough consistency across all examples to confidently state this as a rule.

Rule: Insufficient data to determine a consistent meaning for ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue green green,yellow green blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates directly to the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each input word is consistently associated with a specific color in the output. Here's the pattern observed:

- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red.""
- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""dax"" also consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Given this pattern, the word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" each time it appears in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
From the provided examples, we can induce the following pattern:

- When wif appears alone, the output is ""red"".
- When wif follows other words, it adds ""red"" at the end of other color(s) mentioned.
- It seems that the words before wif also correspond to specific colors in the output sequence.

Let's try to correlate the inputs to their respective outputs based on the given examples:

- ""zup wif"" produces ""yellow red"". ""zup"" alone is not given, but it can be inferred that ""zup"" might correspond to ""yellow"" and when ""wif"" follows, we add ""red"".

- ""wif"" on its own produces ""red"".

- ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" gives ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". This indicates that ""lug"" produces ""blue"", ""walm"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". Each ""wif"" adds ""red"" at its respective position to the output. This supports the pattern we've witnessed so far.

- ""zup wif lug wif"" translates to ""yellow red blue red"". This confirms that ""zup"" produces ""yellow"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and each ""wif"" adds ""red"".

- ""dax zup walm wif"" leads to ""green yellow yellow yellow red"". This correlates ""dax"" with ""green"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" also with ""yellow"". Again, ""wif"" adds ""red"" to the end of the sequence.

Therefore, the rule for wif seems to be that it corresponds to the color ""red"", and when it is used, it either adds ""red"" to the existing sequence of colors mentioned before it or represents the color ""red"" by itself when it stands alone.

Rule: wif -> red (either appends ""red"" to the color sequence when wif follows other words, or represents ""red"" itself when wif is used alone).
From observing the input-output pairs, we can see that each word in the inputs corresponds to a specific color in the outputs. Specifically, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""blue."" The only inconsistent word across all examples is ""zup,"" which always corresponds to ""yellow.""

So, based on the examples provided, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To understand the meaning of ""bluf,"" examine each instance where the word appears and identify any patterns. Let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and we see ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax lug -> Output: red red green blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" 
   - Since ""wif"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""red"" again, it seems that ""bluf"" could indeed mean ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" this time, breaking the pattern from previously. It does not always mean ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf wif -> Output: yellow yellow red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red.""
   - Here, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is a new color.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow."" 
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the same sequence as ""zup"" appears.
   - The new word ""walm"" at the end yields ""red,"" the same color as ""wif.""


Considering the different outputs for ""bluf"" in these sequences, we can deduce that ""bluf"" does not represent a consistent color on its own. Instead, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to relate to the preceding word. It repeats the color of the word that comes before it.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns regarding the position and the output associated with this word in the given examples.

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see three ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" after ""zup,"" and we see one ""yellow"" and three ""blue"" in the output. This suggests that ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"" and the number of ""blue"" in the output is one more than the number of times ""lug"" appears.

3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" is at the end, and with ""zup"" before it, there are three ""yellow"" in the output at the end. This emphasizes the connection between ""zup"" and the color ""yellow,"" as well as ""walm"" repeating the color that precedes it.

4. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the three ""yellow"" are followed by colors that correspond to the input words that follow ""walm."" Again, each color repetition relates to the previous word's color.

5. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and we see three ""red"" colors before a ""yellow,"" which corresponds with ""zup"" being associated with the color yellow.

From these examples we can deduct the following rule for ""walm"":

- ""walm"" causes the output of the color corresponding to the word that is directly before ""walm"" to be repeated three times in the output. If ""zup"" is before ""walm,"" it will repeat ""yellow"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times in the output. If preceded by ""zup,"" output ""yellow"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be fairly straightforward. It seems that each time the word ""dax"" is presented, the output is ""green."" Regardless of the position of the word ""dax"" within a sequence of words, its associated output remains consistent. No other context is provided that alters the meaning of ""dax"" - it is always linked to the same output. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Let's verify this with each example:

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
- Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: dax zup wif zup -> Output: green yellow red yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif dax zup -> Output: red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule:
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" in the context provided.

In each instance where ""zup"" is used, the output always includes the color ""yellow."" This occurrence is consistent regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""

Now, let's review each example to confirm this:

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow
- Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" must also correspond to ""yellow"" since it appears twice and ""yellow"" is repeated twice after ""zup.""

Input: lug zup
Output: blue yellow
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""Zup"" and ""walm"" again correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" at both positions where it appears. ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue

Explanation:
In each example, whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" This is consistent across all given examples, regardless of the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence or the other words present.
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- 'dax' and 'walm' both produce the output 'green'.

Input: wif zup walm dax zup
Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
- 'wif' translates to 'red'.
- 'zup' translates to 'yellow'.
- The sequence 'walm dax' produces an additional 'green' after 'yellow yellow'.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- 'lug' translates to 'blue'.
- 'bluf' translates to 'red'.
- Again, the sequence 'walm dax' produces an additional 'green' after multiple 'yellow'.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
- Switching the order of 'dax walm' to 'walm dax' seemingly makes no difference, as 'walm' after 'dax' still produces 'green green'. However, 'walm' after 'zup' produces 'yellow yellow'.

Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- 'zup' before 'walm' produces 'yellow'.
- 'walm' between 'zup' and 'dax' seems to produce 'yellow'.
- 'dax' after 'walm' produces 'green', regardless of what precedes 'walm'.

Rule: 
'walm' seems to act as a repeater for the color produced by the word immediately preceding it. If 'dax' precedes 'walm', the color 'green' is repeated. If 'zup' precedes 'walm', the color 'yellow' is repeated. The pattern holds regardless of the position of 'walm' in the sequence or what follows it.

Therefore, the rule for 'walm' can be described as follows:
walm -> Repeat the color output associated with the word directly preceding 'walm'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to induce a rule for the nonce word ""wif.""

1. When ""wif"" appears alone after another word:
   - Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
   - Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
   The word following ""wif"" seems not to matter since ""wif"" always results in the output ""red.""

2. When ""wif"" appears before another word:
   - Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   - The output ""red"" is repeated a number of times corresponding to some property of the following word.

3. When ""wif"" appears within a sequence of other words:
   - Input: zup bluf wif dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow red green blue
   - Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   In both examples, ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words.

By examining these patterns, it appears that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" However, there is a pattern where the word following ""wif"" can affect the output. Specifically, in the example ""wif walm,"" the result is ""red red red,"" indicating that the following word may dictate the repeat count or some characteristic is influencing the number of times ""red"" is output. Unfortunately, we do not have enough examples to definitively determine the rule for when ""wif"" is followed by another word.

Based on the available information, a rule we can induce with some confidence is: 

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present, the output will always include ""red."" If ""wif"" stands alone before another word, it may influence the number of times ""red"" appears in the output, potentially based on a characteristic of the word that follows ""wif."" Unfortunately, due to limited data, a precise rule for this behavior cannot be induced. 

Therefore, a tentative rule based on given information is:
wif -> red (with an unknown modifier affecting repetition when followed by another word)
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"":

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue
- Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif"" and the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue
- ""zup"" appears twice in this sequence, each time followed by ""lug."" Each instance of ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" while ""wif"" remains ""red"" and ""lug"" ""blue.""

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow red,"" with ""zup"" as ""yellow"" and ""wif"" as ""red.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- ""zup"" appears alone and directly translates to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green
- ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""bluf,"" which is another nonce word, but it also corresponds to ""yellow."" In this sequence, ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""dax"" is ""green.""

Rule: zup -> yellow. Zup consistently corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context in which it appears.
Rule: It seems that the word bluf is translated as repeating the color word that precedes it. In the examples given:

- When ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow"".
- When ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green red red"".
- When ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".

However, there is an inconsistency with the second example, where ""dax wif bluf"" leads to ""green red red"" instead of ""green green"". This inconsistency might suggest that the rule is not perfectly clear, or there is additional context we are missing. Based on the provided information, except the inconsistent example, the best rule we can define is:

bluf -> Repeat the color that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the common patterns in the output when ""walm"" is used in the input:

- In all instances, ""walm"" triggers a sequence of the same color in the output.
- The specific color seems to depend on the immediately preceding word, which sets the color.
  
Analyzing the examples:

1. Input: lug dax walm
   Output: blue green green green
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is green following ""dax.""

2. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - The pattern repeats after the initial ""dax,"" directly followed by ""walm,"" yielding additional greens. Then we see ""wif walm"" and the result is red repeating. ""zup"" does not have ""walm"" after it and is followed by yellow just once.

3. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - After ""lug walm,"" we notice a repetition of blue, and no ""walm"" follows ""zup.""

4. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   - ""lug"" comes before ""walm,"" and we see a repetition of blue.

5. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" proceeds ""walm,"" resulting in a repetition of green.

From the above analysis, the rule associated with ""walm"" seems to be that it causes a repetition of the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it. Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the output is multiple ""blue;"" if it's ""dax,"" the output sequence is multiple ""green;"" if it's ""wif,"" the output sequence is multiple ""red."" ""Walm"" retains the color of the word that comes just before it and repeats that color in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word 'lug' is present in the input, the output is 'blue' regardless of its position or the context within the sentence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" We can deduce this by looking at each example where ""dax"" is used and the color ""green"" consistently appears in the output.

Here is the pattern observed:

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
Input: dax lug -> Output: green blue
Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
Input: lug wif dax wif -> Output: blue red green red
Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

In each example, irrespective of the other words present, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to ""red"" regardless of its position within the input sequence:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red  
(Input starts with ""wif"", corresponding output starts with ""red"")

Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red  
(""wif"" is the last word, correspondingly ""red"" is the last color in the output)

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm -> Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow  
(""wif"" follows ""dax"", and ""red"" follows ""green""; No other pattern seems to correlate with ""dax"" and ""green"")

Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow  
(""wif"" precedes ""zup"" and ""red"" precedes ""yellow"")

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red  
(""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and in the output ""red"" precedes another ""red"")

From these examples, it's clear that every time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
By analyzing the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". We'll look at instances where ""zup"" is used to figure out the pattern.

Example 1:
Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

Example 2:
Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Example 3:
Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

Example 4:
Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Example 5:
Input: zup dax lug
Output: yellow green blue

From these examples, it appears that every time the input word ""zup"" is used, the corresponding output is ""yellow"". There is a direct one-to-one mapping between ""zup"" and ""yellow"" across all examples.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can infer the meaning of ""bluf"" by comparing the input sequences to their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The word ""bluf"" appears to mirror the color that precedes it.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the same color.

3. Input: lug bluf wif
   Output: blue blue red
   Analysis: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the same color before the sequence changes with ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. Input: wif bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: red red yellow yellow red
   Analysis: ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color that came before it.

5. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue
   Analysis: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and again, ""bluf"" repeats the color that immediately precedes it (""red"").

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Bluf -> meaning: bluf means to repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" translates to ""yellow."" Each time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow.""

Rule: walm -> yellow

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue in the output across all provided examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we must look for patterns in the provided examples. 

Let's examine the word ""dax"" in relation to the colors provided:

1. In all instances where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding color is ""green.""
2. ""dax"" does not depend on its position in the sequence to correspond to the color ""green."" It is ""green"" whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence.
3. No other word appears to constantly correspond to the color ""green"" in the inputs provided.

Given these observations, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: dax -> green

The meaning of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" whenever it appears in the input.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples given, every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. The other words correspond to different colors, but ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red."" Hence, the word ""wif"" means ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems clear that each input word corresponds to a color in the output. By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we can deduce:

- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green

Given that, and the fact that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output regardless of its position or the words around it, we can induce that ""zup"" directly translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color blue when it follows the word ""lug,"" to green when it follows the word ""dax,"" and to yellow when it follows the word ""zup."" However, ""bluf"" translates to red when it follows the word ""wif."" Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" is contingent on the preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" means blue after ""lug,"" green after ""dax,"" yellow after ""zup,"" and red after ""wif.""
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the given examples and outputs:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- Here, ""walm"" corresponds to three repetitions of the color ""green.""

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Walm"" occurs twice, once after ""lug"" resulting in three ""blue,"" and once after ""zup"" resulting in three ""yellow.""

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""Walm"" after ""dax"" leads to three ""green."" After ""wif,"" it leads to three ""red,"" and ""zup"" is present at the end without ""walm"" following it, and no additional color is given for it.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- ""Walm"" occurs after ""wif,"" leading to three ""red,"" and it follows ""lug,"" leading to three ""blue."" Other colors appear without ""walm"" following the preceding words.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- Again, ""walm"" following ""wif"" corresponds to three ""red.""

Based on this analysis, ""walm"" seems to be a rule that takes the color associated with the preceding word and repeats it three times. The rule depends on the color word that comes before ""walm"":

- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Therefore:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue,yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word appears to correspond to a color. For the word ""dax,"" it consistently translates to the color ""green."" The other words in the examples appear to correspond to different colors as well. Here is what we can deduce:

- dax -> green
- bluf -> green (notably the same as dax, which might either be a coincidence or a feature of the rule set we haven't been provided enough data to distinguish)
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> blue (the same as lug)

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by comparing the input and output strings. It should be noted that every instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" is also translated to ""red.""
- In the third example, the placement of ""wif"" results in ""red"" once again.
- The fourth example has ""wif walm dax"" input, with ""red red red green"" as the output, wherein ""wif"" is the first word and is translated as ""red.""
- In the fifth example, similarly, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Considering this consistent pattern across all examples, we can deduce the rule:

wif -> red.
zup -> rule. Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'. Each subsequent word in the input after 'zup' maintains the color that 'zup' translates to until a new color word is encountered.

For instance, in the first input example ""wif dax zup walm,"" the word 'wif' is translated to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', and once 'zup' is encountered, it translates to 'yellow' and 'walm' does not modify it, so the subsequent outputs remain 'yellow'. If a word representing a new color (like 'wif' for red or 'lug' for blue) is encountered after 'zup', the output color changes accordingly.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can examine the patterns in the examples given:

1. When ""lug"" is followed by ""wif walm"":
   - ""lug"" results in ""blue"" 
   - ""wif"" results in ""red"" 
   - ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the previous word, hence three ""red"".

2. When ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif"":
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" here repeats the color ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" then returns to ""red"".

3. When ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" only:
   - ""dax"" results in ""green""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" twice more.

4. When ""dax"" is followed by ""wif zup bluf wif walm"":
   - The colors follow the sequence ""green red yellow yellow red""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif,"" which is ""red"".

5. When ""zup"" is followed by ""walm"":
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
   - ""walm"" repeats the color ""yellow"" twice more.

Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" can be deduced to mean the repetition of the color associated with the previous word. In other words, ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it and repeats it as many times as ""walm"" is mentioned.

Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be: lug means ""blue.""

Rule: lug = ""blue""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Here's the rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can observe that every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" is present in the output. ""Wif"" does not seem to change in meaning based on context within these examples, as it consistently maps to ""red"" regardless of its position in the list or the presence of other words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is outputted in the corresponding position. With this information, I can deduce the rule for what ""zup"" means:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples provided and their corresponding outputs, I notice a pattern:

1. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

2. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red

3. Input: wif walm lug bluf
   Output: red red red blue blue

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

In each example, the output colors correspond to the words in the input immediately before ""bluf"". Specifically, ""bluf"" seems to cause a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. We can infer the following rule:

- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- ""lug,"" ""walm,"" ""bluf,"" and other input words that are not explicitly matched also seem to have color mappings, but the given examples are not enough to ascertain their exact colors.

When we look closer, ""bluf"" seems to double the output color of the word that precedes it. For example, ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow,"" and ""dax wif bluf"" results in ""green red red.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" based on the input-output correspondences seems to be:

bluf -> Repeats the color output of the word that comes before it.

So, if ""wif"" is ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" would be ""red red."" If ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" would be ""yellow yellow."" And so on.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at each example and correlate the presence of ""walm"" with the output:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
   ""zup"" is followed by three ""yellow,"" suggesting that ""zup"" stands for ""yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" we still get ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" could be a repetition modifier for the previous word.

2. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   
   ""wif"" correlates with ""red,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" After ""wif walm,"" we have three ""red,"" and after ""lug walm,"" we have three ""blue."" Here, ""walm"" again serves as a repetition modifier.

3. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   
   ""lug"" is followed by ""blue,"" but when followed by ""walm,"" we again see repetition. The pattern remains consistent.

4. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in two additional ""green"" before the pattern changes with ""lug"" leading to ""blue.""

5. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   
   ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""red"" being repeated.

From these observations, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" is a rule that commands repetition of the previous color mentioned three times in total. If the previous input term corresponds to a color, ""walm"" makes the output that color thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the previous color a total of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug"" appears alone, the output is ""blue.""
- When ""lug"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""blue"" with the preceding word translated as ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""zup,"" it still translates to ""blue"" but does not affect the translation of ""zup"" to ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the word ""bluf"" is also translated into ""blue,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" translates to the same color or that the word ""lug"" does not affect the translation of ""bluf.""
- The presence of ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and this translation is independent of the position of ""lug.""

Rule: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Other words such as ""zup"" and ""dax"" have their own translations (""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively) that are also position-independent.
Rule: dax -> green
Given the examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Additionally, it does not seem to matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence; it consistently translates to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples show a consistent pattern where every time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is present in the output. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Hence, 

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule of ""bluf,"" we need to examine each example and the corresponding output carefully. Let's analyze them:

- In the first and third examples, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow."" Since both ""dax"" and ""bluf"" are included in the input and the colors ""green"" and yellow appear in the output, it's possible that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""bluf"" either corresponds to ""yellow,"" or there is a repeating pattern involved.

- However, the second example, ""lug bluf,"" results in ""blue blue."" ""lug"" is common in both cases and maps to ""blue."" If ""bluf"" mapped directly to ""yellow,"" we would not see ""blue blue"" as the output of ""lug bluf.""

- The fourth example, ""dax bluf,"" produces ""green green."" This shows that without ""zup"" in between ""dax"" and ""bluf,"" the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax,"" which is ""green."" 

- The final example, ""lug walm wif bluf,"" gives ""blue blue blue red red."" It shows that ""lug"" still corresponds to ""blue,"" but ""bluf"" results in multiple colors not directly linked to ""blue."" This also confirms that ""bluf"" does not directly correspond to ""yellow,"" as the color ""yellow"" does not appear at all in this output.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""bluf"" changes its meaning based on the context of the other words. Specifically, ""bluf"" appears to indicate a repetition of the color of the word that comes immediately before it unless that word is ""zup,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."" 

Therefore, the rule might be:
Bluf -> Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" unless ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then it is ""yellow.""

Alternatively, since there's a consistent correspondence between ""lug"" and ""blue"" and ""dax"" and ""green,"" it could mean:
- ""bluf"" following ""lug"" or ""dax"" without another word in between causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word.
- ""bluf"" following ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" at the end of a sequence with no clear pattern might introduce new colors (as with ""lug walm wif bluf"" resulting in ""blue blue blue red red"").

Rule: Bluf -> (Following ""lug"" or ""dax"" without other words between) Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word. (Following ""zup"") Yellow. Otherwise, it appears to introduce a pattern or colors not explained by other words in the input.
Observing the examples given, we can deduce the meaning of ""walm"" by analyzing its position and the output.

1. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
2. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" -> ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""
3. ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red""
4. ""dax lug walm"" -> ""green blue blue blue""
5. ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""

By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can notice the following patterns:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm"", it results in three ""green"" in the output.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm"", it results in three ""yellow"" before any occurrence of ""walm"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""walm"", it results in three ""red"" before any occurrence of ""walm"".
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm"", it results in three ""blue"" before any occurrence of ""walm"".

Based on this, we can formulate the rule that the word ""walm"" causes a repetition of three colors in the output. The color that is repeated is determined by the word that precedes ""walm"". In the absence of any preceding word with a specified color outcome (like ""dax""), it's possible that ""walm"" defaults to ""green"". However, we don't have an example without ""dax"" leading to green alone, so that is an assumption based on the given data.

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" results in the repetition of three of the same color in the output. The color repeated is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. 

Rule: lug translates to the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of its position in the sequence. Thus:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples, we can try to deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the patterns in the input as they correlate to the output. Let's analyze each example to try to find a rule:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow

5. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue

From the examples, we notice that when ""bluf"" appears in the input, its corresponding output is always ""blue."" It does not seem to be affected by the position in the sequence or by the words surrounding it. Thus, we can infer the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> blue

This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to represent a sequence of colors that are a repetition of the previously mentioned color in the sequence. To determine the exact rule, let's analyze each example:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
2. Input: wif walm | Output: red red red
3. Input: lug walm wif lug | Output: blue blue blue red blue
4. Input: wif walm zup walm | Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
5. Input: zup lug walm wif walm | Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red

From these examples, we can see:

- In the first example, ""lug"" translates to blue, followed by ""zup,"" which translates to yellow. After ""walm,"" three yellows appear, which matches the color mentioned before ""walm"" (yellow).
- In the second example, ""wif"" translates to red, followed by ""walm,"" which generates two additional reds, matching the color mentioned before ""walm"" (red).
- In the third example, ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" which results in two additional blues, again matching the color mentioned before ""walm"" (blue).
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" translates to red, followed by ""walm,"" producing two additional reds. Then ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""walm"" again, this time producing two additional yellows.
- The fifth example follows the same pattern as the others, with ""walm"" causing a repeat of the immediately preceding color.

Therefore, the rule is:

Walm -> Repeats the previous color three times in the output.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a color, it causes the color to be repeated three more times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently correlates with the color ""blue"". Here are the mappings from the inputs to outputs that help deduce the meaning:

- In the first example, ""dax lug bluf wif"" maps to ""green blue blue red"". Since ""dax"" is the only other word that repeats and it maps to ""green"", we can infer that ""lug"" means ""blue"".

- In the second example, ""lug zup dax lug dax"" maps to ""blue yellow green blue green"". Since ""dax"" appears twice and correlates to ""green"" and ""zup"" appears once correlating to ""yellow"", ""lug"" consistently maps to ""blue"".

- In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" maps to ""green blue blue blue"". Given that ""dax"" is already associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" is followed by three ""blue"" outputs, it is unclear what ""walm"" may mean in isolation; however, the output corresponding to ""lug"" remains ""blue"".

- In the fourth example, ""lug wif bluf"" maps to ""blue red red"". Since the output ""red"" appears twice and corresponds to the two words ""wif"" and ""bluf"" that do not repeat in our examples, we focus on ""lug"" which again correlates with ""blue"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" maps to ""green green green red blue green green green"". The reappearance of ""dax"" correlates with ""green"". Although ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes ""wif"" making its meaning somewhat ambiguous, ""lug"" still correlates with the color ""blue"" where it appears.

Therefore, the inferred meaning of the nonce word ""lug"" across the examples is consistently associated with the color ""blue"", leading to the rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the given examples, the output for each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" is consistently ""red."" Thus, we can deduce that ""wif"" is translated to or represented by the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of ""zup"" corresponds directly to the word ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" appears to result in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For instance, in the first input ""dax bluf,"" the output is ""green green."" In this case, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and ""bluf"" causes this color to be repeated once.

To make this rule clearer:
- In the second input, ""zup bluf wif bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The output is ""yellow yellow red red,"" which follows the pattern of repeating the color associated with the word before ""bluf.""
- In the third input, ""wif bluf,"" we similarly get ""red red"" — repeating the color associated with ""wif.""
- The fourth input, ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf,"" gives us a sequence where ""lug"" is presumably blue (judging by its placement between ""zup"" and ""zup""), and at the end, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" resulting in ""yellow yellow,"" which again is a repetition of the color tied to the word before ""bluf.""
- In the fifth input, ""zup wif bluf zup lug,"" we have ""yellow red red,"" where ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red,"" again indicating repetition due to ""bluf.""

Hence, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word.
Observing the examples provided, the output appears to be a sequence of colors, specifically: red, green, blue, and yellow. The word ""walm"" seems to influence the color that is produced in the output. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output to deduce the rule for ""walm"":

1. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""wif"" to red. After ""wif,"" all following color outputs are red until ""lug"" which corresponds to blue.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green, and since it precedes ""walm,"" all output colors are green.

3. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm,"" we see blue repeated until ""wif,"" which changes the color to red.

4. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" follows the double occurrence of ""dax"" and leads to repeated greens.

5. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""dax"" to green, and ""zup"" to yellow. ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is repeated yellows.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" in the input.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated in the output until a new color word appears in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow yellow,yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the examples given, dax seems to correspond to the color green every time it appears. To validate this, I will analyze the patterns within each provided input-output pair:

1. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug 
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
   - Wherever ""dax"" appears, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

2. Input: wif zup wif dax 
   Output: red yellow red green
   - Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

3. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif 
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   - ""Dax"" appears twice and both times it is translated to ""green.""

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - The appearance of ""dax"" results in ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - Once more, ""dax"" aligns with ""green.""

Deduction: Based on the consistency across all examples where ""dax"" always equates to ""green,"" the rule is straightforward.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning: red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs given.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" There are no examples indicating that the meaning of ""zup"" changes with context. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> yellow
To figure out what ""walm"" means in this context, let's parse the examples provided for any consistent patterns related to the word ""walm."" Looking at the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: Before and after ""walm,"" the color yellow is repeated three times. ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" to red.

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""Dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the color green is repeated three times. ""Zup"" follows ""walm"" and the color yellow is also repeated three times.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Analysis: ""Wif"" follows ""zup"" and the color red is repeated three times. ""Walm"" seems to invoke a repetition of the preceding color.

4. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Analysis: ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and the color green is repeated three times, indicating again a repetition of the preceding color.

5. Input: lug walm dax
   Output: blue blue blue green
   Analysis: ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated three times. ""Dax"" follows with the color green not repeated, suggesting ""walm"" does not affect the following word.

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax
    ",Output: green red yellow green green,green red yellow green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
dax -> green

Rule: The word 'dax' consistently corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that:

- For ""wif bluf zup bluf wif"", the output is ""red red yellow yellow red"". Here, 'wif' corresponds to 'red' and 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue', but since 'zup' is followed by 'bluf' which is represented as 'blue', 'zup' in this context represents 'yellow'.
- For ""lug zup"", the output is ""blue yellow"". Here, 'lug' is represented by 'blue', and 'zup' follows 'lug', resulting in 'yellow'.
- For ""dax zup lug bluf"", the output is ""green yellow blue blue"". 'dax' corresponds to 'green', 'lug' to 'blue', and 'bluf' also to 'blue'. 'zup' comes after 'dax' and before 'lug', translating to 'yellow'.
- For ""zup wif walm"", the output is ""yellow red red red"". 'wif' corresponds to 'red'. Since there is no color word before 'zup', but after 'zup', 'wif' which is 'red' comes, 'zup' takes the color 'yellow'.
- For ""wif zup bluf lug"", the output is ""red yellow yellow blue"". The word 'wif' maps to 'red', and 'lug' to 'blue', 'bluf' also yields 'blue'. The 'zup' here is after 'wif' and before 'bluf', giving 'yellow'.

Given these observations, it seems that 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow', regardless of the context.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" one must look at the relationship between the input and output across multiple examples:

1. `dax bluf` -> `green green`
2. `wif bluf lug` -> `red red blue`
3. `wif walm lug bluf` -> `red red red blue blue`
4. `zup dax bluf zup dax` -> `yellow green green yellow green`
5. `wif bluf` -> `red red`

Looking at the patterns, the output always contains repeated colors. Each nonce word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Yet, the word ""bluf"" does not always correspond to the same color; its output color seems to depend on the color the word immediately prior to ""bluf"" represents:

- In example 1, ""dax"" leads to the color ""green"" and ""bluf"" also results in ""green"".
- In example 2, ""wif"" leads to the color ""red"" and ""bluf"" again results in ""red"".
- In example 3, ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"", where ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" and so does ""bluf"".
- In example 4, we see ""dax bluf"" repeated, and consistent with example 1, ""dax"" and ""bluf"" both correspond to ""green"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as does ""bluf"".

Given these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the noun immediately preceding it.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider how it is used in each input and compare it to the output:

1. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue
   
2. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   
3. Input: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   
5. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

From the above examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" is associated with a repetition of red, except in the presence of other words like ""zup,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug,"" which correspond to their own colors (yellow, green, and blue, respectively). The first example particularly illustrates repetition of green before the pattern is broken by blue associated with ""lug.""

Hence, the word ""walm"" is likely to be a command that repeats the color of the previous word in the sequence. This rule would apply in all given examples, accounting for the output. Here is how the rule works:

- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red.
- In ""lug wif walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red.
- In the first example ""zup wif dax walm lug,"" ""zup"" is yellow, ""wif"" is red, ""dax"" is green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green until the sequence hits ""lug,"" which is blue.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated until another color word appears or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the context it appears in and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""wif dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue."" Since ""lug"" is the common word in all examples that produce ""blue,"" we can tentatively associate ""lug"" with ""blue."" The presence of ""wif"" then is associated with ""red.""

- In the second example, ""dax lug"" translates to ""green blue."" We've already associated ""lug"" with ""blue,"" so it's likely that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

- The third example, ""wif walm dax zup,"" translates to ""red red red green yellow."" Here, we've assumed ""wif"" means ""red,"" which fits with the repetition at the beginning. The word ""walm"" does not appear in any other examples, but given that its output is ""red red red,"" it could be either a repetition indicator or mean ""red"" itself. However, without further examples, we can't be sure of its exact meaning. ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" once again corresponds to ""green.""

- The fourth example, ""lug zup dax zup,"" translates to ""blue yellow green yellow."" We can confirm that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

- In the fifth example, ""wif dax wif bluf zup wif,"" translates to ""red green red red yellow red."" Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" The presence of ""bluf"" here is associated with ""red"" and given the repetition of ""wif"" and their consistent translation to ""red,"" it is possible that ""bluf"" is either another indication of ""red"" or a repetition indicator like ""walm."" However, without additional examples, we cannot determine the exact function of ""bluf."" ""Zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""

Based on these analyses, the nonce word ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green."" Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears as the first color in the output sequence. All subsequents word that have a color output seem to follow different rules or context that's not provided in the examples. Therefore, based only on the information available, the rule is that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> yellow.
walm -> meaning. From the examples provided, each time the word 'walm' is used, the output is a repetition of three colors corresponding to the color associated with the word just before 'walm'. The rule seems to be that 'walm' causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

Rule: When 'walm' follows another word that is associated with a color, that color is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in each example provided.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"", we need to look at each example and identify a pattern that helps us deduce its meaning. 

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue red red red
   - The word ""zup"" matches ""yellow"", ""lug"" matches ""blue"", and ""walm"" matches ""blue"" followed by two repetitions of ""red"".

3. Input: wif
   Output: red

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   - The word ""zup"" matches ""yellow"" after ""wif"".

5. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - The word ""dax"" matches ""green"" followed by ""wif"".

From the examples, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". So the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
The meaning of ""zup"" appears to be directly translated to the color ""yellow"" in each example. Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words in the input correlate with other specific colors in the output, but ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""bluf"" changes in relation to the preceding word. The rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color that corresponds to the word right before it. So, if the word before ""bluf"" signifies a particular color, ""bluf"" assumes the same color in the output. 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the same color as the word before it in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm"", let's look at each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
4. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Looking at examples 1 and 2, ""zup walm"" consistently results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", which suggests that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"" and that ""walm"" repeats the color word associated with the first word three times.

In example 3, ""dax lug walm"" gives us ""green blue blue blue"". Here ""dax"" is associated with the color ""green"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"". ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that comes before it three times, as we see ""blue"" repeated three times following ""lug"".

In example 4, ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue"". ""walm"" here again repeats ""yellow"" three times after ""zup"". ""lug"" once again corresponds to ""blue"".

Example 5 is ""dax walm"", and the output is ""green green green"", strengthening the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color tied to the word that precedes it three times.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. 

Thus:

walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following patterns:

- ""lug"" is always followed by the color ""blue"".
- The appearance of ""lug"" does not seem to alter the interpretation of the words before or after it.

According to these observations, we can infer that ""lug"" maps to the word ""blue"". Thus, the rule we can extract from the examples is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" reliably corresponds to ""green"" in the output irrespective of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" correlates directly to the color ""yellow"" each time it is mentioned. The rule seems consistent regardless of context or position in the sequence of words. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" from the examples provided, one must look for a pattern in the corresponding outputs. Let's analyze each given example.

Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
Output: blue red green green red blue

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red

Input: zup lug bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue red

Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Considering the outputs in relation to the inputs, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"". However, it's not a simple one-to-one mapping like the other words seem to have (e.g., ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green""). 

In each instance, the word ""bluf"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output sequence. Additionally, it seems that ""bluf"" causes a duplication of the color that comes after it except when it is the last color like in the first example. Whether this is a direct duplication, or it indicates a pattern that requires the color to be shown twice is something we can ascertain by examining the examples carefully. 

For example, in the first input, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", which corresponds to ""green"", and in the output, we see ""green"" followed by ""red"", not a direct duplication but ""red"" is still repeated afterwards. In the second, third, and fourth examples, ""bluf"" directly precedes ""wif"" or nothing, which correspond to ""red"" in the output. Indeed, in these cases, ""red"" is repeated sequentially.

Therefore, from the given examples, since ""bluf"" always seems to be related to the color ""red"" and most cases involve a repeat of that color, the best deduced rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Causes the next color to be ""red"" and repeated. If ""bluf"" is at the end, it results in a single ""red"".

However, the first example does not strictly confirm to this rule, and it remains unclear why we have a single instance of ""red"" in that particular case. More examples or clarification of the context might be needed to refine the rule further.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns in each input and the corresponding output sequence.

First, it's necessary to observe which part of the output changes with the presence of ""walm"" and which parts don't.

1. Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
   - Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

2. Input: dax lug wif walm -> Output: green blue red red red
   - Removing ""walm,"" the sequence would be ""green blue red,"" corresponding to ""dax lug wif.""
   - The addition of ""walm"" adds two ""red"" instead of one.

3. Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
   - Without ""walm,"" we would expect ""wif dax zup"" to translate to ""red green yellow.""
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" introduces an extra ""red.""

4. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - The expected sequence without the two instances of ""walm"" would be ""red yellow blue yellow.""
   - Each ""walm"" after ""wif"" introduces extra ""red,"" followed by a repetition of the next color in the sequence.

5. Input: dax zup walm wif -> Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - Without ""walm,"" ""dax zup wif"" might give ""green yellow red.""
   - ""walm"" introduces two extra ""yellow"" before the ""red.""

Based on the patterns observed, it seems ""walm"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that follows it two extra times. If ""walm"" is the last word, it repeats the color corresponding to the last actual color word in the sequence two extra times.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears before a color word, the color output corresponding to that word is repeated two additional times. If ""walm"" is at the end or before a non-color word, it repeats the last color in the sequence two extra times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
From the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the word ""dax"":

1. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - Here, the appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". It appears after a sequence of ""yellow"" and before another ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax bluf wif zup
   Output: green green red yellow
   - ""Dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""green"", and is followed by a ""green"" which corresponds to ""bluf"".

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - ""Dax"" appears at the beginning and corresponds to ""green"", and is followed by a ""red"", which corresponds to ""wif"".

4. Input: lug dax lug
   Output: blue green blue
   - ""Dax"" appears between two ""blues"", which correspond to ""lug"", and it corresponds to ""green"".

5. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - ""Dax"" appears at the end and corresponds to ""green"" after a sequence of various colors.

The consistent rule from all examples is that:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"".
Examining the given input and output pairs, we can make an attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by identifying patterns and consistencies in the output that correlate with the presence of ""wif"" in the input.

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm  
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue  
- ""wif"" appears twice and is followed by ""red"" each time.

Input: wif lug  
Output: red blue  
- ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"".

Input: zup wif  
Output: yellow red  
- ""wif"" follows ""zup"" and the corresponding output is ""red"".

Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf  
Output: blue red red green blue blue  
- ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and the output is ""red"".

Input: wif lug  
Output: red blue  
- ""wif"" appears once and is followed by ""red"".

Based on the data provided, the word ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the words that come before or after it. Hence our rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds directly to the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the position in the sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be as follows:

zup -> meaning.

Meaning: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: When ""zup"" is present in the input, the output will always include ""yellow"" corresponding to the position of ""zup.""
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be consistent. Every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, it is translated into ""yellow."" There are no instances in the examples that suggest any variation in the meaning of ""bluf"" based on context or its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's first analyze the patterns in the given inputs and outputs:

1. zup wif lug zup walm
   - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - Here, ""walm"" follows a repetition of ""yellow.""

2. dax lug wif walm
   - Output: green blue red red red
   - In this sequence, ""walm"" follows a repetition of ""red.""

3. dax walm wif zup
   - Output: green green green red yellow
   - After ""dax,"" ""walm"" repeats the color ""green"" that is associated with ""dax.""

4. lug walm zup wif
   - Output: blue blue blue yellow red
   - After ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" associated with ""lug.""

5. dax walm zup
   - Output: green green green yellow
   - ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and repeats the color ""green"" again.

The word ""walm"" seems to be correlated with repetition. Examining the inputs and outputs, it appears that ""walm"" causes the immediate preceding color word to be repeated multiple times.

Rule:  
walm -> Repeat the color of the immediate preceding word multiple times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: ""lug"" means to repeat the following color word once. If ""lug"" appears before a color word such as ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" or ""dax,"" it causes the color word to be repeated once in the output. If ""lug"" appears by itself, it translates to ""blue.""

Examples:
- ""lug bluf"" results in ""blue blue""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" (assuming ""walm"" means ""blue blue"")
- ""lug"" by itself results in ""blue""
- ""wif bluf lug"" results in ""red red blue"" (assuming ""wif"" means ""red"" and ""bluf"" means ""green,"" but since ""lug"" follows ""bluf"" it means ""blue"" instead)
- ""lug"" by itself consistently results in ""blue""
dax -> green. 

Rule: The word 'dax' corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples given:

- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence, ""red"" is output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
- ""dax,"" when present without ""wif,"" leads to the output ""green.""
- ""zup,"" when present without ""wif,"" leads to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" is not seen without ""wif,"" but ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red,"" suggesting that ""walm"" may also correspond to ""red"" or that the repetition of ""red"" signals the repetition of ""wif"" (a word, in this case ""wif,"" being repeated thrice).

Given this information, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> repeat previous color. 

Explanation: 
- In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" with bluf repeating the color associated with ""zup.""
- In the second example, ""zup bluf wif bluf"" becomes ""yellow yellow red red,"" again bluf repeats the color previously mentioned before it.
- The third example, ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug,"" translates to ""blue blue red blue red red red blue,"" where bluf follows ""lug"" and repeats the respective color, which is blue.
- The fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" becomes ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" with bluf repeating the color of the word just before it, ""lug,"" which is blue.
- Lastly, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green,"" where bluf repeats the color associated with ""dax."" 

In all examples, bluf acts as a placeholder to repeat the color mentioned just before it.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to be an instruction to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it three additional times. Let's examine the evidence:

Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
- ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of blue three times.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of yellow three times.

Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""wif"" translates to red, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of red three times, ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, then ""zup"" again to yellow followed by ""walm"" leading to the repetition of yellow three times.

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red
- ""lug"" translates to blue, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of blue three times, ""wif"" translates to red, and ""bluf"" is likely a new concept not defined by previous patterns, but the output suggests that it relates to repeating red once (or it could simply mean red).

Input: zup walm lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
- ""zup"" translates to yellow, followed by ""walm"" which results in the repetition of yellow three times, ending with ""lug"" for blue.

Rule: walm -> When following a word, it causes the output color of that word to be repeated three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
The nonce word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green"" in all given examples. The examples also show that some other words result in their own consistent colors; ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that each unique word is mapped to a specific color. There are no indications that the context or position of the word ""dax"" alters its output. Thus:

Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

1. ""zup wif"" always outputs ""yellow red"".
2. The term ""wif"" when used alone outputs ""red"".
3. In the sequence ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup"", the outputs are ""yellow yellow red green red yellow"", where the term ""wif"" is surrounded by different words but still outputs ""red"" when it appears.
4. When ""wif"" is used with ""lug"", it outputs ""red blue"".

Given these observations, the most consistent rule for the meaning of ""wif"" irrespective of context is that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". There is no evidence from the examples provided that ""wif"" means anything other than ""red"", as it consistently produces the output ""red"" in different contexts.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word translates into a color:

- ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue""
- ""dax"" translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" also translates to ""green"" (in the second example, it follows ""dax,"" which we have deduced means green)
- ""bluf"" seems to be a variation on ""blue,"" as it also translates to ""green"" in the third example

In all examples, the word ""zup"" is followed by the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the words that precede it. This suggests that ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding bluf.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is encountered, repeat the color output that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"". For example, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", then ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to be repeated, resulting in ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to identify patterns in the input-output pairs provided.

Considering each example:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
2. Input: zup dax lug walm zup -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow
3. Input: zup walm dax lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
5. Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue

By examining these examples, we can try to establish a correlation:

- When ""dax"" is present, ""green"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is present, ""blue"" is in the output.
- When ""zup"" is present, ""yellow"" is in the output.
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" we see a ""red red"" pattern.

Now focusing on ""walm,"" let's see what happens in each case:

1. ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and we see an additional ""green"" in the output.
2. ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and we see two more ""blue"" in the output.
3. ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and we see two more ""yellow"" in the output.
4. ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and again we see an additional ""green"" in the output.
5. ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and we observe two more ""blue"" in the output, similar to example 2.

What seems to be consistent is that the presence of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word just before it. It increases the number of times that color appears in the output by two. Given these observations, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to replicate the color associated with the previous word two additional times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug walm dax
    ",Output: red blue blue blue green,red blue blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color green in English.
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the input-output pairs and see where ""wif"" appears and what comes after it in the output.

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup -> Output: red blue blue red yellow
4. Input: lug wif walm -> Output: blue red red red
5. Input: zup lug bluf wif -> Output: yellow blue blue red

Observations:

- When ""wif"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""red,"" as seen in example 1 and 3.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"" or ""lug,"" the output is ""red,"" followed by the colors associated with those words (""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""blue"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""), as in examples 3 and 4.
- When ""wif"" is the first word, it translates to ""red,"" as in examples 2 and 3.
- When ""wif"" is the last word, it translates to ""red,"" as in example 5.

In every instance, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. There are no counterexamples. Thus, based on these observations, we can define the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" refers to the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, ""bluf"" seems to consistently represent the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""blue"" in the output. However, there is an incongruity in the first example where ""bluf"" is followed by ""red red."" This may suggest that ""bluf"" not only represents ""blue"" but may also imply duplication of the following color, although the same pattern doesn't occur in other examples. The other examples do not have any color following ""bluf,"" which might suggest why this duplication doesn't appear elsewhere. Thus, the ""red red"" duplication after ""bluf"" in the first example remains unexplained with the given data, requiring us to dismiss it for now or consider that there may be further rules not apparent from the examples provided.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""blue""
walm -> repeats the color corresponding to the previous word the number of times until a different word is encountered. 

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after another word, it causes the color associated with the previous word to repeat until a different word is used. For example, after ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" causes a continuation of ""blue"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green"". Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the output includes the color ""green"".

Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Analyzing the provided examples, it seems that ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow."" Each input precedes ""zup"" with various nonces (lug, dax, walm, wif) and consistently, the output following ""zup"" is ""yellow."" Therefore, based on the input-output pairs, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, it appears the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the duplication of the color associated with the preceding word. In all instances, the color word that comes directly before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output. Here are the mappings from the inputs to the outputs that supports this conclusion:

- In the first example, ""zup"" leads to the color ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- The second example has the sequence ""wif bluf"" resulting in ""red red"" (with ""wif"" corresponding to ""red"").
- The third example again contains ""zup bluf,"" with ""zup"" mapping to ""yellow"" and the output being ""yellow yellow.""
- The fourth and fifth examples are the same, with ""wif"" right before ""bluf"" resulting in ""red red.""

Using these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color word that precedes it in the output. If ""word"" maps to ""color,"" then ""word bluf"" maps to ""color color.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it. The repeated color words are not separated by any non-color word in the pattern. The number of repetitions, including the initial color word, matches the number of times the color word is said in total for the input line. Below are the observations that support this rule:

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""walm"" leads to ""red red red"", which counts as three repetitions of ""red"".

Input: lug wif lug walm zup walm wif
Output: blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
- ""lug"" means ""blue"", and followed by ""walm"", it gives ""blue blue blue"" (three times) as ""lug"" was mentioned thrice. ""zup"" means ""yellow"", followed by ""walm"", it gives ""yellow yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" was said three times.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" followed by ""walm"" gives ""blue blue blue"", which means there are three instances of ""blue"".

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- Here once again, ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" repetitions after another instance of ""zup"" giving ""yellow"".

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color word preceding it the number of times the mentioned color word appears in the whole input line.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""lug"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs. Let's examine the patterns:

- In every case, the word ""lug"" produces the output ""blue"".
- No other word consistently corresponds to ""blue"".

Now let's look at our evidence:

- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
  Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
  - ""lug"" is followed by ""walm wif walm"", which corresponds to ""blue blue red red red"". Since ""lug"" directly precedes the first ""blue"", it suggests ""lug"" may mean ""blue"".

- Input: lug zup wif lug
  Output: blue yellow red blue
  - ""lug"" appears at the beginning and end and corresponds to the first ""blue"" and the last ""blue"". ""zup"" and ""wif"" that come between ""lugs"" correspond to other colors.

- Input: lug zup bluf dax
  Output: blue yellow yellow green
  - Again, ""lug"" at the beginning corresponds to ""blue"". ""zup"" follows it with ""yellow"", ""bluf"" with another ""yellow"", and ""dax"" with ""green"".

- Input: wif lug
  Output: red blue
  - The word ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" follows and corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
  Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
  - ""lug"" is preceded and followed by different words but still corresponds to ""blue"".

Given these patterns, it's apparent that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" and is not influenced by its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: lug -> blue

To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:

1. Every time ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding output.
2. The appearance of ""dax"" in the input doesn't seem to affect the surrounding colors in the output - it independently maps to ""green.""

Based on this, we can infer:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: Every instance of the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at its position within each input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup wif bluf          Output: yellow red red
2. Input: wif zup dax bluf      Output: red yellow green green
3. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug  Output: green yellow red red blue
4. Input: dax lug wif bluf      Output: green blue red red
5. Input: dax zup bluf          Output: green yellow yellow

Analyzing these examples, we notice that ""bluf"" is associated with the color red, since each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, red appears in the output. Furthermore, we see that the number of reds in the output corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence:

- ""bluf"" is the 3rd word in the 1st input, and there's a corresponding double red in the output.
- ""bluf"" is the 4th word in the 2nd input, and there's a corresponding double green in the output.
- ""bluf"" is the 4th word out of 5 in the 3rd input, and the output has a double red followed by a blue (indicating that the last position yields a blue, which is not relevant to ""bluf"" specifically).
- ""bluf"" is the 4th word in the 4th input, and again there's a corresponding double red in the output.
- ""bluf"" is again the 3rd word in the 5th input, corresponding to a double yellow in the output.

The consistent rule seems to be that ""bluf"" generates a red color in the output, and the number of reds corresponds to the position of ""bluf"" in the input phrase minus one (because in examples 1 and 5, it is third in sequence and there are two reds in the output; in examples 2 and 4, it is fourth and there are two reds in the output; in example 3, it is fourth, but this example includes a fifth word that alters the pattern).

However, when we factor in example 5, the rule changes because the output color for ""bluf"" is suddenly yellow (position 3) instead of red. This inconsistency makes the general rule harder to pin down. Therefore, based on the data given, and accounting for a possible inconsistency or additional contextual rule we do not have insight into, the best deduction we can make is:

bluf -> generates a color in the output that is repeated once and reflects the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence minus one; typically, this color has been red, but there is one instance where the color was yellow. Further examples would be required to refine this rule with more certainty.
Reviewing the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" directly translates to repeating the previously mentioned color in the ""Input"" three times in the ""Output"". Here's how this rule applies:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""Output: blue blue blue"", suggesting that ""walm"" translates to repeating ""lug,"" which means ""blue"".

2. In the second example, ""zup wif lug zup walm"" yielded ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Here, the word ""walm"" follows ""zup"", which corresponds to ""yellow"". Thus, ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

3. The third and subsequent examples further support this rule—each time ""walm"" is used, it prompts the repetition of the color word (translated from the nonce word) that immediately precedes ""walm"".

Therefore, the rule stands as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color denoted by the preceding nonce word three times.

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided. There is no variation in its output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to the word ""yellow"".
Given the examples:

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red

- Input: wif bluf
  Output: red red

- Input: dax zup lug bluf
  Output: green yellow blue blue

- Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
  Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow

Rule:
bluf -> blue

Each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the output is ""blue."" Regardless of the other words in the input or their corresponding outputs, the occurrence of ""bluf"" consistently leads to ""blue"" in the output, which suggests that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding word to be repeated an amount of times equal to the number of letters in the word that directly follows ""walm."" If ""walm"" is at the end of the input, then it repeats the preceding word three times, which seems to be the default quantity. 

The color associated with each word that is being repeated (lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, wif -> red, dax -> green) is unaffected by ""walm""; instead, ""walm"" dictates the repetition pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow blue,red blue red yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug dax -> Output: blue green
Input: lug bluf dax lug -> Output: blue blue green blue

From these two examples, it seems clear that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, as it appears before both instances of the color blue in the output.

To confirm:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
Input: lug dax lug wif -> Output: blue green blue red
Input: lug dax wif -> Output: blue green red

In every occurrence above, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The examples provided consistently show that whenever the word ""dax"" occurs, the output is ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red."" Here is the evidence that supports this hypothesis:

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
- Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the last color, ""red.""

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
- ""Wif"" appears as the first word and corresponds to the first color, ""red.""

Input: zup wif lug zup walm
Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Wif"" is the second word and matches the second color, ""red.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- ""Wif"" precedes the last color, which is ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif
Output: green green red
- ""Wif"" is the last word and corresponds to the last color, ""red.""

No matter where ""wif"" appears in the sequence, it always corresponds to the output ""red.""

Thus, the rule can be expressed as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word, repeated twice. If another word follows ""bluf"" that is not a repetition, it is translated to its associated color only once.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to be repeated in the output (except when ""walm"" is at the end of the input, in which case it is applied to the previous word). For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (""lug walm""), the output is ""blue blue blue"". This replication applies to both ""wif"" (""wif walm"" -> ""red red red"") and ""dax"" (""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""). When other words follow ""walm"", like ""zup"" or ""lug"", they are not directly repeated after ""walm"", suggesting ""walm"" enforces repetition of the word it follows or precedes based on its position.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be a command to replicate the color associated with the adjacent word thrice.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the nearest word (preceding if ""walm"" is at the end of the input, following if otherwise) to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue,"" and it can be followed by a variable amount of additional color names depending on the context, with an unspecified word like ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" three times.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""dax"" can be directly deduced. Across all examples where the term ""dax"" appears, the output consistently corresponds to the color ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" we can examine the correspondence between the inputs and outputs. Let's look for patterns in each case:

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" therefore could correspond to ""red""

Input: dax lug wif bluf
Output: green blue red red
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""wif"" therefore seems to be consistent with the output ""red""

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
Output: green green red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" seems to again correspond to ""red""
- ""walm"" is a novel word, which seems to correspond to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Based on these examples, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Even when the position of ""wif"" changes in the input, its corresponding output remains the same. There is no obvious pattern that suggests ""wif"" changes its meaning based on context within these examples.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Following each instance where ""zup"" is used, the output includes the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. 

Here's what we observe:

- When ""zup"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" follows ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" or ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red"" as well, the output for ""zup"" is ""yellow.""
- ""zup"" placed between the same words (""lug dax"" vs. ""dax zup lug"") still results in ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
By analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf."" 

Let's compare components of the inputs with their outputs:

1. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

Looking at the relationships, whenever we see ""bluf"" in the input, the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" in the output is repeated two times.

Example analysis:
- In example 1, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice after.
- In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" is repeated twice after.
- In example 4, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""green"" is repeated twice after.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the color word (output) that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"" (input) to be repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> causes the corresponding color of the preceding word to appear twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the examples provided, let's first identify any patterns in the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   Rule Observation: ""zup"" associates with ""yellow"", ""wif"" with a single ""red"".

2. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   Rule Observation: ""dax"" associates with ""green"", ""zup"" with ""yellow"".

3. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Rule Observation: ""dax"" associates with ""green"", ""lug"" with ""blue"".

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Rule Observation: ""lug"" associates with ""blue"", ""bluf"" with ""blue"", ""wif"" with ""red"".

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   Rule Observation: ""zup"" associates with ""yellow"".

Now, let's look at the word ""walm"":

- In example 1, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""red"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" precedes three instances of ""green"" and comes after ""dax"".
- In example 3, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue"" and comes after ""lug"".
- In example 4, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""red"" and comes after ""wif"".
- In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in three instances of ""yellow"".

From this analysis, we notice that the word ""walm"" seems to replicate the color associated with the immediately preceding word three more times than it would without ""walm"". Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a multiplier for the color associated with the preceding word.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Walm repeats the color of the preceding word three additional times. Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm"", that color is output three extra times beyond its usual pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax
    ",Output: green yellow green,green yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
Based on the provided examples, I can deduce that the word 'dax' is linked to the color 'green'. Each time 'dax' appears in the input, the output includes 'green'. No other input elements consistently correlate with 'green'.

Further observations:
- 'lug' correlates with 'blue'
- 'zup' correlates with 'yellow'
- 'wif' correlates with 'red'

Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color output each time it is mentioned. Here's the color association based on the input and output pairs:

1. wif is followed by ""lug"" (wif lug), which gives the output ""red blue."" Therefore, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in this context since ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

2. wif is used before ""dax"" and ""lug"" (wif dax lug), giving us ""red green blue."" Since ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""

3. wif is used in combination with ""zup"" and ""lug dax"" (zup wif lug dax), which results in ""yellow red blue green."" Since ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""wif"" again is associated with ""red.""

4. wif is used in a sequence with ""zup"" and ""bluf walm"" (zup bluf wif walm). The outcome is ""yellow yellow red red red."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" is also ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" has not been previously identified but the repetition suggests that like other words, it consistently maps to the color red, ""wif"" maintains its correspondence to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Given the provided examples:

- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  
- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
  Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
  
- Input: lug zup
  Output: blue yellow
  
- Input: zup
  Output: yellow
  
- Input: zup dax wif zup
  Output: yellow green red yellow

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" by looking at the pattern of color words in the output corresponding to each input.

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   The word ""bluf"" falls between two ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow"" and precedes ""lug,"" which maps to ""blue."" In this output, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word preceding it, which is ""yellow"" in this case.

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax
   Output: blue green green red green
   Here, ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"" which maps to ""green"" and before ""wif"" which maps to ""red."" In this output, ""bluf"" again corresponds to a repetition of the color word preceding it, which is ""green"".

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   ""Bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which again maps to ""green,"" and in the output, ""bluf"" corresponds to that same color ""green"".

4. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which maps to ""red,"" and in the output, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   ""Bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and as before, the output corresponds to the repeated color ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Analyzing the examples provided, the pattern that emerges for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be associated with repeated color words based on the preceding word. Here's the breakdown:

1. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"", implying ""walm"" causes the color of ""dax"" (green) to be repeated three times.
2. ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red"", where the ""walm"" again causes the color of ""dax"" (green) to be output three times, and does not repeat ""zup"".
3. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"", indicating that when ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the color associated with ""zup"" (yellow) repeats three times.
4. ""zup dax walm"" translates to ""yellow green green green"", reinforcing the pattern that ""walm"" makes the color of the immediately preceding word repeat three times.
5. ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" gives ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red"", where ""walm"" causes ""lug"" (blue) to repeat three times first, and then causes ""zup"" (yellow) to repeat three times after that.

Based on these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: Walm -> when following another word, it causes the color corresponding to that word to repeat three times.

Hence, if ""x"" is a word that translates to color ""y"", ""x walm"" would output ""y y y"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue yellow,blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" This is evident as each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds directly to ""blue"" in the output. There is no example where ""lug"" results in a different color or is dependent on any adjacent word. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" in the examples given corresponds to the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" produces the output ""green.""
Given the examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output every time it is used.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's examine the inputs and their corresponding outputs closely:

1. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   The word ""zup"" appears twice, and both times it results in ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
   ""zup"" is the first word and corresponds with ""yellow"" in the output.

3. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
   The only word, ""zup,"" matches the only output color ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   ""zup"" appears second after ""lug"" and corresponds with ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""zup"" appears after ""dax"" and before three ""walm"" which corresponds with the first ""yellow"" following ""green.""

Based on the above observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"" with no apparent dependency on the context or its position. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that is mentioned last in the series. Here’s the breakdown:

- In the first input, blue is the last mentioned color, and where ""bluf"" is used, it translates to ""red,"" which is the color word that comes before ""bluf,"" not after.
- However, in the second input, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow, and the output for ""bluf"" changes to yellow, which is the color mentioned before it.
- In the third input, the only color before ""bluf"" is yellow, so ""bluf"" gives yellow again.
- The fourth input shows ""bluf"" coming after ""dax,"" which represents the color green, and the output for ""bluf"" is green.
- Lastly, in the fifth input, ""bluf"" immediately follows ""dax"" and the output is green again, which is the same color for ""dax.""

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it represents the color of the word that comes directly before it. Hence:

Rule: bluf -> the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Analyzing the examples and corresponding outputs, it seems that ""walm"" correlates with a repetition of the color directly preceding it in the sequence. Here's the evidence from the given examples:

1. Example: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Analysis: ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and ""walm"" repetition occurs after ""dax"", repeating ""green"".

2. Example: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repetition occurs after ""zup"", repeating ""yellow"".

3. Example: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Analysis: ""zup"" correlates again with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" repetition occurs after ""zup"", repeating ""yellow"".

4. Example: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Analysis: ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", and ""walm"" repetition occurs after ""lug"", repeating ""blue"".

5. Example: lug wif walm
   Output: blue red red red
   Analysis: ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and ""walm"" repetition occurs after ""wif"", repeating ""red"".

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

walm -> meaning: The nonce word ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word directly before it. 

Rule: If ""walm"" follows any word associated with a color, the output color will repeat for as many times as ""walm"" follows the word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: wif lug zup bluf wif bluf
    ",Output: red blue yellow blue red blue,red blue yellow yellow red red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples, the rules associated with the nonce word dax appear to be:

1. dax on its own results in the output ""green"" (Example 2).
2. dax used after another word results in ""green"" appended after the translation of the preceding word (Example 3, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", followed by ""green"").
3. dax used before another word results in the repeated output of ""green"" based on the number of words after dax (Example 5, ""walm"" does not have a corresponding translation, so ""green"" is repeated three times for dax walm, with each ""green"" possibly aligning with a word).

From the examples provided, it's clear that dax consistently translates to the word ""green."" However, in Example 4, dax seems to be used as a delimiter between sequences of other words, not changing its meaning but rather maintaining the same ""green"" output while other words translate according to their respective colors.

Rule: 
dax -> ""green"" (consistent across all examples). This can be represented within a sequence of other words or on its own, always resulting in the word ""green"" as its translation.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's examine how its appearance in the examples affects the output:

Example 1: ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> green red yellow yellow red red red
Example 2: ""zup bluf wif dax lug"" -> yellow yellow red green blue
Example 3: ""dax wif lug dax"" -> green red blue green
Example 4: ""wif dax"" -> red green
Example 5: ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" -> yellow green yellow green red red

Looking at these examples, when ""wif"" appears, it seems to be followed by the color ""red"" in the output:
- ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow""
- ""wif walm"" also results in ""red red""
- ""wif dax"" results in ""red green""
- ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red""
- ""wif lug"" results in ""red blue""

Additionally, ""wif"" never appears at the end of an input, and after ""wif"" there is always another word which correlates to a single-colored output (yellow, red, green, or blue) right after the ""red"" induced by ""wif.""

Considering these observations, it seems the rule is that ""wif"" precedes a word and changes the output to ""red"" regardless of what the following word is. The only exception seems to be when ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" where ""dax"" keeps its color ""green"" in the output rather than changing to another color. This might be because ""dax"" is the first word in the output sequence, so ""green"" may be the default starting color, and ""wif"" does not override it, suggesting that ""wif"" might signal a change in the color pattern but retains the color of ""dax"" when it follows.

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> makes the following word's output ""red"", unless the following word is ""dax.""

However, the rule remains slightly uncertain because we do not have an example of ""wif"" followed by ""dax"" where ""dax"" is not the first word or the only word after ""wif.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeating the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Rule: Whatever color is coded by the word right before ""bluf,"" output that color twice. 

In the given context:
- ""lug"" codes for ""blue,"" so ""lug bluf"" leads to ""blue blue.""
- ""wif"" codes for ""red,"" so ""wif bluf"" produces ""red red.""
- ""dax"" codes for ""green,"" thus ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green.""
- ""zup"" signifies ""yellow,"" hence ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow."" 

When ""bluf"" is used after two different colors, it only repeats the color of the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the provided input and output pairs to find a pattern.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" It seems that ""walm"" also translates to ""red.""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- In this case, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Since ""walm"" sits between two ""blue"" output colors, the occurrence of ""walm"" could also translate to ""blue.""

Input: lug walm zup walm
Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
- In this example, ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Both instances of ""walm"" produce ""blue"" in the output, which further suggests that ""walm"" translates to ""blue.""

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue
- Following the established patterns, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" In this input, ""walm"" translates to ""red.""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" and again ""walm"" seems to be associated with ""red.""

Upon reviewing the examples, ""walm"" seems to translate to ""red"" or ""blue,"" depending on the context. A possible rule could be that ""walm"" takes on the color of the preceding word or, in the absence of a preceding color word, defaults to red. However, there is not enough context to determine if ""walm"" always defaults to red without a preceding context, or if other rules may apply in different situations.

Rule: Walm -> takes the color of the preceding word. If there is no preceding color word, walm is red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:

Rule: In every example, the word ""lug"" is replaced with the color ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we observe a direct correlation between the nonce word 'wif' and the color 'red.' Each time 'wif' appears in the input, the output includes the color 'red' in the corresponding position. The pattern for the other nonce words like 'lug', 'zup', 'bluf', and 'dax', and their corresponding colors (blue, yellow, red, green), is also consistent, suggesting a rule where each nonce word maps to a specific color output.

Rule: wif -> red.
To determine the meaning of ""zup,"" we observe its use in different contexts across the examples provided. Here's what we see in each input-output pair:

1. Input: zup dax

   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

2. Input: zup bluf

   - The repeated ""yellow"" suggests that maybe ""zup"" and ""walm"" might mean the same thing, or that ""walm"" could be an effect of something in the sequence.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"", which is the same output for ""zup bluf"", indicating that ""bluf"" might also mean ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" in this context, showing that ""walm"" can have different meanings based on context.

Based on these observations, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the words that follow. The meaning of ""zup"" does not seem to be affected by context.

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

zup -> yellow
Bluf -> red
walm -> repetition of the last color mentioned. 

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used, it results in the repetition of the last mentioned color word for three consecutive instances.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, wif seems to correspond to the color 'red'. This can be seen by comparing the input and the output wherever the word 'wif' appears:

Input: lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue
- 'wif' is between two 'lugs' which correspond to 'blue', with 'wif' translating to 'red'.

Input: zup lug wif dax lug
Output: yellow blue red green blue
- 'wif' appears after a 'lug' (blue) and before a 'dax' (green), and in the output, 'red' is in the corresponding position.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- 'wif' is followed by 'walm', which doesn't have a direct translation, but given that the rest of the output is 'red red red', it seems 'wif' is 'red'.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow
- Here 'wif' is at the beginning and 'zup' is at the end (yellow), with the rest of the output being red, which supports 'wif' being 'red'.

Input: zup dax zup wif
Output: yellow green yellow red
- 'wif' is at the end of the sequence and translates to 'red' in the output, following the pattern identified above.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- When 'zup' appears on its own, the output is 'yellow'.
- When 'zup' appears with other words before or after it, the output still includes 'yellow' at the position corresponding to 'zup'.

Therefore, it seems that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow', regardless of the context it appears in.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red. The translation of ""bluf"" in each instance results in the word ""red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze each pair of input and output:

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""

So the ""walm"" here correlates with ""red.""

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""

Here, ""walm"" has the same output color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

Here, ""walm"" correlates with the same color as ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""

The ""walm"" in this sequence has the same output color as ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

Input: zup dax lug walm zup
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue""

Here, ""walm"" has the same output color as ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

From these inputs and outputs, we can deduct that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previous word that was mentioned. 

Rule: walm -> The color for the word ""walm"" is the same as the color for the word immediately preceding it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In each instance where ""lug"" is used, the color blue is output. The number of times ""lug"" appears does not affect the number of times ""blue"" appears in the output, suggesting that ""lug"" specifically means ""blue"" rather than indicating a repetition of the color blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. Each example that contains the word ""dax"" has ""green"" in the output at the same position. For example, if ""dax"" is the first word in the input, ""green"" is the first color in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""lug walm wif lug"" is input, the output is ""blue blue blue red blue"". The word ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" results in ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow"". Following from the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" here as well.
- When ""wif"" is input on its own, the output is ""red"". This further supports that ""wif"" translates directly to ""red"".
- In the example ""zup wif"", the output is ""yellow red"", aligning with the previous deductions that ""wif"" means ""red"".
- Finally, another solo input of ""wif"" again results in ""red"".

Drawing from all these examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's examine the relationship between the input and output pairs, focusing on the position where ""bluf"" appears and its corresponding output color:

1. **Example 1: dax wif dax zup bluf**
   - Output: green red green yellow yellow
   
2. **Example 2: zup wif bluf zup**
   - Output: yellow red red yellow
   
3. **Example 3: wif dax zup bluf**
   - Output: red green yellow yellow
   
4. **Example 4: wif bluf dax lug**
   - Output: red red green blue
   
5. **Example 5: wif bluf zup wif lug dax**
   - Output: red red yellow red blue green

Looking at these examples, when ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output color is ""red."" However, ""red"" also appears for the word ""wif."" Notably, ""bluf"" has also been followed by a yellow in one instance and a red in others. Let's refine our observations:

- In Example 1, ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup,"" and the resulting color is yellow.
- In Example 2, ""bluf"" is in the middle of two ""zup,"" both outputs being red and yellow, with ""bluf"" corresponding to red.
- In Example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" like in Example 1, and the resulting color is yellow.
- In Example 4, ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" producing red green.
- In Example 5, ""bluf"" again follows ""wif"" and precedes ""zup,"" which produces the sequence red red yellow.

From these observations, ""bluf"" seems to be potentially linked to the word following it, as the color changes depending on what word comes next. However, given that ""red"" is a common output for ""bluf,"" we can explore if ""bluf"" implies ""red"" unless followed by ""zup,"" where it would then imply ""yellow"":

- In every case where ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the corresponding color is yellow.
- In every other context, ""bluf"" corresponds to red.

Given this exploration, the likely rule is:

**Rule:**
bluf -> red when followed by any word except ""zup""; when followed by ""zup,"" bluf -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it three more times. Here's the breakdown of the rule based on each input-output pair:

1. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Rule: ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"", and the color ""blue"" is repeated three more times before the next color word ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"").

2. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"", and the color ""blue"" is repeated three more times.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   Rule: ""dax"" (which corresponds to ""green"") is followed by ""walm"", and the color ""green"" is repeated three more times.

4. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue"") is followed by ""walm"", and the color ""blue"" is repeated three more times.

5. Input: zup wif lug zup walm
   Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" (which corresponds to ""yellow"") is followed by ""walm"", and the color ""yellow"" is repeated three more times.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we can define ""walm"" as follows:

Walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the color indicated by the word immediately before it to be repeated three more times.

Rule: If ""x"" is a color word and ""walm"" follows ""x"" in an input sequence, then ""x"" is repeated three more times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif bluf
    ",Output: green red red,green red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" This is evident because in each instance where ""dax"" is present, the output includes the word ""green."" The context doesn't provide further conditions that modify the meaning of ""dax"" based on surrounding words or other factors. Therefore, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: dax -> ""green""
Analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a particular color in the output sequence. Here's what we can deduce from each example:

1. Input: lug wif bluf lug wif 
   Output: blue red red blue red 
   Observation: Following ""lug"" (blue), ""wif"" translates to ""red"".

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm 
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   Observation: ""wif"" comes after ""walm"" (blue) and produces ""red"". However, ""wif"" does not directly translate to ""red"" because it is repeated once while ""red"" is repeated thrice, which implies that ""wif"" has triggered a repeat of the preceding color.

3. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red 
   Observation: ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"" and the output is double ""red"". This example doesn't give us additional information about a preceding color because ""wif"" is the first word.

4. Input: dax lug bluf wif 
   Output: green blue blue red 
   Observation: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after the pair ""bluf"" (blue) and ""wif"", the color ""red"" occurs.

5. Input: wif zup 
   Output: red yellow 
   Observation: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"". Since ""wif"" comes before another color word, it turns into ""red"".

From these examples, we can infer that ""wif"" in some way converts to ""red"". However, when ""wif"" follows a color word, it seems to trigger the repetition of the color specified by the preceding word, suggesting that the term ""wif"" might lead to a color repetition effect, with ""red"" being the default color when no other color precedes it.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red by itself. When following another color word, it causes the preceding color to be repeated; when ""wif"" precedes another unrelated word, it stands alone as red.

Therefore, the induction for wif would be:

wif -> meaning: When alone or before a color word, it represents the color ""red""; when following a color word, it triggers a repetition of the preceding color.

Rule: When ""wif"" is alone or the first word, it stands for ""red"". When it follows another color word, it repeats that color in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs provided in all examples.
Rule: bluf -> the color that the preceding word represents, repeated twice. If ""lug"" means blue, then ""lug bluf"" means ""blue blue"".
walm -> the previous color word is repeated for the number of times `walm` is mentioned consecutively plus one. 

Rule:
- If `walm` is immediately preceded by the color word `zup`, the output is a sequence of ""yellow"" repeated as many times as `walm` appears, plus one.
- If `walm` is immediately preceded by `lug`, the output is a sequence of ""blue"" repeated as many times as `walm` appears, plus one.
- If `walm` is immediately preceded by `wif`, the output is a sequence of ""red"" repeated as many times as `walm` appears, plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

wif -> red

Rule: The word wif in the given examples translates to the color red regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". In every example, the instance of ""zup"" is translated to ""yellow"" in the output. Also, irrespective of the position of ""zup"" within the input sequence, its output remains consistent. Here is the inferred rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color ""yellow"" in the given examples.
Rule: ""bluf"" changes its meaning depending on the word that comes before it. If ""wif"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""red."" If ""zup"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" If there is no word before ""bluf,"" or the word before it is not ""wif"" or ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means the same color as the word preceding it.
walm -> meaning. By analyzing the sequences provided, it seems like the word ""walm"" means repeating the color of the immediately preceding word. So if the preceding word translates to the color blue, ""walm"" results in additional instances of the word blue until a new color word appears. 

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of ""lug"" in the inputs is translated to ""blue"" in the outputs.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green"". To verify the rule, we should confirm that the outputs are consistent when ""dax"" is presented in various positions within the inputs and in combination with different words. 

Observing the outputs:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, ""green"" is the first color listed in the output. This persists regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sentence.
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue"", as it appears consistently whenever ""blue"" is in the output.
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"".
- ""bluf"" and ""wif"" appear once each, correlating with a ""blue"" and ""red"" respectively.

It should be noted that ""zup"", ""lug"", ""bluf"", and ""wif"" appear to correlate with ""yellow"", ""blue"", ""blue"", and ""red"" respectively, regardless of their order in the input, which suggests a one-to-one correspondence between these words and their color outputs. 

As such, the rule for ""dax"" can be concluded as:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the prior word. Rule: When bluf follows a word, that word's corresponding color is repeated.
walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it three times.

Rule: If a color word is followed by ""walm,"" the output is the corresponding color word repeated three times.

    Rules:

dax -> meaning. Based on the provided information, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Rule: When the input is ""dax,"" the output is always ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to infer a rule for the meaning of ""wif."" Let's examine the role of ""wif"" in each scenario.

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by a ""red"" output, regardless of what precedes it.
- In the second example, the sole word ""wif"" also results in ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears twice, each time followed by ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" again consistently results in a ""red"" output.
- In the fifth example, both instances of ""wif"" are followed by ""red.""

From the above observations, we can conclude that the presence of ""wif"" in the input leads to a ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red
From the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

1. ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""wif dax"" corresponds to the output ""red green""
3. ""wif dax bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red green green""
4. ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green""
5. ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red""

Examining the outputs where ""zup"" appears, and considering the corresponding outputs for known words:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" suggests that since ""walm"" outputs a triple ""yellow"", then ""zup"" alone must correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" -> ""red green yellow red green green"" suggests that since we know ""wif dax"" is ""red green"" and ""wif dax bluf"" is ""red green green"", then ""zup"" in this context must correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""dax zup"" -> ""green yellow"" suggests that since ""dax"" is ""green"", then ""zup"" here must also correspond to ""yellow"".
- ""zup wif"" -> ""yellow red"" again suggests that since ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" must correspond to ""yellow"".

Given that in every instance where ""zup"" is used, the corresponding output always contains ""yellow"" as the output for ""zup"", we can deduce the meaning of ""zup"" as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples and their corresponding outputs, it seems that ""bluf"" is a rule indicating to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and with ""bluf"" following it translates to ""red red.""
- In ""dax zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats this color making it ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" repeats this color as ""blue blue.""
- The same pattern holds true for ""lug bluf dax bluf,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" with ""bluf"" repeating each color.
- In the last example, ""wif zup bluf wif dax,"" ""zup"" is the word that precedes ""bluf"" and corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" repeats the yellow color and the sequence ends with ""red green"" associated with ""wif dax.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples:

- Input: zup wif walm lug / Output: yellow red red red blue
- Input: zup lug walm / Output: yellow blue blue blue
- Input: lug walm / Output: blue blue blue
- Input: wif dax lug walm / Output: red green blue blue blue
- Input: dax walm zup walm / Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

We can see that when 'walm' is mentioned, it causes repetition of the color corresponding to the word preceding it. For example:

- In the first example, 'wif' corresponds to 'red', and 'walm' after it caused 'red' to be repeated.
- In the second example, 'lug' is associated with 'blue', and following 'walm' causes additional 'blue's.
- In the fourth example, 'lug' is followed by 'walm' which leads to repeated 'blue's.

The rule we can induce from this is that 'walm' repeats the color corresponding to the previous word in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, where each instance of 'dax' is translated to 'green', the meaning of 'dax' seems consistent. There does not appear to be any context in which the meaning of 'dax' changes—it consistently corresponds to the color green. Therefore:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Rule: 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
bluf -> blue

Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. When ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Analyzing the provided input/output examples, the occurrence of the nonce word 'walm' and its corresponding colored output gives us a pattern to work with:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
- This shows that 'walm' after 'zup' produces three 'yellow' outputs.

Input: lug dax walm wif -> Output: blue green green green red
- Here, 'walm' comes after 'lug dax' and produces three 'green' outputs, followed by 'wif,' which produces 'red.'

Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
- In this instance, 'walm' comes after 'dax lug' producing three 'blue' outputs.

Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
- 'Walm' follows 'lug' here, resulting in three 'blue' outputs; 'wif' gives 'red,' followed by another 'lug' producing 'blue.'

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- 'Walm' follows 'dax lug,' giving us three 'blue' outputs again, succeeding elements give 'green,' 'red,' 'red,' and 'green' in that order.

From these examples, we can deduce the following rule for 'walm':

Rule: When 'walm' appears in the input, it translates to the output color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, repeating three times.

Therefore:
walm -> Replicates the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the following pattern emerges for translating between the input and the output:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""zup"" corresponds to either ""yellow"" or ""blue"", but always ""yellow"" when immediately following or before ""lug""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- Each occurrence of ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
- Input: dax -> Output: green
- Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> Output: red green yellow red green green
- Input: dax lug bluf -> Output: green blue blue

From the inputs and outputs, we observe that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Even in sequences where ""dax"" appears multiple times, each occurrence of ""dax"" maps to ""green"". There are no counterexamples provided that show ""dax"" mapping to anything other than ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green. The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Analyzing the given examples, we can determine the meaning of the word ""wif"" by looking at what color it corresponds to in each context:

Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red
Here ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to red.

Input: wif zup dax bluf
Output: red yellow green green
Here ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to red.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
Here ""wif"" is in the middle, following ""lug"" which corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Again, ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to red.

Input: wif dax zup dax
Output: red green yellow green
Here ""wif"" is at the beginning and corresponds to red.

In all instances, regardless of position, ""wif"" corresponds to red. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
From the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word that directly precedes it. In each example, the color associated with the word before ""bluf"" is repeated in the output, which suggests that ""bluf"" represents a duplicative function relative to the previous word's color.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. The word 'walm' seems to mean the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. 

Rule: 'walm' represents a repetition of the previously mentioned color one or more times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sentence or the context created by adjacent words:

dax -> meaning. Rule: dax = ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to translate to a consistent color output, regardless of its position in the input string. It translates to ""red"" in each instance it appears:

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red  
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> Output: green blue blue blue green red red green  
Input: wif -> Output: red  
Input: dax bluf wif zup wif -> Output: green green red yellow red  
Input: zup wif dax wif bluf -> Output: yellow red green red red  

Thus, the rule we can deduce here is that ""wif"" output is consistently the color ""red"":

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" can be determined by the pattern of the color words that correspond to its occurrence.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output color for ""bluf"" is ""red"":
   - Input: wif dax zup bluf
   - Output: red green yellow yellow
   
   - Input: wif bluf zup
   - Output: red red yellow
   
   This suggests that ""bluf"" takes the color that precedes it.

2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""lug"", the output color for ""bluf"" is ""blue"":
   - Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
   - Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
   
   - Input: lug bluf
   - Output: blue blue

   - Input: lug bluf
   - Output: blue blue
   
   Again, ""bluf"" takes the color that precedes it, which in this case is ""blue.""

With the above observations, the rule for the word ""bluf"" is that it takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence. 

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of colors in the output. Specifically, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color that precedes it, three times. Here are the observations:

- Example 1 shows that 'wif walm' turns into 'yellow red red red', meaning 'walm' generates 'red' three times following 'wif' which corresponds to red.
- Example 2 does not actually demonstrate the rule as there is no color predecessor for 'walm' to determine the repetition.
- Example 3 again shows 'wif walm' resulting in 'yellow red red red', supporting the rule.
- Example 4 reveals 'wif walm' as 'blue red red red', and 'lug wif walm lug' becomes 'blue blue red blue red red red blue', where 'walm' follows 'wif' and 'red' is repeated three times.
- Example 5 is 'wif walm' turning into 'red red red', further solidifying the rule.

So, based on the examples given, the rule for ""walm"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" causes the previous color to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif bluf zup lug wif
    ",Output: red red yellow blue red,red red yellow blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look at the sequences where it appears and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: ""lug"" 
   Output: ""blue""
   
   - Here, ""lug"" alone translates to ""blue.""

2. Input: ""wif lug""
   Output: ""red blue""
   
   - ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and the output for ""wif"" is ""red.""

3. Input: ""dax lug dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue green blue blue blue""
   
   - ""dax"" precedes ""lug"" and the output for ""dax"" is ""green."" There's a ""walm"" at the end with a double ""blue"" in the output. This double ""blue"" doesn't correspond to the previous pattern, indicating that ""walm"" might influence the color output or the length of the output sequence.

4. Input: ""lug""
   Output: ""blue""
   
   - Consistent with the first example, ""lug"" alone results in ""blue.""

5. Input: ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax""
   Output: ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   
   - The pattern here is more complex, but ""dax lug"" consistently gives us ""green blue."" After ""walm,"" ""dax wif bluf dax"" correlates with ""green red red green."" ""wif"" and ""dax"" maintain their respective colors ""red"" and ""green,"" and ""bluf"" could be related to the repetition of ""red,"" but it is uncertain without more examples.

From these examples, it is clear that ""lug"" consistently represents the color ""blue."" However, there are instances that suggest other words might influence the repetition or sequence of colors in the output. Without further examples, it is difficult to fully understand how these other words affect the output sequence, but ""lug"" itself appears to simply mean ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Here's how that conclusion is reached:

- Every instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- ""dax"" does not seem to depend on context since it consistently translates to ""green"" regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it.

Here is the rule based on my analysis:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". There doesn't seem to be any context or position-based rules affecting the output for ""wif"", as it yields ""red"" regardless of its placement within the input string.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". Each example has a translation where ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color in the output.

Input: zup wif bluf   
Output: yellow red red   
(zup -> yellow)

Input: lug zup   
Output: blue yellow   
(zup -> yellow)

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug   
Output: green green red yellow blue   
(zup -> yellow)

Input: zup wif bluf zup   
Output: yellow red red yellow   
(zup -> yellow)

Input: lug zup lug   
Output: blue yellow blue   
(zup -> yellow)

From these examples, we can conclude that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to affect the subsequent color word by repeating it three times. Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it causes the output to repeat that color word three times.

So, walm -> meaning would be as follows:

walm -> When preceded by a color-related word, it reproduces the corresponding color in the output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup lug dax bluf
    ",Output: blue green yellow blue green blue,blue green yellow blue green green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of ""lug"" appears to be the color ""blue"". Therefore, every time ""lug"" is mentioned, it translates to ""blue"". 

Rule: lug corresponds to the color ""blue"".
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the given examples, regardless of its position in the input sentence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word is associated with a specific color in the output. We can try to match the nonce words with the colors as follows:

- In the first example, we see that ""wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue"". Since ""walm"" also appears in other examples and consistently corresponds to ""red,"" we can tentatively associate ""wif"" with ""red."" This is further supported by the appearance of ""wif"" at the end of the output string, which is again followed by the color ""red.""

- In the second example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" and ""walm"" appear before ""wif,"" and ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue"" in other examples. ""Walm"" has previously been associated with ""red."" So this suggests that ""wif"" is red, as in the first example, which is consistent with the output string.

- In the third example, ""wif bluf lug zup"" results in ""red red blue yellow."" From previous rules, we can deduce that ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" leaving ""wif"" as ""red"" and ""bluf"" also as ""red.""

- In the fourth example, ""wif lug zup bluf"" gives us ""red blue yellow yellow."" Based on prior patterns, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be ""yellow"" as well, consistently associating ""wif"" with ""red"" color.

- The last example presents ""zup walm wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow red."" Since ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""walm"" is ""red,"" and prior patterns suggest that ""wif"" is ""red,"" this example supports that ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red.""

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I'll compare each input with its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif bluf / Output: red red
2. Input: zup dax bluf / Output: yellow green green
3. Input: wif bluf dax walm / Output: red red green green green
4. Input: dax bluf wif zup dax / Output: green green red yellow green
5. Input: wif bluf lug / Output: red red blue

Now, let's examine what happens before and after ""bluf"" in each sequence:

1. Before bluf: wif / After bluf: None / Output: red red
2. Before bluf: dax / After bluf: None / Output: green green
3. Before bluf: wif / After bluf: dax / Output: red red green
4. Before bluf: dax / After bluf: wif / Output: green red
5. Before bluf: wif / After bluf: lug / Output: red red blue

From these examples, we can observe that every time ""bluf"" appears, the color immediately following ""bluf"" in the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" in the input. Thus, ""bluf"" could mean ""repeat the color of the previous word"". 

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"".
walm -> repeating the color word associated with the first word before ""walm"".

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, output the color associated with the preceding word three times. For instance, ""zup walm"" implies that ""zup"" is associated with ""yellow,"" so the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""dax"" is associated with ""green,"" so ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the provided examples, every occurrence of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"":

- Input: wif lug — Output: red blue (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".)
- Input: lug — Output: blue (Here, ""lug"" stands alone and corresponds to ""blue"".)
- Input: lug bluf — Output: blue blue (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"", and based on the structure it seems ""bluf"" might also correspond to ""blue"" although the data is insufficient to conclude this.)
- Input: lug wif walm — Output: blue red red red (Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""walm"" seems to correspond to ""red red red"" or a rule that generates three ""red"" tokens.)
- Input: lug — Output: blue (Again, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".)

Therefore:
lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
wif -> red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the input-output pairs provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"", since in each output it corresponds to the word ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color tied to the last word before it. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" therefore, ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeating.

2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" so ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeating.

3. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red,"" causing ""walm"" to result in ""red"" repeating.

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - Here, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow"" repeating.

5. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which is ""green,"" resulting in ""green"" repeating, and afterwards ""wif"" breaks the sequence with ""red.""

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated for as many times as ""walm"" occurs before another color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup lug
    ",Output: green yellow blue,green yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" always corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the Output. There doesn't seem to be any variation or context dependency on this translation. It remains consistent regardless of the surrounding words (""zup"", ""walm"", ""dax"", ""wif"", ""bluf"").

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here is the pattern in each example:

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow
Here ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" between ""blue"" and ""yellow.""

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red
Here ""dax"" translates to ""green"" between ""blue"" and ""red.""

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green
In this sequence, ""dax"" is ""green"" and comes after ""red.""

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red
""dax"" stands for ""green"" here, positioned between ""yellow"" and ""red.""

Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
Output: yellow blue red green green red
In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which also translates to ""green,"" and is preceded by ""red.""

From these examples, we can ascertain the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be determined by closely examining its correspondence with the output in each instance:

- Input: lug wif -> Output: blue red
- Input: wif walm dax -> Output: red red red green
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug -> Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
- Input: zup wif lug wif -> Output: yellow red blue red

From the above examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, ""red"" is produced in the respective position in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at the examples provided in various contexts and extract the pattern from the output:

1. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

2. Input: lug bluf zup
   Output: blue blue yellow

3. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

From the examples given:

- In example 1, ""zup"" is between ""wif"" and ""wif"" and the corresponding output is red yellow red.
- In example 2, ""zup"" follows ""bluf"" and the corresponding output color is yellow.
- In example 3, ""zup"" is the only input, and the output is a single yellow.
- In example 4, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the corresponding output is yellow yellow yellow.
- In example 5, ""zup"" follows ""wif"" and the output color is yellow.

Based on the data, it seems that ""zup"" does not depend on the context of previous words because at each occurrence of ""zup,"" the output is consistently ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words' associated colors. Thus, it might be inferred that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow"" in the outputs, and other words likely determine the rest of the color pattern.

Hence, the rule is: zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" I will analyze the outputs corresponding to each input where ""bluf"" appears, compare them, and try to find a pattern or rule that links ""bluf"" to a specific output color.

In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" correlates with the color green. No matter where ""bluf"" appears in the sequence (beginning, middle, end), it is always followed by ""green"" in the output. Moreover, no other words paired with ""bluf"" change or influence this output. For each occurrence of ""bluf,"" the output is consistently green, and it does not seem to be affected by position or surrounding words.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Input: dax bluf wif zup wif
Output: green green red yellow red

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.
To deduce the meaning of 'walm,' we should look for patterns in the input and output that are consistent across all examples. Here's the breakdown of each example:

1. lug dax walm wif
   Output: blue green green green red
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - After ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
   - After ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""blue.""

3. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - After ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""red.""

4. wif walm zup lug zup walm
   Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   - After the first ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""red.""
   - ""zup"" appears to correspond to ""yellow"" since each occurrence is followed by ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" However, after the second ""walm"" we see a repetition of ""yellow,"" not ""blue.""

5. dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   - This is a repetition of example 3, and the sequence confirms the previous association of ""dax"" with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red,"" and after ""walm"" there is a repetition of ""red.""

From these examples, a pattern emerges: 'walm' seems to act as a repeat command for the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it in the sequence. The number of repetitions seems to be three, based on the consistent outputs.

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the word before it to repeat three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color as follows:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- walm -> green
- wif -> red

Now, examining the outputs where ""lug"" appears, we notice:

- lug dax -> blue green
- lug -> blue

Whenever ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue"" regardless of the position or the words that follow. Therefore, the rule for ""lug"" is consistent across all examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
Given the examples provided, we can try to deduce the rule or meaning behind the nonce word ""dax."" We notice that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" This can be confirmed by looking at each input and output pair:

Input: dax walm wif -> Output: green green green red
Input: lug zup dax zup -> Output: blue yellow green yellow
Input: wif dax zup dax -> Output: red green yellow green
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: zup dax walm lug wif -> Output: yellow green green green blue red

No matter the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence or the other words present, the output for ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There is no clear context for what ""dax,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug"" each correspond to since they all generate different colored outputs except for the consistent output when ""wif"" is present.

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
bluf -> the same color as the previous word. Rule: If the previous word is ""lug,"" bluf means ""blue""; if the previous word is ""zup,"" bluf means ""yellow""; if the previous word is ""wif,"" bluf means ""red."" If bluf is the first word, the rule cannot be determined from the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's break down the examples and the associated outputs:

1. ""lug wif walm"" leads to ""blue red red red""
2. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
3. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
4. ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""
5. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" leads to ""green blue blue blue yellow red""

From these examples, we can infer the following:

- The word ""walm"" seems to cause repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.
- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""Walm"" after ""wif"" results in triple ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to triple ""red"" again.
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""walm"" after it results in triple ""green"".
- The fourth example again shows ""lug"" before ""walm"" resulting in triple ""blue"".
- The fifth example has ""dax lug walm"" making the sequence ""green"" (from ""dax"") ""blue"" (from ""lug"") and then ""blue blue blue"" (from ""walm""), followed by the colors for ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red).

Rule: ""walm"" after a word causes the output of the next color to be repeated three times. If we treat ""walm"" as a function, it can be said to take the color output of the previous word and repeat it thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
From the provided examples, it's clear that different words correspond to different colors. To deduce what ""dax"" means, we need to isolate examples where ""dax"" is used and see what color it corresponds to. Let's analyze each example:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow green blue
   - Here, ""dax"" correlates to ""green"".

2. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   - ""dax"" appears first and correlates to ""green"", while ""bluf"" correlates to ""green"" as well.

3. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - ""dax"" correlates to ""green"" once more.

4. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   - Again, ""dax"" correlates to ""green"".

5. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   - ""dax"" is at the end and correlates to ""green"".

In every instance, ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"". Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output. There is no context where ""wif"" translates to anything other than ""red,"" and it appears to be a one-to-one replacement, independent of surrounding words. It seems that the presence of ""wif"" in the input directly corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples given, each instance where the word 'zup' appears, the output is consistently 'yellow.' The position of 'zup' within a series of other nonce words doesn't affect its corresponding output. Other nonce words have their own outputs (e.g., 'wif' corresponds to 'red', 'dax' to 'green', 'bluf' to 'yellow', 'lug' to 'blue'), but 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' regardless of context.
To deduce what ""bluf"" means in this context, let's analyze the patterns for each given input and the resulting outputs:

Input: zup dax bluf | Output: yellow green green
Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
Input: dax zup bluf | Output: green yellow yellow
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug | Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Input: dax bluf | Output: green green

Looking at the outputs closely, the word ""bluf"" seems to always correspond to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. In each instance, the output for ""bluf"" is consistent: it is always ""green."" Based on the provided examples, this is the observable pattern.

Therefore, the rule we can induce is:

Rule: bluf -> green
walm -> replicated color of the previous word. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the output color to be repeated the same number of times as there are letters in the color word preceding ""walm"". For example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" leads to the color ""yellow,"" which has six letters, hence ""walm"" results in ""yellow"" being repeated six times. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which results in ""green,"" a five-letter word, ""walm"" leads to ""green"" being repeated five times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to figure out the rule that defines the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

1. Input: wif lug walm
   Output: red blue blue blue
2. Input: zup wif lug
   Output: yellow red blue
3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
4. Input: zup lug zup lug
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue
5. Input: dax lug dax wif dax
   Output: green blue green red green

From these examples, let's try deducing what ""lug"" means by looking at the correspondences between the inputs and outputs:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to the first ""blue"" in the output sequence.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again.
- In the third example, ""lug"" appears right before ""red red red,"" but ""wif"" equally corresponds to ""red,"" so we focus on ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue,"" following each instance of ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" sandwiched between ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, it appears that irrespective of the surrounding words, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Hence, we can infer the following rule:

lug -> meaning: blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the input and corresponding output. Let's look at each example:

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: zup dax lug dax
Output: yellow green blue green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Input: zup dax lug wif dax
Output: yellow green blue red green

One consistent rule that we can see is that every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears at the same position in the output. There doesn't seem to be a dependency on the context, that is, the word ""dax"" does not change its output based on the words around it. Therefore, we can infer:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, let's analyze the occurrences of the word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. lug wif lug -> blue red blue
3. dax wif -> green red
4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug wif -> blue red

It seems that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" Moreover, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" This leads us to conclude that the word ""wif"" does not seem to be influenced by context or neighboring words but has a direct translation.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green.
walm -> rule. Rule: repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence of words. Therefore, the rule can be described as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".

Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, regardless of its position or the presence of other words, the output includes the color ""red"". Other words in the examples (""lug,"" ""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf"") appear to correspond to different colors, but the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red."" Also, the output doesn't seem to depend on the position of ""wif"" within the input string, as it appears in different positions but still results in ""red"" in the output.

Hence, the rule is: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup"" from the given examples, we can identify patterns and correlations between the input and output pairs.

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

In this case, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" stands alone and the output is ""yellow"" which confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

From this input, ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" generates another ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"" or that there might be another rule governing the appearance of ""bluf"" in this sequence.

Input: zup dax lug zup
Output: yellow green blue yellow

The first ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and the second ""zup"" again to ""yellow."" This aligns with our previous findings and suggests that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""

Input: dax lug zup
Output: green blue yellow

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow.""

Based on the pattern that emerges from these inputs and outputs, we can determine that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Analyzing the examples, we can try to determine the meaning of the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

2. Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
   Output: green yellow red red blue

3. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green

4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red

5. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green

Looking at the outputs:

- In every instance where ""bluf"" appears, it translates to the color that immediately precedes it (if there is one).
- In the 3rd example, ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"" which maps to ""yellow."" Hence, ""bluf"" is also translated to ""yellow"" in this instance.
- In cases where ""bluf"" is directly after ""dax,"" which maps to ""green,"" it translates to ""green"" as well.
- In the 4th example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which is ""red"" and as such ""bluf"" also translates to ""red.""

Based on the above observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" the default color appears to be green, as shown in the 5th example.

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the preceding word; if there is no preceding word, the default is green.
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word

Rule: When the word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated three times. However, if another word is interjected between a color word and ""walm"" (like ""wif"" in the last example), it modifies the rule so that the color associated with the interjected word is also repeated, but four times instead of three.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, it seems that each input word corresponds to a specific color in the output.

- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color (as seen in the second example, where ""blue"" is repeated thrice after ""walm"")

Given that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in every example it appears, the rule for what ""dax"" means can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that:

- Whenever the input contains the word ""wif"" on its own, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with other words, it still translates to ""red,"" but the other words correspond to different colors.

Here's an observed rule for the word ""wif"" from the examples:

wif -> red

However, it's worth noting that there might be additional context or rules governing the meaning of ""wif"" that are not discernible from the given examples alone. For the purposes of these examples, the rule is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in output.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the nonce word ""zup"":

Input: wif lug zup
Output: red blue yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: zup dax zup
Output: yellow green yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- The second ""zup"" also corresponds to ""yellow"", reinforcing the initial rule.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" is not directly correlated, but given that the output is three times ""yellow"", it seems that ""walm"" is either another representation of ""zup"" or is translated as ""yellow"". However, without conflicting examples, this remains uncertain for ""walm"".

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- The second ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green""

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

By examining these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" can thus be formulated as follows:

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the correspondence between the input and the output in each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug  -> Output: red red blue
2. Input: wif bluf dax walm -> Output: red red green green green
3. Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
4. Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
5. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax -> Output: blue green green red green

Analyzing the examples:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color that follows it is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word.
- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" ""red"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" ""blue"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" ""green"" is repeated.
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" ""yellow"" is repeated.

From these observations, it appears that:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> repeats the color of the previous word.
Rule: ""walm"" seems to translate to ""blue"" repeated the same number of times as the preceding word, followed by ""red"".

Examples:
- In ""lug walm"", ""lug"" results in a single ""blue"", so ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""dax lug walm"", ""lug"" still corresponds to a single ""blue"", so once again, ""walm"" is ""blue blue"".
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"", ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"", so ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
- In ""dax zup walm wif walm"", ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"", so the first ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"", and then ""wif"" turns to ""red"", making the second ""walm"" ""red red red"".
- In ""zup walm wif"", ""zup"" corresponds to a single ""yellow"", so ""walm"" is ""yellow yellow yellow"". 

So: walm -> meaning. ""blue"" repeated the same number of times as the color word before it, followed by ""red"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow blue,yellow yellow yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Lug consistently corresponds to the color blue in all given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Every time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output is the color ""red"".
Given the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to always correspond to the color ""yellow.""

For clarity, here are the associations laid out from the examples:

- zup dax walm lug wif -> yellow green green green blue red
- zup lug -> yellow blue
- wif zup lug dax zup walm -> red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
- zup dax -> yellow green
- dax wif zup -> green red yellow

In each of these instances, ""zup"" is the trigger for the color ""yellow"" to be part of the output sequence. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns surrounding its use in the examples provided:

1. `wif bluf dax lug` -> `red red green blue`
2. `wif zup bluf wif dax` -> `red yellow yellow red green`
3. `zup bluf wif dax wif zup` -> `yellow yellow red green red yellow`
4. `wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug` -> `red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue`
5. `zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup` -> `yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow`

Let's inspect each position where ""bluf"" occurs and its respective output:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax lug"" and the output is ""red green blue.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif dax"" and the output is ""yellow red green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif dax wif"" and the output is ""yellow red green red.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""zup"" and ""lug walm dax lug"" and the output is ""yellow blue blue blue green blue.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" occurs twice and is surrounded by ""zup dax lug"" and ""dax zup,"" with the output being ""yellow green blue"" and ""blue green yellow,"" respectively.

From these observations, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" does not seem to be influenced by surrounding words, as its presence consistently results in ""yellow"" when it is preceded by ""zup"" and ""blue"" in all other contexts. Therefore, the rule might be that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and ""blue"" otherwise.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup"", ""blue"" otherwise.
Given the examples and their corresponding outputs, one can attempt to deduce the meaning or pattern associated with the word ""walm"" by examining what changes occur in the output when ""walm"" is present in the input.

First example:
- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm
- Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Second example:
- Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
- Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Third example:
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Fourth example:
- Input: wif lug dax walm
- Output: red blue green green green

Fifth example:
- Input: zup walm wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow red

From these examples, it looks like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""red,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""green,"" respectively. Each time these words are mentioned in the input, their associated color is repeated an equal number of times in the output until a different color word is encountered or the sequence ends.

Now, let's look closer at the word ""walm."" In each instance ""walm"" appears:

1. If ""walm"" occurs after a color word (like ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" ""dax""), the output repeats the color associated with the last mentioned color word three more times.
2. When ""walm"" appears at the end, it causes the color associated with the last mentioned color word to be repeated twice more than it would be usually.
   
Given this pattern, ""walm"" seems to be an instruction to repeat the last mentioned color three additional times. If ""walm"" is at the end, it will only cause a repetition of two times instead of three.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three additional times; if ""walm"" is at the end, repeat twice.

If we apply this rule:

For example 1:
- ""wif"" is 'red', so ""walm"" following it makes ""red"" repeat three more times. Then ""zup"" is 'yellow,' and another ""walm"" repeats 'yellow' two times since it's the end.

For example 2:
- ""wif"" is 'red', ""walm"" repeats 'red' three more times, ""dax"" is 'green,' ""zup"" is 'yellow,' ""wif"" is 'red' again, ""lug"" is 'blue,' and since ""walm"" is at the end, 'blue' is repeated twice.

This rule seems to fit all provided examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

The given examples always translate the word ""dax"" to ""green"" regardless of its position in the input. The other words in the examples seem to follow their own rules for translation (e.g., lug -> blue, zup -> yellow, bluf -> blue, walm -> yellow), but ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"".
Based on the provided examples, we can observe a consistency in the appearance of the nonce word ""wif"" and its corresponding output:

1. Whenever ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"".
2. ""Wif"" does not depend on the position in the sequence to output ""red"".

This can be confirmed by the examples where ""wif"" appears in different positions and alone, consistently translating to ""red"" in the output:

- Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
- Input: wif -> Output: red
- Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm -> Output: green green green red blue green green green
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow
- Input: wif -> Output: red

Based on these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" is that it translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color that corresponds to the previous word's color. When ""bluf"" follows the words ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""wif,"" or ""lug,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word before it. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow yellow.""
- ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""green green.""
- ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""red red.""
- ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf"" and translates to ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the color denoted by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"".
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with its output across different inputs:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" by itself results in ""red.""
   - ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and results in ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" corresponds with ""red.""
   - ""bluf"" seems to correspond with ""green.""
   - The sequence ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds with ""blue.""
   - ""walm"" when preceded by ""lug"" results in ""blue.""

4. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""dax"" corresponds with green.
   - ""walm"" in between ""wif"" and ""dax"" results in red.

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   - ""walm"" sits after a ""dax"" and yields ""green.""
   
Combining these observations, a rule starts to emerge about ""walm"":

- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""wif"" (or is preceded by ""wif""), the color is red.
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""dax,"" the color is green.

However, since the word immediately before ""walm"" determines its color, it seems ""walm"" may not have a color of its own but rather takes on the color of the word before it.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The rule is deduced by observing that each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the sequence or the presence of other words, ""green"" consistently follows, suggesting that ""dax"" represents ""green"".
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let's first look at the given examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug - Output: blue blue blue red blue
2. Input: zup dax wif - Output: yellow green red
3. Input: zup dax wif - Output: yellow green red
4. Input: dax lug wif walm - Output: green blue red red red
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup - Output: red red blue yellow

From these examples, we can observe:

- In example 1, the word ""lug"" appears both before and after ""wif"". However, ""lug"" is translated to ""blue"" before ""wif"" and ""red"" after it.
- In example 2 and 3, which are identical inputs, after ""wif"" there is no other input word, and the output ends with ""red"".
- In example 4, after ""wif"" is ""walm,"" which corresponds to three consecutive ""red"" in the output.
- In example 5, ""wif"" is the first word of the sequence, and the corresponding output starts with ""red"".

Given these observations, it appears that ""wif"" signifies a change in the color translation rule, specifically starting a sequence of ""red"" colors in the output, until the next non ""wif"" input word. It's not clear whether ""wif"" on its own always translates to ""red"" or if it triggers a state change that results in following words being translated to ""red"" until another color word appears.

Based on the above findings, the rule could be:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates the beginning of a sequence where all subsequent words (or the word following it alone if there are no other words) are translated to ""red"" until a different color word appears in the input.

Thus:
wif -> begins a sequence translated as ""red"" or translates itself to ""red"" when followed by any word not directly associated with another specific color.
zup -> meaning: Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"". 

Rule: The word ""zup"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to compare the inputs with the outputs and identify any consistent patterns that can be associated with ""bluf."" Let’s observe each example:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green."" 

2. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   - In this case, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red
   - Here ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - In this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   - In this longer sequence, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Based on these data points, we can note that ""bluf"" does not consistently map to the same color in the output. Instead, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word in the input sequence. In other words, the color associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word that comes just before it. Let’s write this as a rule:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. 

Therefore, the answer is:
bluf -> Takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. In each output, the sequence of the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color indicated by the word immediately preceding ""walm"".
2. The number of repetitions equals the number of syllables in the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Here are the breakdowns of the examples:

Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red. ""wif"" has one syllable, so ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.

Input: zup wif dax walm
Output: yellow red green green green
Explanation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to green. ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Explanation: ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to blue. ""lug"" has one syllable, so ""walm"" results in ""blue"" repeated three times.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
Explanation: ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to red. ""wif"" has one syllable, so ""walm"" results in ""red"" repeated three times.

Input: zup dax walm zup wif
Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Explanation: ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to green. ""dax"" has one syllable, so ""walm"" results in ""green"" repeated three times.

So the rule for the meaning of ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color of the preceding word as many times as the number of syllables in the word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

This appears to be the only consistent element across all examples, given that the other words in the input result in different colors in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Using the input-output pairs provided, it can be seen that whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the context in which ""dax"" is used.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red"". The meaning of ""wif"" does not seem to change with context, as it consistently corresponds to ""red"" in each example.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the rule pertaining to the nonce word ""zup"" as it relates to the colors in the output:

1. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
2. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
3. wif zup -> red yellow
4. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
5. wif zup bluf lug walm -> red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Given the outputs, it appears that the word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" in each instance. When breaking down the input and output pairs, we can see that each occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" in the output. No matter what position ""zup"" is placed in the input sequence, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Reviewing the given examples, my aim is to derive what ""bluf"" corresponds to in the outputs:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
Input: dax bluf zup -> Output: green green yellow
Input: lug wif lug bluf -> Output: blue red blue blue

Looking at the first and last examples, we see that ""bluf"" appears immediately after ""wif"" and ""lug"", and the corresponding output is a repetition of the color that came before it (red and blue, respectively).

In the middle two examples where ""bluf"" is not at the end, it again seems to cause a repeat of the color that precedes it in the following sequence (once after ""lug"" to produce blue and once after ""dax"" to produce green).

From these observations, one possible rule can be deduced:

Rule: bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before bluf.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns within the provided examples. There's a consistent output occurrence with the word ""walm"" – it consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Let's examine the examples one by one:

- Input: ""dax walm lug"" -> Output: ""green green green blue""
- Input: ""lug zup walm lug"" -> Output: ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue""
- Input: ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> Output: ""blue red green yellow yellow yellow""
- Input: ""zup walm dax"" -> Output: ""yellow yellow yellow green""
- Input: ""wif walm dax zup"" -> Output: ""red red red green yellow""

Across all examples, ""walm"" is followed by three ""yellow"" in the output. Additionally, the other words in the input (""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""wif"") translate to a single color in the output (""green,"" ""blue,"" ""yellow,"" and ""red,"" respectively).

Therefore, the rule can be described as:

Rule: The word ""walm"" consistently translates to three occurrences of the word ""yellow"" in the output.

Written concisely:

walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug"" from the provided examples, let's first record the pattern in which ""lug"" appears and the corresponding output:

1. ""lug walm zup lug walm"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
2. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
3. ""lug wif zup wif walm"" -> Output: blue red yellow red red red
4. ""dax lug"" -> Output: green blue
5. ""lug zup dax wif"" -> Output: blue yellow green red

From these examples, we notice that every appearance of ""lug"" is followed by the color ""blue"" in the output. We do not have an example where ""lug"" is associated with a different color; therefore, we can conclude that ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in each instance it appears.
Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Examining the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the rule governing the word ""zup"":

Input: zup bluf wif walm  
Output: yellow yellow red red red  
Rule: zup corresponds to the first color, which is yellow.

Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif  
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red  
Rule: In this sequence, zup occurs twice. When zup first appears, it follows two occurrences of blue but precedes yellow. When it appears the second time, it is followed by blue, then yellow red, again corresponding to yellow.

Input: zup wif bluf  
Output: yellow red red  
Rule: zup is the first word and corresponds to the first color, yellow.

Input: zup wif walm lug  
Output: yellow red red red blue  
Rule: zup as the first word results in yellow, with subsequent colors not repeating yellow.

Input: dax lug zup  
Output: green blue yellow  
Rule: zup is the last word and corresponds to the last color, yellow.

Considering these examples, we can deduce the following rule:

zup -> meaning: Zup means ""yellow"". In all instances where zup appears, it corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" has the following rule:

walm -> meaning. The meaning is to repeat the color tied to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word, it takes the color associated with that word and outputs it three times. For instance:
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" since ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color in the output. Here's how the words seem to correspond to colors:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green""

It appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". Given this pattern, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or context in the examples provided.
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each given example, 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the input-output pairs for patterns:

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug bluf (repeated, same input-output pair as above)
Output: blue blue

Input: dax zup lug bluf
Output: green yellow blue blue

From these examples, it seems that the output colors are directly associated with the words given in the input before ""bluf."" Also, since ""bluf"" is the last word in each input, we can see that the color last outputted is directly correlated with the word preceding ""bluf."" The color is repeated for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

Based on the data:

- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green.""
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red.""
- ""lug"" correlates with ""blue.""

Therefore, ""bluf"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of 'walm' seems to be context-dependent and related to the word that precedes it. Analyzing the examples:

Input: dax lug wif walm
Output: green blue red red red
- Here, 'walm' seems to result in repeated 'red'.

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- 'walm' follows 'zup' and the result is repeated 'yellow'.

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- 'walm' follows 'lug' and the output is repeated 'blue'.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- 'walm' follows 'zup' and 'wif', resulting in repeated 'yellow' and repeated 'red' respectively.

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- 'walm' follows 'lug' again with the output repeated 'blue', then 'zup' results in 'yellow'.

From these observations, it can be induced that 'walm' causes a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: walm -> The nonce word 'walm' repeats the color associated with the preceding word. For instance, if 'lug' (blue) comes before 'walm', the output will be multiple instances of 'blue'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, the rule appears to be that the word ""lug"" is consistently mapped to the color blue.

Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" is:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color blue.
Based on the examples provided, it would appear that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the outputs. The output provides a color for each word in the input, and in each case where ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green.""

Here is the deduced rule based on the examples:

dax -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

dax -> ""green""
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced by its consistent associated output in different sequences:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is always ""red"".
- The position of ""wif"" in the input does not affect its output—it is always paired with ""red"" regardless of whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.

Rule:
wif -> red.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to changing the color of the word before it, except when ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", which results in ""red red"" regardless of the preceding word.

Analyzing the given examples:

- When ""lug"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" causes the following color to switch from ""blue"" to ""red,"" then back to ""blue.""
  
  Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
  
  The pattern of colors changes with the presence of ""bluf"" after ""lug.""

- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" causes the next color to be ""red.""
  
  Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
  Output: yellow red red yellow blue
  
  There is no ""lug"" before ""bluf"" for the third color, but it becomes red nonetheless, implying a rule where ""wif"" previous to ""bluf"" results in ""red.""

- When ""wif"" is before ""bluf,"" no matter what the previous word is, the output is ""red red.""
  
  Input: lug walm wif bluf
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  
  Input: wif bluf lug zup
  Output: red red blue yellow
  
  Regardless of ""lug"" and ""walm,"" ""wif bluf"" outputs ""red red.""
  
- When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" does not seem to change this, which might suggest that ""bluf"" does not change the color for ""dax.""

  Input: dax bluf
  Output: green green

Considering these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be related to changing the output based on the word that precedes it, but the exact mechanism remains slightly ambiguous due to limited context. However, the consistent rule we can discern is the effect of ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" which always yields ""red red.""

bluf -> Depends on previous word, generally changes the output color except when preceded by ""wif,"" which results in ""red red.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" it's useful to look for patterns in each example. In the given examples, every time ""walm"" appears, it seems to modify the color associated with the following word. Here's how it plays out across the examples:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
3. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
5. lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red

From these patterns, it seems that ""walm"" causes the following word's associated color to repeat one more time than it would normally occur without ""walm."" In cases where ""walm"" is at the end of the sentence, it repeats the color of the word it immediately follows.

So, if we break it down:

- ""dax"" normally produces the color green. When preceded by ""walm,"" it produces the color green one additional time.
- ""wif"" normally produces the color red. When preceded by ""walm,"" it produces the color red one additional time.
- ""zup"" normally produces the color yellow. When preceded by ""walm,"" it produces the color yellow one additional time.
- ""lug"" normally produces the color blue. When preceded by ""walm,"" it produces the color blue one additional time.

Hence, ""walm"" can be understood as an operation that repeats the color of the following word once more than its usual number.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the following word one additional time.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the given examples, we can induce the following rules for the word ""lug"" and its meaning:

Input: lug
Output: blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue.""

Input: zup lug wif
Output: yellow blue red
Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to imply a repetition of the preceding color word three times.

Input: lug
Output: blue
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue,"" consistent with previous observations.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" again seems to imply a repetition of the preceding color word, in this case, ""blue,"" three times.

Based on these examples, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be:

lug -> ""blue""

Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the provided examples corresponds to the color word ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> ""red"" when followed by ""wif"", ""green"" when it is either at the beginning or followed by any other word except ""wif"", and ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" seems to be consistent across all examples. In every instance where ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow."" There is no indication that the meaning of ""zup"" is context-dependent or changes in relation to other words. It simply translates to the color ""yellow"" each time.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will look at the consistent patterns in the examples provided. Here is the data:

1. zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug -> yellow green green red yellow yellow blue
2. zup lug bluf -> yellow blue blue
3. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
4. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
5. lug bluf -> blue blue

Upon examining the above pairs, we see that the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"" is translated to the same color word that is translated from ""bluf"". Therefore, the rule we can derive from these examples is:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color translation of the word immediately preceding it.

Using this rule:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of bluf is that it translates to the same color as the word immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word prior to it in the sequence for a number of times equal to the number of letters in the word.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""walm"" is followed by the color ""blue"" three times (since ""lug"" has three letters), and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" again, and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" three times since ""lug"" has three letters.

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""walm"" is followed by ""blue"" three times (since ""lug"" has three letters).

Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" three times (since ""wif"" has three letters). ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" ""Walm"" then repeats the color ""yellow"" three times (since ""zup"" has three letters).

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" has no direct correspondence since it's followed by ""lug"" which has its own color ""blue."" After ""lug,"" ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times (since ""lug"" has three letters), followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"" and finally ""lug"" again corresponding to ""blue.""

Rule:
walm -> Repeat the previous color for the number of times equal to the number of letters in the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Using the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax."" By examining the Input-Output pairs, we can make some initial observations:

1. When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is green.
2. When ""dax"" appears after ""wif,"" ""bluf,"" or ""zup,"" the output is still green, but the word before it changes the output color: ""wif"" leads to red, ""bluf"" leads to green, and ""zup"" leads to yellow.
3. No other output colors are provided for other contexts, so we are limited to the pairings in the examples.

From this, we can infer that ""dax"" correlates consistently with the output color green, regardless of its position in the input string or the words that appear with it.

Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" is present in the input, the output includes the color green.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs and look for patterns.

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- Here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug wif,"" which outputs ""blue red."" Since ""lug"" alone corresponds to ""blue"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" the ""bluf"" preceding them seems not to affect their individual output colors.

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" in this context doesn't seem to add any new color. Thus, ""bluf"" may either repeat the preceding color or could be a null operation that doesn't change the output.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- As above, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" does not seem to change the output here either. It could possibly mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- Notice here, ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" yet it doesn't produce ""blue red"" as ""lug wif"" would. Instead, it repeats ""red"" before following the normal ""lug wif"" pattern.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" does not seem to change the output, reinforcing the idea that ""bluf"" might mean ""repeat the previous color.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""bluf"" appears to indicate the repetition of the previous color mentioned. If there's no previous color (shown in the second example), it possibly doesn't affect the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" means ""repeat the previous color.""
The given examples suggest that ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it, repeated three times. From the examples, we can match the non-nonce words with a color:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Now, when ""walm"" follows these words, the output is the color corresponding to the word that precedes ""walm"", repeated three times.

Let's look at the examples to deduce the rule:

1. ""zup lug walm"" results in ""yellow blue blue blue"". The word ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color blue, replicated three times in the output.
2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" comes before ""walm"" and corresponds to green, which is replicated three times following it.
3. ""lug walm zup walm"" results in ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow"". Each instance of ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color of the word before it (""lug"" for blue and ""zup"" for yellow).
4. ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"". The word ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and corresponds to the color red, which is replicated three times following it.
5. ""dax wif walm"" results in ""green red red red"". The word ""wif"" comes right before ""walm"" and corresponds to red color, which is replicated three times.

Based on the examples above, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it causes the color associated with the immediately preceding word to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning. Rule: If a color word precedes ""walm"", the output will be the color associated with that word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug zup dax lug
Output: blue yellow green blue

Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: dax zup
Output: green yellow

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" always results in the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, regardless of the context or the words around it. Therefore, it seems that the rule is quite straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to be a command that duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples provided:

- The word prior to ""bluf"" has a color associated with it.
- ""Bluf"" causes the output to be two instances of the color associated with the previous word.

Let's apply this to the examples:

- **Input:** dax bluf => **Output:** green green (dax is followed by bluf, resulting in the color associated with dax being duplicated)
- **Input:** wif bluf => **Output:** red red (wif is followed by bluf, resulting in the color associated with wif being duplicated)
- **Input:** zup walm lug wif bluf => **Output:** yellow yellow yellow blue red red (wif is followed by bluf, resulting in the color associated with wif being duplicated)
- **Input:** wif lug zup bluf => **Output:** red blue yellow yellow (zup is followed by bluf, resulting in the color associated with zup being duplicated)
- **Input:** dax bluf wif => **Output:** green green red (dax is followed by bluf, resulting in the color associated with dax being duplicated, and then wif is not duplicated because it isn't followed by bluf)

Based on the above, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> Duplicate the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the information provided from the input and output sequences, we can deduce a rule for what ""walm"" might mean in this specific context. Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: zup walm dax lug | Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
2. Input: lug wif dax walm zup | Output: blue red green green green yellow
3. Input: dax walm zup lug dax | Output: green green green yellow blue green
4. Input: dax wif walm | Output: green red red red
5. Input: dax walm wif zup | Output: green green green red yellow

In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" is followed by the color yellow in the output. In example 2, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output for ""walm"" is green, which is the same color assigned to ""dax"" in other examples. Example 4 does not provide a clear indication of ""walm's"" color as it is followed by a ""red"" color without another context.

Given this, we can tentatively propose that ""walm"" may mean ""repeat the previous color."" Here's the rule based on the observation:

Rule: ""walm"" means to repeat the color corresponding to the previous word.

However, note that example 4 does not fit this rule well, as it would suggest ""walm"" after ""wif"" would result in a red output, which does not occur. Without additional examples or information, it's challenging to reconcile example 4 with the other examples. Nonetheless, based on majority occurrences, we are inducing that the rule might be as follows, with exception or context for example 4 remaining unclear:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word (in majority of examples provided).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the color red appears in the output. Additionally, other words correspond to different colors consistently: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" also corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" corresponds to yellow as well.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently leads to the output ""yellow."" Thus, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the pattern observed in the examples given, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. None of the other words in the inputs (wif, zup, lug, walm, dax) consistently correspond to ""red"" in the output; they correspond to other colors or follow different rules.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the output repeating the color corresponding to the previous word before ""walm"". That is, whenever ""walm"" appears, the color term before ""walm"" is repeated multiple times in the output. 

Here’s the breakdown:

1. Input: ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug""
   Output: ""red yellow yellow blue **blue blue** green blue""
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output has ""blue"" repeated twice after ""walm.""

2. Input: ""wif walm zup""
   Output: ""red **red red** yellow""
   Analysis: ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" which is ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice more after ""walm.""

3. Input: ""lug wif dax walm zup""
   Output: ""blue red green **green green** yellow""
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and ""green"" is repeated twice right after ""walm.""

4. Input: ""dax lug walm""
   Output: ""green blue **blue blue**""
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""lug"" which means ""blue,"" and ""blue"" is repeated twice after ""walm.""

5. Input: ""wif walm""
   Output: ""red **red red**""
   Analysis: ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" which translates to ""red,"" and ""red"" is repeated twice.

Taking these into consideration, the rule seems to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated two additional times in the output.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning: Repeat the preceding color twice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the examples provided, we can induce the following rule:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""blue.""

Let's verify with each input-output pair:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (Here ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".)
2. Input: zup lug wif dax lug -> Output: yellow blue red green blue (Both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"".)
3. Input: dax zup lug bluf -> Output: green yellow blue blue (Here ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue"".)
4. Input: lug zup -> Output: blue yellow (The first word ""lug"" gives the color ""blue"".)
5. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug -> Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue (Here, both instances of ""lug"" correspond to ""blue"".)

Based on these examples, the rule is consistent. Therefore:

lug -> blue. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
The examples provided show the word ""dax"" consistently corresponding to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sentence or the other words around it. 

Therefore, the rule induced from the examples is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". 

Written in the requested format:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

1. In the first example when ""zup"" follows ""lug dax,"" the output is ""yellow,"" and when it follows ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" changes from ""green"" to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

2. In the second and third examples, ""zup"" is included after ""wif"" and the output is ""yellow."" Moreover, the third example has an additional ""walm"" which changes its corresponding output from ""green"" to three times ""red.""

3. The fourth example includes ""zup"" after ""lug,"" and its output is ""yellow,"" and the ""walm"" after it has the same treatment as previous examples, changing ""green"" to ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. In the fifth example, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" and again the output is ""yellow.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" However, when following ""walm,"" the presence of ""zup"" changes the output of ""walm"" from ""green"" to three repeats of the color that would precede the repeat sequence (e.g., ""lug walm"" would be ""blue green"" but with ""zup"" it changes to ""blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""blue"" is the color preceding ""walm"").

So, with the information given, here's the rule for ""zup"":

Rule: zup -> changes the output to ""yellow."" When following ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" is changed to be three times the output color that would precede ""walm"" without ""zup.""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" leads to the output of a color word being repeated once. This repetition occurs regardless of what the color word is. 

Based on the rule observed, here is the meaning assigned to the nonce word ""bluf"":

bluf -> the next word's associated color is repeated once.

Here is the explanation for each example:

- ""zup bluf wif walm"" results in ""yellow yellow red red red"" because ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow, followed by ""bluf"" which causes the next color word's output to be doubled, in this case ""wif"" which is red, followed by ""walm"", which continues the pattern for red.
- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" is associated with the color blue and ""bluf"" causes the blue to be repeated.
- ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" results in ""blue blue red blue red red red blue."" ""Lug"" is blue, repeated by ""bluf,"" followed by ""wif"" which is red, another ""lug"" which is blue, then ""wif"" again for red, ""walm"" which continues the red, and ending with ""lug"" for blue.
- ""wif bluf dax"" results in ""red red green"" because ""wif"" is red, doubled by ""bluf,"" followed by ""dax"" which is green.
- ""dax wif dax zup bluf"" results in ""green red green yellow yellow"" because ""dax"" is green, followed by ""wif"" which is red, ""dax"" again for green, ""zup"" which is yellow, and ""bluf"" causes the yellow to be doubled.

In summary:

bluf -> causes the next word's associated color to be repeated once.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples provided:

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From these examples, we can observe a pattern:

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""lug"" is followed by ""walm,"" the following pattern has repeating ""blue."" However, the number of times ""blue"" is repeated is not consistent; it's one fewer than the position of ""lug"" when counting from the right end of the input.
   For example:
   - ""lug dax walm"" has ""lug"" as the first word (from the right, third word), resulting in two ""blue.""
   - ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" has ""lug"" as the second word (from the right, fourth word), resulting in three ""blue.""

2. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""dax"" is followed by ""walm,"" the following pattern has repeating ""green."" The number of ""green"" seems to be one more than when ""lug"" is used.
   For example:
   - ""dax walm"" has one ""green"" followed by ""walm,"" resulting in three ""green.""
   - ""lug dax walm"" has ""lug"" and ""dax"" before ""walm,"" resulting in one ""blue"" and three ""green.""

3. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""wif"" precedes ""walm,"" there are no additional ""red"" added, except for the one corresponding to ""wif"" itself.

4. ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" These colors only show up as many times as they appear in the input. There is no repeating pattern for them directly associated with ""walm.""

With these observations, it seems ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the directly preceding word, with the following intricacies:

- If the preceding word is ""lug,"" there will be blue repeated one fewer times than the position of ""lug"" from the right end of the input.
  
- If the preceding word is ""dax,"" there will be green repeated, and the number of repetitions is equal to the position of ""dax"" from the right end of the input.

Therefore, ""walm"" seems to function as a command to repeat the color of the preceding word a specific number of times based on its position from the right (prior to ""walm""). For ""lug,"" it's one less than its rightward position, and for ""dax,"" it's exactly the rightward position.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word a number of times dependent on its position from the right end of the input: one fewer for ""lug"" and equal to the position for ""dax"". Other words not directly before ""walm"" do not influence the repetition and are translated into their respective colors once.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ","Output: blue
",blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule:
- The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the word ""dax."" Each instance of input and corresponding output suggests a color code for each word. Let's examine each input and its output:

1. Input: ""zup dax wif"" | Output: ""yellow green red""
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - wif -> red

2. Input: ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" | Output: ""green green red blue yellow""
   - dax -> green
   - bluf -> green
   - wif -> red
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow

3. Input: ""zup dax"" | Output: ""yellow green""
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green

4. Input: ""dax bluf lug wif"" | Output: ""green green blue red""
   - dax -> green
   - bluf -> green
   - lug -> blue
   - wif -> red

5. Input: ""lug zup dax lug"" | Output: ""blue yellow green blue""
   - lug -> blue
   - zup -> yellow
   - dax -> green
   - lug -> blue

In all instances, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, based on the information provided, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples and the corresponding outputs, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" In every instance where the word ""wif"" appears, the output includes the color red in the corresponding position. Additionally, there is no instance provided that contradicts this rule.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input. Additionally, ""wif"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red"" and ""blue,"" respectively. However, the colors follow the order of the words in the input.

Thus, the rule is:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- The output is a sequence of colors that follow the same sequence as the input words and their associated colors.
From the examples provided, it is apparent that the output color associated with the word ""bluf"" is consistently the same color as the word prior to it. To illustrate:

Example 1: ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and also results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""

Example 2: ""wif bluf dax lug"" -> ""red red green blue""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and also results in ""red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""

Example 3: ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" -> ""green green yellow yellow green""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and also results in ""green""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and also results in ""yellow""
- ""dax"" results in ""green"" again

Example 4: ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and also results in ""red""

Example 5: ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and also results in ""blue""
- ""wif"" results in ""red""

Based on this analysis, we can deduce the rule for ""bluf"":

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word.
walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" indicates repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. The number of instances of the color repeated corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm
    ",Output: yellow yellow yellow,yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can try to induce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by looking at the consistent output it generates and comparing it with the other words whose meanings we can deduce through repetition and differences in the examples provided.

- Example 1: ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green""
- Example 2: ""dax wif lug"" translates to ""green red blue""
- Example 3: ""dax zup"" translates to ""green yellow""
- Example 4: ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow""
- Example 5: ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red""

Here's what we can induce:
1. Each appearance of ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
2. No other word besides ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Thus, the consistent pattern is that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" we analyze the correlation between the input and output pairs given in the examples.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""

Input: lug wif bluf lug wif
Output: blue red red blue red
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates to ""red""

Input: dax wif
Output: green red
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""

Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates to ""blue""

From the fourth example, we see an inconsistency; ""bluf"" is associated with both ""red"" and ""blue"" in different instances. This suggests that ""wif"" could be affecting the color output of the word that follows it. Perhaps ""wif"" reverses the color output of the word following it, but since ""bluf"" is shown to give ""red"" after ""wif,"" this does not seem to be the case. Let's check the fifth example to see if there is further clarification.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""bluf"" correlates to ""red"" when it comes after ""wif,"" but to ""blue"" when it follows other words.
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""

From these examples, it seems that ""wif"" has a consistent output of ""red"" irrespective of its position or the words around it. The confusion with ""bluf"" in the fourth example might be an anomaly, or there could be a secondary rule affecting it that is not clear from the examples provided.

Rule: wif -> red. ""Wif"" consistently correlates to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs:

Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

Here, the color ""yellow"" is outputted first, which corresponds to ""zup"" being the first word in the input.

Input: zup -> Output: yellow

Here, the only input is ""zup,"" and the output is exclusively ""yellow.""

Input: zup dax zup wif -> Output: yellow green yellow red

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" both times it appears in the input.

Input: dax zup wif zup -> Output: green yellow red yellow

Again, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it appears.

Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow

Once more, ""zup"" is associated with the output ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" seems to be that it duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's the analysis:

Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green (bluf duplicates the preceding word's color, which is green for ""dax"")
Input: dax bluf wif zup -> Output: green green red yellow (bluf duplicates the color of ""dax"", which is green, and then ""wif"" follows with red, and zup with yellow)
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red (bluf duplicates the preceding word's color, which is red for ""wif"")
Input: wif dax bluf -> Output: red green green (bluf duplicates the color of ""dax"", which is green)
Input: wif bluf dax -> Output: red red green (bluf duplicates the color of ""wif"", which is red, and then ""dax"" follows with green)

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the preceding word. Thus, if the word before ""bluf"" is associated with the color green, ""bluf"" means green, and if the word before ""bluf"" is associated with the color red, ""bluf"" means red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the pattern of colors associated with each word across the examples.

- Every time ""walm"" is mentioned, multiple ""red"" outputs follow it in each respective sequence.
- The number of ""red"" outputs following ""walm"" corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears.
- The relationship of ""walm"" to other words isn't apparently affecting its output; the output purely depends on its frequency in the sequence.

Now, let's confirm the hypothesis by examining the examples:

Example 1:
- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
- Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
""Walm"" appears twice; hence, there are two groups of ""red"" following each occurrence.

Example 2:
- Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
- Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
""Walm"" appears once, and there's a ""red"" output immediately following it.

Example 3:
- Input: zup lug walm wif walm
- Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
""Walm"" appears twice; thus, there are two groups of ""red"" (one red per ""walm"") after each occurrence, followed by other colors associated with the other words.

Example 4:
- Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
- Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
""Walm"" appears once, followed by a sequence of ""red"" output.

Example 5:
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
- Output: yellow red green green green blue
""Walm"" appears once, and it is followed by multiple ""green"" outputs this time, which contradicts our idea that it results in a series of red.

Upon reviewing all examples, it seems that initially, ""walm"" seemed to produce a series of ""red"" following its appearance. However, the last example showed that it resulted in ""green"" output. It's important to note that in example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" which has consistently been associated with the color ""blue."" 

Given that the rule isn't absolute with the presence of an outlier in the pattern, our rule for ""walm"" considering all examples should incorporate the anomaly. Keeping all observations in mind, we can deduce the following rule is most consistent with the examples given:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> causes the next word to repeat its output color multiple times. The number of repetitions equals the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively. If ""walm"" does not appear consecutively, the effect is negated by an intervening word, as seen in Example 1, where ""lug"" interrupts the consecutive ""walm"" occurrence, changing the output; in Example 5, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output is blue instead of the expected multiple reds.

Therefore, the final rule deduced is not completely consistent due to the anomaly in the last example. Further examples would be needed to refine the rule for ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sentence, ""lug"" is always translated to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" seems consistent across all examples provided. Every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence or the other words around it. 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that precedes it. Here's the reasoning:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow (which is the color associated with ""zup"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is green (which is the color associated with ""dax"").
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red (which is the color associated with ""wif"").

In cases where ""bluf"" stands alone after ""wif"" or ""zup,"" it simply repeats the color associated with the preceding word. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" can be framed as follows:

Rule: 
bluf -> The color of ""bluf"" is the color associated with the word that precedes ""bluf."" If ""bluf"" follows no other color-associated word, repeat the last mentioned color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we should focus on the elements that appear directly before or after it, and the output this word is mapped to. By looking at the examples, here's what we can infer:

- In the first input, ""wif walm,"" maps to ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could mean ""red.""
- In the second input, ""wif walm dax,"" ""walm"" is surrounded by ""wif"" and ""dax,"" and again, the corresponding output is ""red red red green."" The presence of ""walm"" did not influence the color associated with ""dax,"" which consistently maps to ""green.""
- The third input, ""dax lug wif walm,"" ends with ""walm,"" and the last two outputs are ""red red."" This supports the idea that ""walm"" could again mean ""red"" because it does not alter the output color for ""wif,"" which remains ""red.""
- Similarly, in the fourth input, ""dax walm wif,"" ""walm"" is placed between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" and the output is ""green green green red."" ""Walm"" here again seems associated with the color ""green,"" just like ""dax.""
- The last input, ""zup walm,"" maps to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is the same output for ""zup.""

The data suggests that ""walm"" is likely to be the same color as the word preceding it. However, in the absence of a preceding color word, it appears to default to ""red,"" as seen in the first and second examples. The only outlier seems to be the third input where ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" but this is likely due to the regular pattern of ""wif"" mapping to ""red.""

Rule: walm -> takes on the color value of the previous word; if no previous color word is present or if ""walm"" is the first word after ""wif,"" it defaults to ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other nonce words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" correlates consistently with the color ""green"" in the outputs. Every input that contains the word ""dax"" corresponds to an output that includes the color ""green,"" and the position of ""dax"" in the input matches the position of ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

dax -> green

Rule: When ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green
- ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" both times. 
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" both before and after ""zup.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as in the first input.
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" as before.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" on both sides.
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and precedes both ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"").

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule:
wif -> red

When ""wif"" is present in the input, it consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Observing the given examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. zup in the first position translates to yellow.
2. zup is followed by different words in each example (bluf, lug, wif, dax).
3. The output for zup is always yellow.

From these observations, it seems that ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to replicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three more times. Here is the breakdown:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.

Input: zup dax walm
Output: yellow green green green
""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, ""wif"" is associated with ""red"", and the following ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times.

""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""dax"" is associated with ""green"", and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word three additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: ""dax"" means ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs is replaced with ""red"" in the outputs, regardless of position or surrounding words. Thus, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the word ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can determine a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" by analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: dax walm zup walm
Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Input: zup
Output: yellow

From these examples, we can deduce the following pattern:
- When ""zup"" follows the word ""walm,"" the output is a sequence of yellows equal in number to the total occurrences of the word ""walm.""
- When ""zup"" precedes the word ""wif,"" the output starts with yellow and is followed by red, regardless of how many times ""wif"" occurs (it only occurs once in the given examples).
- When ""zup"" is present without a following word, the output is a single yellow.

This suggests that ""zup"" is tied to the output color yellow, but it seems to also be influenced by its position relative to other words in the input.

Rule: zup, when used in an input, results in an initial output of yellow. The number of yellow outputs after ""zup"" depends on the number of times the next word appears in the sequence. If there is no word after ""zup,"" the output is a single yellow. If ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" there will be as many yellows as the total occurrences of ""walm"" in the input. If it is followed by ""wif,"" it precedes a red no matter the number of ""wif"" occurring after it.

Hence, the rule for ""zup"" could be formulated as:
zup -> Yellow, followed by a sequence determined by the subsequent word (""walm"" or ""wif"").
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following about the word ""bluf"":

1. In the first example ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green"". Since ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""bluf"" would be equivalent to ""yellow"".
   
2. In the second example ""zup lug zup bluf lug"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow blue"". Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". This supports the idea that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" because it takes the place of ""zup"".

3. In the third example ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"". Here, ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow"". The word ""wif"" is different from ""bluf"" and translates to ""red"". This also suggests ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"".

4. In the fourth example ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"". In this case, ""wif"" is ""red"", ""zup"" is ""yellow"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". Since ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"" and translates to ""red"", we might assume that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it, which is ""red"" in this instance from ""wif"".

5. In the fifth example, ""lug dax bluf"" translates to ""blue green green"". With ""lug"" as ""blue"" and ""dax"" as ""green"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green"".

Considering the above examples, we can discern a pattern that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it. If this rule is correct, then in situations where ""bluf"" follows:

- ""zup"", it translates to ""yellow"",
- ""lug"", it translates to ""blue"",
- ""dax"", it translates to ""green"",
- ""wif"", it translates to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately before it.
To figure out the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the specifics of the inputs and the corresponding outputs.

Firstly, notice that every time ""walm"" is present, the output is not a single color but a sequence of colors. Also, the appearance of ""walm"" seems to yield a repeated color pattern. In most cases, the repeat pattern ends with the color blue. Let's use this information to analyze each input:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
   Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" appears twice.
   - ""wif"" is translated to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""
   - After the first ""walm,"" the colors are ""red green yellow red blue.""
   - After the second ""walm,"" the colors are ""blue blue blue.""

2. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" appears once at the end.
   - The colors following ""walm"" are “blue blue blue.”

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" appears once at the end.
   - The colors following ""walm"" are ""yellow yellow yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""walm"" appears once.
   - The colors following ""walm"" are ""yellow yellow yellow.""

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""walm"" appears once after ""wif.""
   - There is no sequence following the first ""walm.""

From these observations, we can try to induce some rules:

- Each instance of ""walm"" requires a repeat in color sequence in the output.
- The repeated color sequence ends with the color blue except in the case when ""walm"" is the last word.
- When ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the word just before.

By examining the examples and focusing on the colors that are repeated and those that come after ""walm,"" we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the previous word's color to be repeated until the sequence concludes with the color blue, or the input sequence ends.

With this in mind, let's provide the meaning for ""walm"":

walm -> Repeat the previous color until the sequence includes blue or the input ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" seems to dictate a pattern in which the color that follows ""dax"" sets a repeating color pattern for each subsequent word. Let's analyze how ""dax"" functions in each example:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  Rule: ""dax"" sets the color green. ""wif"" changes color to red, repeating for each word until ""zup"" changes it to blue. ""walm"" then changes the color to yellow, repeating for each subsequent word.

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Rule: ""dax"" sets the color green, and ""walm"" maintains the color green, repeating it for each instance of the word.

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  Rule: ""dax"" by itself corresponds to the color green.

- Input: dax lug wif
  Output: green blue red
  Rule: ""dax"" sets the color green, ""lug"" changes the color to blue, and ""wif"" changes it to red, with each word representing a single instance of the color.

- Input: dax zup wif bluf lug
  Output: green yellow red red blue
  Rule: ""dax"" sets the color green, ""zup"" changes it to yellow, ""wif"" changes it to red and repeats for ""bluf"" (since we previously saw that ""wif"" maintains the color red), and finally ""lug"" changes it to blue.

General Rule:
dax -> sets the initial color to green, and then each subsequent unique word changes the color. The same color continues until a new unique word is encountered, which triggers a change in color.

Rule: Dax sets the initial color to green. Each word after ""dax"" changes the pattern of the output colors. If the word repeats, the same color repeats for each instance. Each unique word changes the current color to a new one, corresponding to an apparently predetermined sequence (green, red, blue, yellow, etc.).
Based on the given examples, it appears that 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Each instance of 'wif' in the input results in 'red' in the output. Here’s the breakdown:

- Input: dax bluf wif lug
  Output: green green red blue
  Here, 'wif' follows 'bluf' and precedes 'lug', linking it to 'red'.

- Input: lug dax wif
  Output: blue green red
  'wif' is at the end of the sequence, and 'red' follows the corresponding 'green' for 'dax'.

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
  Output: blue red blue green green
  'wif' is sandwiched between two 'lug' which correspond to 'blue', and in this position, 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

- Input: dax wif zup
  Output: green red yellow
  Between 'dax' (green) and 'zup' (yellow), 'wif' is consistently 'red'.

- Input: wif zup
  Output: red yellow
  Without any other context except for following 'zup', 'wif' stands for 'red'.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to examine each example provided and identify the consistent pattern that applies to the occurrence of ""zup"" and its corresponding color output:

1. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"" and the corresponding color for ""zup"" is yellow. The color for ""lug"" is blue, so it appears that ""zup"" does not directly translate to ""blue.""

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" and both ""zup"" and ""bluf"" output is yellow. This seems to imply that ""zup"" has a consistent yellow output regardless of the word that follows.

3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
   - Again, ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"" with the output yellow for both. The rest of the sequence seems to conform to the previously seen pattern, with new colors corresponding to specific words (presence of another red confirms ""wif,"" blue confirms ""lug,"" green confirms ""dax"").

4. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" follows ""lug"" which has a consistent blue output, and ""zup"" has a yellow output as seen before.

5. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - Similar to the previous example, ""zup"" follows ""dax"" which has a consistent green output, and ""zup"" retains its yellow output.

Rule: In all presented cases, ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Thus, the meaning can be deduced as directly associated with the color yellow.

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow
Rule: bluf -> color of the word immediately preceding it in the input.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to find a pattern that can apply to all examples.

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- Except for the presence of ""walm,"" the words zup, dax, lug, and wif correspond to yellow, green, blue, and red.

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- Here, ""wif"" results in red, and ""dax"" and ""zup"" lead to green and yellow, as before.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" consistently corresponds to yellow, and with ""walm"" following it, the output is again yellow.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
- ""Zup"" results in yellow, ""wif"" in red, and followed by ""walm,"" the output is red.

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to yellow as well, and ""lug"" to blue. However, following this, ""zup"" still gives yellow, but with ""walm"" at the end, all outputs become yellow.

From these examples, we can observe that whenever ""walm"" is present, the color that follows it in the output sequence is the same as the color immediately before ""walm"" was mentioned.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" would be that whatever color a word represents right before ""walm,"" all subsequent color representations until a new color word appears are replaced with that color. If no new color word appears after ""walm,"" the last mentioned color continues.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color name that comes before ""walm"" until a different color word appears. If no new color word appears, continue with the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax
    ",Output: red yellow green,red yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""dax,"" we need to carefully examine each of the given input-output pairs to see how the position and context of ""dax"" correlates with the rest of the words and their outputs.

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red

Input: lug dax lug wif
Output: blue green blue red

Input: lug dax zup
Output: blue green yellow

Input: lug dax wif
Output: blue green red

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue

Let's examine how ""dax"" interacts with other words. Looking at the third example, ""lug dax zup,"" which translates to ""blue green yellow,"" we see that when ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" it translates to ""green."" This same pattern is seen when ""lug"" follows ""dax""—the translation is ""green blue"" for ""dax lug.""

In the second example, ""lug dax lug wif,"" it translates to ""blue green blue red."" ""Dax"" is again associated with ""green,"" which seems to confirm our initial observation that ""dax"" translates to ""green.""

In the first example, ""dax zup walm wif walm,"" we see that ""dax"" leads to ""green,"" with the subsequent words yielding ""yellow yellow yellow red red red,"" where each word seems to be translated consistently based on its repetition.

The consistent translation of ""dax"" to ""green"" in all examples regardless of its position suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green"" without dependence on context. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" is not dependent on the context within the given examples.

Rule: dax -> green.
Given the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
2. The position of ""wif"" does not appear to affect the meaning of the other words; ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" consistently. ""bluf"" has appeared twice corresponding to ""yellow"" each time.

Given this information, we can deduce the rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context.
bluf -> the color that the word representing it translates to. Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color of the word that comes immediately before it. 

For example:
- In ""wif zup bluf,"" ""zup"" is yellow, and ""bluf"" becomes yellow.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" is red, and ""bluf"" becomes red.
- In ""lug bluf,"" ""lug"" is blue, and ""bluf"" becomes blue.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce that ""walm"" causes the color that follows it to repeat thrice. To verify this, let's look at each example:

- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
  Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
  Explanation: ""wif"" is red, and after ""walm,"" ""red"" is repeated thrice.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Explanation: ""zup"" is yellow, and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

- Input: lug walm dax
  Output: blue blue blue green
  Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated thrice followed by ""dax"" which is green.

- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue
  Explanation: ""lug"" is blue, and after ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated thrice.

- Input: dax walm wif dax
  Output: green green green red green
  Explanation: ""dax"" is green, and after ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice followed by ""wif"" which is red and another ""dax"" which is green.

Each of these examples supports the rule that ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the next color mentioned to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color blue consistently in every example.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red."" The other words in the inputs correspond to their respective colors, and their outputs are consistent throughout the examples. ""Dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Therefore, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the other words present. Here's the observed correlation:

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
(One ""yellow"" corresponds directly to ""zup,"" the meaning of ""walm"" is unknown but might correspond to two instances of ""yellow."")

Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
(One ""yellow"" corresponds directly to ""zup,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."")

Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
(One ""yellow"" corresponds directly to ""zup,"" while ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow."")

Input: zup -> Output: yellow
(""Zup"" on its own corresponds to a single ""yellow."")

Input: wif lug zup bluf -> Output: red blue yellow yellow
(""Zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" The word ""bluf"" can be deduced to mean ""yellow"")

Rule: zup corresponds to the word ""yellow."" Therefore: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, each input word appears to map to a specific color output word. The consistent pattern is that every time the nonce word ""bluf"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red."" Therefore, we can deduce the following:

bluf -> ""red""

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the supplied examples, we can infer a rule for what ""walm"" stands for by looking at the output colors that correspond to its position:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce the same color output - red.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- ""dax"" and ""walm"" produce the same color output - green.

Input: lug walm wif zup wif
Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
- ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""wif"" all produce the same color output when they are adjacent - blue.

Input: lug wif walm
Output: blue red red red
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce the same output color when they are adjacent - red.

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red
- ""wif"" and ""walm"" produce the same output color - red.

Rule:
From the above examples, it is clear that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. If it is the first word, the following word does not impact its color, as seen in the last example where ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red"" rather than ""red red red red."" Thus, ""walm"" seems to replicate the color of the preceding word or maintains a predetermined color (red) when at the beginning.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: ""walm"" causes the output to be the same color as the preceding word's output; if ""walm"" is the first word, the color is red by default.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's look at the patterns related to its occurrence.

In every example where ""dax"" occurs, the output always includes ""green."" Specifically, ""green"" appears immediately following the position where ""dax"" appears in the input. This suggests that ""dax"" translates directly to ""green.""

Let's confirm this with each example:

1. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   ""Dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color.

2. Input: dax lug zup -> Output: green blue yellow
   ""Dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
   ""Dax"" is the third word, and correspondingly, ""green"" is the third color.

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif -> Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   ""Dax"" occurs as the third word, and ""green"" is the third color in the output.

5. Input: dax lug bluf wif -> Output: green blue blue red
   ""Dax"" is the first word, and ""green"" is the first color in the output.

Based on these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the word ""green,"" and it always results in ""green"" appearing in the output at the position corresponding to where ""dax"" appears in the input.

Therefore:

dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time the word ""wif"" is present in an input, the output features the color ""red"" at the corresponding position. Additionally, the presence of other words such as ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""walm,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to other colors like ""green,"" ""blue,"" ""blue,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

Input: zup wif walm lug  
Output: yellow red red red blue  
Here, zup correlates to yellow, wif correlates to red, walm correlates to red, and lug correlates to blue.

Input: lug dax zup  
Output: blue green yellow  
Here, lug correlates to blue, dax correlates to green, and zup correlates to yellow.

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif  
Output: blue green yellow green green green red  
Again, lug correlates to blue, dax to green, zup to yellow, walm to green, and wif to red.

Input: lug zup  
Output: blue yellow  
Here, lug correlates to blue, and zup correlates to yellow.

Input: zup  
Output: yellow  
Here, zup is alone and correlates to yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Examining the examples given, we can infer a rule about the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"". The rule seems to be based on the output color corresponding to the position of ""bluf"" in the input sequence:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is red.
2. When ""bluf"" follows any other word (e.g., ""lug"" or ""dax""), the output is blue.
3. When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup"" or followed by ""wif"" (but not both), the output is yellow.
4. When ""bluf"" stands alone with ""zup"", the output is consistently yellow.

Considering these observations, the rule could be summarized as follows: ""bluf"" represents a color that is dependent on the context, particularly the word that comes before it. If ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" or stands alone with ""zup"", the color is yellow. In all other contexts, it results in blue.

Rule: bluf -> yellow when followed by ""wif"" or alone with ""zup,"" otherwise blue.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let us analyze the input and output patterns presented in the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
   - The presence of ""walm"" after ""dax"" also corresponds to ""green""
   - ""wif"" following ""walm"" changes the output to ""red""

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is still ""yellow""
   - When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" ""lug,"" or appears after such words, the color does not change

3. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - After the initial ""dax,"" ""walm"" repetition does not alter the ""green"" output, suggesting ""walm"" may maintain the current color
   - However, when ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it results in ""red,"" and the subsequent ""walm"" maintains the ""red"" output

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""bluf"" seems to cause the color to remain ""red"" after ""walm wif,"" suggesting that ""walm"" might be keeping or repeating the color of the previous word before it

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" maintains the ""red"" output before changing to ""green"" with ""dax""

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" seems to act as a repeater or sustainer of the output color of the preceding word. If a new word with a different corresponding color follows ""walm,"" the color changes to that new corresponding color, indicating that ""walm"" does not impose a color but rather continues the one in effect until a change is induced by the sequence.

Rule: walm -> maintains the current color output of the preceding word

This suggests that ""walm"" has a meaning or function akin to continuation or sustaining what came before it. It does not have an intrinsic color value assigned but influences the output based on its position and the context provided by surrounding words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context in which it appears.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" appears to be associated with the color green each time it is used. Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be quite simple:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means the color green.
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"". Here's the evidence supporting this conclusion:

- In each of the examples, regardless of the context or the position of ""wif"" in the sequence, the output consistently translates ""wif"" as ""red"".

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow."" Each instance of ""zup"" in the input yields ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or surrounding words (which have their own corresponding colors).

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the Output.

Here's how the rule can be drawn from the examples:

1. Input: dax bluf wif lug
   Output: green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to red here since the only difference from the other colors is ""bluf"" being the second word.

2. Input: wif bluf lug
   Output: red red blue
   - Again, ""bluf"" corresponds to red as it is the only unknown and the only red in the output.

3. Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug
   Output: blue red green green red blue
   - ""bluf"" corresponds to red, following the established pattern.

4. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   - ""bluf"" follows as red in the sequence based on the previous rule.

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow
   - ""bluf"" is red, consistent with the previous examples.

Rule:
bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples and find patterns:

Example 1:
Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

Example 2:
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Example 3:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Example 4:
Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Example 5:
Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

Based on the given examples, we can observe that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, it produces an output of ""red"" that repeats based on the following pattern:

- For each instance of ""walm,"" the output is ""red"" repeated a number of times equal to the count of ""wif"" that occur before the next ""dax"" after ""walm"" or until the end of the input if ""dax"" does not follow.

To clarify:
- In Example 1, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"" without a ""dax,"" so the repetition of ""red"" to the end gives us ""green green green"" since ""wif"" appeared once before ""walm.""
- In Example 2, there is no ""dax"" after ""walm"" again, and ""wif"" appeared once before ""walm,"" so the output is ""red red red.""
- In Example 3, ""wif"" appears once before the first ""dax"" after ""walm,"" so ""red"" is repeated once resulting in ""blue.""
- In Example 4, ""wif"" appears once and there's no following ""dax,"" so we get three repetitions of ""red.""
- In Example 5, ""wif"" appears twice before ""walm"" without a following ""dax,"" so ""red"" is repeated twice, hence ""red red red.""

Rule: walm -> repeat ""red"" for as many times as ""wif"" appears before the next ""dax"" after ""walm"" or until the end of the input if no ""dax"" follows.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> ""blue""

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is included in the output. The number of times ""lug"" appears is the number of times ""blue"" appears consecutively. For instance, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" is not directly translated but influences the repetition of ""blue"". The rest of the words (e.g., ""dax,"" ""zup"") relate to their respective colors, being ""green"" and ""yellow"", independently of the presence of ""lug"".
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the sequence of words.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence. There is no contextual dependency that alters its meaning, so we can deduce that ""zup"" simply means ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To determine the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's observe patterns in each input-output pair.

1. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red"". Since we only see ""bluf"" once, there's not enough information to deduce the exact meaning. We need more examples.

2. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""bluf"" appears twice, and each time it is followed by a repetition of the previous color. So, ""bluf"" may be indicating a repeat of the preceding color.

3. Input: dax lug bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue green

   Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and results in a repetition of ""blue"". This supports the repetition rule from the second example.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

   Each noun corresponds to a color (e.g., ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue""), and each ""bluf"" causes a repetition of the color that precedes it.

5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red

   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""wif"" to red, and again ""bluf"" results in the red being repeated.

From these examples, it appears that ""bluf"" indicates the repetition of the color that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the preceding color.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze each input alongside its corresponding output, focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and the patterning of the output:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   - ""wif"" corresponds to a single ""red"" followed by ""walm"" and two additional ""red"".

2. Input: dax lug dax lug walm
   Output: green blue green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". After ""walm,"" the ""blue"" color is repeated.

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""wif"" to ""red"". After ""walm,"" the ""red"" color is repeated like in example 1.

4. Input: wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   - The colors ""red"", ""green"", and ""yellow"" are represented, in order, by ""wif"", ""dax"", and ""zup"". After ""walm,"" the ""yellow"" is repeated multiple times.

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to a single ""blue"" followed by ""walm"" and two additional ""blue"".

By observing the pattern, it seems that ""walm"" causes the color word immediately preceding it to be repeated two times. Therefore, ""walm"" functions as a rule indicating that the last color mentioned should be repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last color word mentioned two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow yellow yellow,green yellow yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue regardless of its position in the sequence or the context.
Based on the given examples, the rule for what ""dax"" means is consistent across all instances:

- In all cases where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""

Therefore, ""dax"" correlates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. The rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" To confirm this, let's take a closer look at the inputs and outputs:

- In every instance where ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The position of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the position of ""red"" in the output.
- ""Wif"" as an individual input results in ""red"" as the sole output.

Now let's write down the rule:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Given the examples, it is consistently observable that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. There doesn't seem to be a variation in the output based on the context surrounding ""zup"" in these examples. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" in these examples is the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Based on the provided data, there appears to be a pattern between the input word ""walm"" and the corresponding output. The word ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of the color word preceding it in the output sequence. To formulate a more precise rule, let's look at each example:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" and ""walm"" seems to triple the occurrence.

2. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and has the color ""green"" associated with it, but the color output that follows ""walm"" is ""yellow"" in triplicate. This suggests that the color that is tripled is not the one directly associated with ""dax,"" but rather the one associated with ""zup,"" which follows ""dax.""

3. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - Here, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and has the color ""red"" associated with it, which is then repeated thrice.

4. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - Both ""dax"" and ""wif"" are followed by ""walm,"" and each time ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times—first ""green,"" then ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times after it again.

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it causes the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it to be repeated three times in the output.

Therefore, we can deduce that:

walm -> The rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color output of the word preceding ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its placement in the input sequence.
Based on the examples given:

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red 
Input: zup dax walm zup wif -> Output: yellow green green green yellow red
Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
Input: zup wif zup -> Output: yellow red yellow

From the repeated patterns, we can see that ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the other words (nonce or real) around it. 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be formulated as:
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every instance it appears.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" Therefore:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can observe the output colors corresponding to each input, which includes the nonce word ""walm."" To deduce the meaning or rule for ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the output colors for each given example.

1. ""wif lug walm"" -> Output: red blue blue blue 
   The word ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and all instances beyond ""walm"" are ""blue.""

2. ""lug walm wif"" -> Output: blue blue blue red
   After ""walm,"" there is a ""wif"" which results in ""red,"" but the instances of ""blue"" before ""wif"" include ""walm.""

3. ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" -> Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   ""Walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow."" However, ""zup"" alone sometimes results in ""yellow"" (for example, before ""wif"" at the end). ""Walm"" itself is followed by three ""blue.""

4. ""dax lug wif walm"" -> Output: green blue red red red
   After ""walm,"" each term in the sequence is ""red.""

5. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   Following ""walm,"" all instances are ""yellow,"" even though ""walm"" is preceded by other words with different assigned colors.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it makes all the following terms have the same color unless a new word appears that changes the sequence color (like ""wif"" resulting in ""red""). The color that ""walm"" starts could be potentially given by the word right in front of it or the standing sequence color pattern at the point where ""walm"" appears.

With the examples given, a clear single color or standalone meaning for ""walm"" cannot be deduced. Still, we can summarize the observed effect of ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is introduced in a sequence, it changes the color of the following terms to be the same until a new term appears that has a definitive color change effect.

So, in the context of these examples:

walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a rule that makes succeeding terms match the color of the term preceding ""walm"" or continue the same color until a new color-influencing term appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Regardless of the context or the surrounding words, whenever the nonce word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
From the examples, we can induce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" by comparing inputs to their corresponding outputs.

1. Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
2. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
3. Input: zup lug walm wif dax -> Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
4. Input: wif dax -> Output: red green
5. Input: dax bluf -> Output: green green

We can deduce that the word ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" based on their consistent translations across different examples. Additionally, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to ""green"" as seen in example 5.

Notably, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each input word is translated into a specific color in the output, and ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow."" Thus, it can be inferred that ""zup"" correlates directly with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of the presence of other words such as ""dax"" or ""bluf,"" which correspond to other colors.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze its relationship with the other words in the inputs and their corresponding colors in the outputs. Let's consider each example individually and look for patterns:

1. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   - The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red."" ""Bluf"" is followed by ""yellow"" in the output, but since ""zup"" also gives ""yellow,"" it's not conclusive.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" once again, and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Wif"" still corresponds to ""red."" This time ""bluf"" corresponds to the sequence ""red red"" in the output, but ""wif"" already corresponds to ""red,"" and we also have a new word ""walm"" that doesn't have a clear match.

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   - ""Wif"" is ""red,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue."" ""Bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" here and follows ""zup,"" which might indicate it's a color repeater related to the color that precedes it.

4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   - ""Wif"" gives ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" reaffirming the idea that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

5. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - Here ""lug"" gives ""blue,"" ""zup"" gives ""yellow,"" ""dax"" gives ""green,"" and ""bluf"" once again corresponds to a repeated ""yellow"" after ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the patterns and the positions where the word occurs in the given examples. Let's examine each input and its corresponding output to find any consistent pattern associated with the word ""walm.""

1. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red

In this example, ""walm"" occurs just before ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue. However, the direct output of ""walm"" here is red.

2. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" again, but its direct output is yellow.

3. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

""walm"" follows 'dax', which corresponds to green, and ""walm"" itself also translates to green.

4. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and outputs blue. However, ""lug"" typically corresponds to blue itself.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

Again, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in blue, followed by ""dax,"" which is green.

After examining the inputs and outputs, the word ""walm"" doesn't consistently translate to any single color. It seems to be context-dependent. Nonetheless, there is a pattern that emerges with its relation to the colors that follow it. In most cases, ""walm"" causes the next color to repeat itself. To clarify:

- In the first example, ""walm"" precedes ""lug,"" and we get an output of ""blue"" for ""lug,"" followed by another ""red,"" indicating a repetition since the previous color before ""walm"" was ""red.""
- In the second example, ""lug"" repeats as ""blue"" after ""walm.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" following ""walm"" repeats as ""green.""
- In the fourth example, after ""walm,"" ""dax"" repeats as ""green"" following it.
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" follows ""walm"" and is repeated twice in output as ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule regarding ""walm"" seems to be that the output color immediately following ""walm"" will repeat the output color of the word that precedes ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> The following color repeats the prior color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow yellow,red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" let's analyze the given examples one by one, examining the output's patterns in response to the input, and particularly focusing on the word ""dax.""

- From the first input, we see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
- In the second input, ""dax"" also leads to ""green.""
- In the third input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" when it appears both before and after ""zup.""
- The fourth input also shows that ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- Similarly, in the fifth input, ""dax"" is again linked to ""green.""

Based on these observations, the repeated pattern is that whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to ""green"" in the output sequence.

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems like the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" consistently. Each occurrence of ""wif"" results in the word ""red"" in the output, irrespective of the position or the surrounding words.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns regarding its use and corresponding output in the examples provided.

Let's examine each case:

1. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   In this instance, ""wif"" and ""bluf"" again both correspond to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" corresponds to ""green green green.""

3. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow."" However, the duplication of ""yellow"" makes it uncertain if ""bluf"" actually means ""yellow"" or ""duplicate the color that comes before it.""

4. Input: lug bluf zup lug
   Output: blue blue yellow blue
   In this example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" again to ""blue."" It's consistent with ""bluf"" meaning either ""blue"" or ""the same color as the previous word.""

5. Input: wif lug bluf wif zup
   Output: red blue blue red yellow
   ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" to ""blue,"" ""wif"" again to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" ""Bluf"" once again either means ""blue"" or ""repeat the previous color.""

Summarizing these observations, it seems that the meaning of ""bluf"" either corresponds to ""blue"" or it implies ""the same color as the previous word."" However, there are no instances where ""bluf"" is followed by a color other than ""blue"" to firmly establish that it means ""repeat the previous color."" Every incidence of ""bluf"" corresponds directly to ""red"" when it follows ""wif,"" or ""blue"" when it follows ""lug,"" ""zup,"" or stands alone. Since ""bluf"" itself translates to ""blue"" in Dutch (a real-world language), there may be a bias toward interpreting ""bluf"" as ""blue."" 

However, given the information presented, the more consistent rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it. If there's no word before it, default to ""blue.""
From the examples provided, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" functions as a repetitive operator that extends and propagates the color of the word immediately preceding it, until a different unique word is encountered.

Let's break down the examples to understand how ""walm"" operates:

1. Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red
Explanation: ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it extends the blue. ""Wif"" is a new word that changes the color to red.

2. Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red."" The ""walm"" extends the red until ""dax,"" which changes the color to green.

3. Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
Explanation: ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" but since it is followed by ""lug"" which translates to ""blue,"" ""walm"" extends the ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green
Explanation: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" extends the green. ""wif"" changes to red, ""lug"" changes to blue, followed by another ""dax"" which is green, and ""walm"" extends that green until the end.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red
Explanation: ""dax"" is green, ""walm"" extends the green. ""wif"" changes to red, and ""walm"" further extends the red.

Rule:
walm -> Extends the color of the preceding word until a new unique word provides a different color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm
    ",Output: red red red,red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the outputs.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" is used in the input, the output includes the color ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. Here are the observations that support this:

- ""wif zup"" outputs ""red yellow""
- Both instances of ""zup"" in ""zup dax zup lug"" correspond to ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""dax zup"" outputs ""green yellow""
- The single instance of ""zup"" in the input ""dax lug zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
- The input ""lug wif dax zup walm"" includes ""zup"" once and the output includes ""yellow"" in the corresponding position, with ""walm"" apparently repeating the last color mentioned, as seen by the double ""yellow"" following it.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that correspond with the appearance of ""bluf"".

Input: zup wif bluf zup
Output: yellow red red yellow

Input: zup bluf wif
Output: yellow yellow red

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

Input: wif lug bluf
Output: red blue blue

From the first example, we see that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". The first and last word/color match, which suggests positional consistency for some words.

The second example confirms that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and further shows that an input of ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another ""yellow"", which could imply that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word directly before it when following ""zup"".

The third example is more complex, but we can see that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". When ""bluf"" comes after ""dax"", it does not result in ""green"" but instead leads to ""red"". Here, ""bluf"" does not take the color of the word before it. Moreover, ""wif"" follows ""bluf wif"", suggesting that ""bluf"" might reset to the color associated with ""wif"" when preceded by it.

The fourth and fifth examples further reinforce this pattern: when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""wif"" respectively, it seems to take on the color of the word before it.

Considering these observations, we can induce the following rule:
bluf -> takes the color of the word directly before it.

So the induced rule is:
bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it three times. Here is the breakdown of the pattern observed:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, and the output following ""walm"" is ""green green green"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and the output following ""walm"" is ""red red red"".
- In the third and fourth examples, we see that ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to yellow and green respectively, with ""walm"" causing the repetition of these colors three times in the output.
- The fifth example shows that ""walm"" following ""wif"" similarly causes the color red to repeat three times.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the preceding word to be repeated three times in the sequence.

So, walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is a command that repeats the color of the preceding word thrice.

Rule: walm -> repeat the preceding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Explanation: In every example given, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output consistently includes the color ""blue."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" let's analyze the correspondence between the input and the output in the provided examples:

1. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
  
2. Input: lug zup dax wif
   Output: blue yellow green red

3. Input: zup dax walm lug wif
   Output: yellow green green green blue red

4. Input: zup wif zup
   Output: yellow red yellow

5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

By examining the patterns, we can make the following observations:
- In examples 1 and 5, ""wif"" appears before ""bluf,"" and the corresponding output for ""bluf"" is ""red."" However, the presence of ""wif"" does not change the output for ""bluf,"" which suggests ""wif"" does not modify the color associated with ""bluf.""
- In all examples where ""wif"" is followed by a different word, the output color for ""wif"" is ""red.""
- The word following ""wif"" does not receive a specific, unique color that is consistent across the examples, indicating that ""wif"" does not determine the color of the subsequent word.
- ""Wif"" does not appear alone without another word following it. Thus, we do not have an example of what color ""wif"" would correspond to if it were the only word in the input.

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the words that follow it. A rule that fits the examples might be:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each instance of the word ""zup"" in the input is translated to ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples provided, we see that ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"" each time it is preceded by ""zup."" However, when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it results in ""green"" or ""red"" respectively. 

Therefore, we can deduce:

When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow.""
When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" it translates to ""green.""
When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""

A single instance of ""bluf"" following ""lug"" does not provide sufficient data to establish a rule.

Given these observations, we cannot deduce a single meaning for the nonce word ""bluf"" because its output changes based on the preceding word. Instead, we can conclude that ""bluf"" is a placeholder whose meaning changes with context.

Rule: bluf -> The meaning of ""bluf"" is dependent on the preceding word, taking the color associated with that word based on provided patterns (""zup"" -> ""yellow,"" ""dax"" -> ""green,"" ""wif"" -> ""red"").
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's analyze the color patterns associated with the word ""walm"" and its surrounding context in each of the input/output pairs:

1. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""Walm"" here is associated with the output ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm zup walm
   Output: green green green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""Walm"" is again associated with the color that came before it, which in this case is ""green.""

3. Input: lug walm wif lug
   Output: blue blue blue red blue
   - Here, ""walm"" also follows the color pattern established by ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Walm"" takes the color ""green,"" which is associated with ""dax.""

5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""Walm"" once again takes the color ""green,"" following ""dax.""

From the given examples, ""walm"" seems to take the color of the word that comes immediately before it. If there is no word before ""walm,"" as seen in certain cases, it might take a default or context-specific color.

Rule: walm -> Takes the color of the preceding word or a default if there's no preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently results in the output ""green,"" regardless of the context or surrounding words. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the presence of ""dax"" and the color ""green"" being produced. Other words (e.g., lug, walm, wif) have a one-to-one correspondence with other colors (""lug"" with ""blue"" and ""wif"" with ""red""). Therefore, we can deduce the meaning or the rule:

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of ""wif,"" let us examine the color pattern outputs relative to the position of ""wif"" and other words in the inputs.

1. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when repeated, maintains ""green.""
   
2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""
   ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow.""
   ""walm"" corresponds to ""yellow"" (however, note this is a change from ""green"" above, suggesting ""walm"" might change based on position or surrounding words).
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and when ""walm"" is repeated after it, it changes to ""red.""

3. Input: wif zup dax
   Output: red yellow green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

4. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax
   Output: red red green
   ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
   ""bluf"" is new but corresponds to ""red.""
   ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green.""

Based on the evidence, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that regardless of its position, it corresponds to the color ""red."" Additionally, it may influence following words to also correspond to ""red,"" as seen in example 2, but there is not enough data to conclude this for sure.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, my task is to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by looking at the relationship between the input and output sequences.

In all the examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output:

- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
  Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
               (The last ""yellow"" corresponds to ""bluf"")

- Input: zup bluf wif walm
  Output: yellow yellow red red red
                     (The second ""yellow"" corresponds to ""bluf"")

- Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
  Output: red red blue green red
                (The second ""red"" corresponds to ""bluf"")

- Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
  Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
                                  (The second ""yellow"" corresponds to ""bluf"")

- Input: wif lug bluf zup bluf dax
  Output: red blue blue yellow yellow green
                     (The third ""blue"" corresponds to ""bluf"")

However, in the last example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"" rather than ""yellow."" This discrepancy suggests that the meaning of ""bluf"" may change depending on the context.

Looking closely, it seems that the word ""bluf"" adopts the color of the word preceding it:
- ""zup bluf"" -> yellow yellow
- ""wif bluf"" -> red red
- ""lug bluf"" -> blue blue

Following this rule, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word immediately before it. However, this does not account for the last example, where ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" (green) and yet it is translated as ""yellow.""

With this conflicting result, we can infer that there may be an error in the last example, or that ""bluf"" follows a different rule when it occurs more than once in a sequence or is at the end of a sequence.

Without additional consistent data, the tentative rule would be:
bluf -> Takes on the color of the word immediately before it, but this rule may have exceptions or additional context-dependent variations not apparent from the given examples.

Final tentative rule:
bluf -> meaning. ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" but may adopt the color of the preceding word or have complex context-dependent meanings. Further examples are required to refine this rule.
walm -> meaning. The meaning based on the examples provided seems to be repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: When 'walm' appears after a color word (e.g., 'wif', 'lug', 'zup'), the output repeats the color associated with that word. In the provided examples, 'wif' corresponds to red, 'lug' to blue, and 'zup' to yellow. Thus, 'walm' causes these colors to be repeated in the output three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
The rule underlying the problem can be deduced by comparing the inputs and corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax walm wif lug dax walm"" outputs ""green green green red blue green green green."" The double occurrence of ""dax walm"" both times yields green green green, indicating that ""dax walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green.""

2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" outputs ""yellow red green green green blue."" Here ""dax walm"" again yields ""green green green."" 

3. ""zup bluf dax lug"" outputs ""yellow yellow green blue."" Here ""dax"" alone is followed by green.

4. ""dax walm zup lug"" outputs ""green green green yellow blue."" Again, ""dax"" is associated with green.

5. ""dax"" alone outputs green.

From these observations, we can induce that the rule for ""dax"" is that it consistently leads to the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red."" Every instance of ""wif"" in the input leads to the word ""red"" in the corresponding output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: zup -> Output: yellow
Input: wif zup dax -> Output: red yellow green
Input: zup dax walm -> Output: yellow green green green

It seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" There's no variation in the output regardless of the other words (lug, walm, wif, dax) surrounding ""zup"" in the examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
- Each time 'bluf' appears in the input, it corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the last color word mentioned. The number of repetitions appears to be the number of color words mentioned before ""walm"" plus one. Let's observe the patterns:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" two times (one for the number of color words mentioned before it (""lug""), plus one).

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   - Here, ""dax"" translates to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". ""walm"" repeats the last color word ""green"" three times (since two colors were mentioned before ""walm"", it adds one more).

3. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   - In this case, ""bluf"" translates to ""blue"" and ""wif"" to ""red"". ""walm"" repeats the last color word ""red"" three times (two ""red"" were mentioned before ""walm"", hence it repeats three times for a total of three reds).

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice (once for the ""lug"" before ""walm"", plus one more).

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last mentioned color word by the number of color words said before it plus one.

For example, if the sequence before ""walm"" was ""green blue"" (or ""dax lug""), ""walm"" would generate ""blue blue blue"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup walm dax lug
    ",Output: blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,blue yellow yellow yellow green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue."" There are no additional complexities or context rules indicated that alter the meaning of ""lug"" in different scenarios. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears the output colors are directly related to the input words. To determine the meaning of the word ""dax,"" let's look at the varying positions of ""dax"" and their consistent and inconsistent outcomes:

1. When ""dax"" appears at the start of the sequence, the output color is always green. 
2. When ""dax"" is not at the start, it replicates the color output of the first word in the sequence.

From the second example, we see ""dax"" appearing both at the start and later in the sequence:
- The first ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- The second ""dax"" also corresponds to green, but crucially, this is because the first word was ""dax.""

From the third example, ""dax"" appears at the end, after ""wif"", and corresponds to green, which aligns with the color of the first word of the sequence, ""zup"".

From the fourth example, ""dax"" comes after ""wif"" but the first word ""zup"" now corresponds to yellow, so ""dax"" changes to green, still aligning with the first word's color.

Therefore, the rule is:
- ""dax"" at the start of a sequence corresponds to green.
- ""dax"" later in the sequence corresponds to the color of the first word in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> Replicate the color associated with the first word in the sequence; if dax is the first word, the color is green.
wif -> meaning. Rule: wif translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> meaning. The word ""zup"" correlates with the output ""yellow"". 

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" is included the same number of times in the output.
bluf -> repeated color word that corresponds to the color denoted by the preceding word.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" is used after a color-indicating word, the output is the color word indicated by the previous word repeated two times.
Considering the given examples, let's look at the relationship between input strings and their corresponding output colors:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup | Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: lug walm | Output: blue blue blue
3. Input: lug zup walm lug | Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
5. Input: zup walm | Output: yellow yellow yellow

Let's analyze the patterns:

- The word ""wif"" in input always maps to ""red"" in output.
- The word ""lug"" in input always maps to ""blue"" in output.
- The word ""zup"" in input always maps to ""yellow"" in output.
- The word ""dax"" in input is associated with ""red"" and ""green"" - when it follows ""wif,"" it is ""red""; when it follows ""bluf,"" it is ""green.""

Now, let's focus on ""walm"":

- In every instance, the color that appears for ""walm"" is the same color that appears immediately before it.
- Furthermore, the sequence of colors corresponding to ""walm"" has the same number of colors repeated as the word preceding ""walm.""

From this, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word immediately before it, and the number of repetitions corresponds to the number of letters in the word that ""walm"" follows.

So for the output, we can deduce:

- ""wif walm"" -> ""red red red""
- ""lug walm"" -> ""blue blue blue""
- ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"" (note that ""walm"" here is following ""zup,"" which has 3 letters, hence three ""yellow"" colors before the final ""blue"" triggered by the last ""lug"")
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (""dax"" has 3 letters, so the output is three ""green"" colors after ""dax"")
- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

Using this rule induction, we can conclude:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the previous word, with the repetition count equal to the number of letters in that word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup wif dax
    ",Output: red yellow red green,red yellow red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""lug,"" let's analyze the inputs and outputs closely:

1. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow

3. Input: lug wif zup wif walm
   Output: blue red yellow red red red

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red

5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

From the first and last examples, we can observe that the presence of ""dax lug"" leads to the output ""green blue,"" which suggests that the word ""lug"" could correspond to the color ""blue."" 

To further verify, let's look at the other examples. In every output, immediately following a sequence that includes ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is present. For instance, in example 2, ""lug"" appears between ""bluf"" and ""zup,"" and the corresponding colors are ""red red blue yellow,"" where ""blue"" immediately follows ""lug"".

From all available information, ""lug"" directly correlates with the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
By examining the sequences, we can try to figure out the correlation between the word ""wif"" and the colors mentioned in the output.

From the first example, we can see that ""wif"" is associated with the color red:
- Input: zup wif dax walm lug
- Output: yellow red green green green blue

We see this pattern of ""wif"" translating to ""red"" is consistent in all provided examples:
- Input: zup wif zup
- Output: yellow red yellow
- Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
- Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
- Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
- Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
- Input: wif
- Output: red

In every instance, regardless of position or surrounding words, ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> blue
Given the examples provided, let's examine each instance where the nonce word ""walm"" is used and the output it generates.

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

2. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green

3. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

4. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

Based on these observations, we notice that every time ""walm"" appears in the input, three of the same color appear in the output. Additionally, we can also note that the color associated with ""walm"" corresponds to the color of the word that precedes it:

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue""

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug walm
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue blue,yellow yellow blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that ""lug"" stands for the color blue. Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. Let's break down each example:

- Input: zup lug walm 
  Output: yellow blue blue blue
  Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" seems to also correspond to ""blue.""

- Input: dax lug bluf dax 
  Output: green blue blue green
  In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue.""

- Input: lug dax bluf 
  Output: blue green green
  Following the pattern, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""bluf"" is ""green.""

- Input: lug walm wif bluf 
  Output: blue blue blue red red
  ""Lug"" matches with ""blue,"" ""walm"" with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""bluf"" also with ""red.""

- Input: zup lug bluf wif 
  Output: yellow blue blue red
  Translating this one, ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red.""

The consistent rule here is that ""lug"" always translates to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the context provided by other nonce words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, where each example of ""wif"" corresponds to the same output:

Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Input: zup dax wif -> Output: yellow green red
Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
Input: lug wif dax wif -> Output: blue red green red
Input: wif -> Output: red

It is clear that every time the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the output ""yellow"". However, looking closer at the patterns, especially in the third example ""Input: zup lug walm wif walm Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" it seems that ""zup"" does not only output a single ""yellow"", but rather triggers a repetition in the output based on the following words. That is, ""lug"" results in ""blue"", but when ""walm"" follows ""lug"", it is tripled in the output (""blue blue blue"")—likewise for ""wif"" being tripled into ""red red red"".

By considering all examples and comparing the input to the corresponding output, the following rule for ""zup"" can be deduced:

Rule: When ""zup"" is presented before a word, it causes the color associated with the following word to be repeated an amount corresponding to the number of times the following word appears consecutively in the input sequence. If ""zup"" is presented alone, it would simply output ""yellow"".

Hence: 
zup -> Repeat the color corresponding to the next word the number of times the word appears consecutively after ""zup"" or output ""yellow"" if ""zup"" is alone.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. We can discern this by examining when the word ""bluf"" appears in the input and when ""red"" appears in the output. Each time ""bluf"" is present, the word ""red"" directly corresponds to it in the output sequence, regardless of the other words surrounding it. 

Here are the given examples with the relevant parts highlighted:

Example 1:
- Input: wif **bluf** zup wif lug dax
- Output: red **red** yellow red blue green

Example 2:
- Input: wif **bluf** lug zup
- Output: red **red** blue yellow

Example 3:
- Input: zup wif **bluf**
- Output: yellow red **red**

Example 4:
- Input: dax **bluf**
- Output: green **green**

Example 5:
- Input: wif lug **bluf** wif zup
- Output: red blue **blue** red yellow

However, we have an inconsistency in Example 4 where ""dax bluf"" gives the output ""green green,"" contradicting our earlier observations. This inconsistency suggests that ""bluf"" might reflect the color preceding it. 

Let's reanalyze with this in mind:

Example 1 (consistency check):
- Input: wif **bluf** zup wif lug dax
- Output: red **red** yellow red blue green

Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red."" Hence, ""bluf"" being ""red"" after ""wif"" is consistent.

Example 2 (consistency check):
- Input: wif **bluf** lug zup
- Output: red **red** blue yellow

Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), and the output is consistent with the pattern of ""bluf"" reflecting the color of the word before it.

Example 4 (re-analysis):
- Input: dax **bluf**
- Output: green **green**

Now, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green,"" supporting the notion that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the preceding word.

Since Examples 3 and 5 also follow the same pattern, we can adjust our rule accordingly:

Rule:
bluf -> the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" defaults to ""red.""
Given the examples, we can look for patterns to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm.""

Let's breakdown the examples:

1. zup wif lug zup walm
   - Output: yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

2. dax walm zup lug dax
   - Output: green green green yellow blue green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" and again, ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

3. lug wif dax zup walm
   - Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" and ""zup"" with ""yellow.""

4. zup walm
   - Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow.""

5. lug wif walm
   - Output: blue red red red
   - ""lug"" correlates with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red.""

Now, let's check where ""walm"" appears and what follows it:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""walm"" is followed by a series of ""yellow.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" which corresponds with ""green,"" but it doesn't follow the pattern of ""green yellow yellow yellow"" which means it doesn't inherit the color before it.
- In example 5, ""walm"" appears after ""wif"" and is followed by ""red red red,"" but it's not ""red blue blue blue,"" which means it doesn't just repeat the pattern before it.

Since ""walm"" is followed by three of the same color every time it appears and that color is not dependent on the word/color before it, we can induce that ""walm"" might mean ""repeat the last color three times.""

Rule:
walm -> repeat the last color three times

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax lug dax
    ",Output: green yellow green green blue green,green yellow green blue green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given context.
Based on the outputs corresponding to each input where the word ""dax"" is used, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"". Regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words, the appearance of ""dax"" translates to ""green"" each time. Additionally, there are instances where ""dax"" appears multiple times within the same input, and each occurrence still results in the output of ""green"".

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red.' Each time 'wif' is mentioned in the input, 'red' appears in the output. Here's the correspondence illustrated:

1. Input: zup bluf wif walm
   Output: yellow yellow red red red
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red' appearing in the sequence.

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red' in the sequence.

3. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green
   - 'wif' corresponds to 'red'.

4. Input: wif lug zup bluf
   Output: red blue yellow yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red' in the sequence.

5. Input: dax walm wif walm zup
   Output: green green green red red red yellow
   - 'wif' corresponds to the first 'red' appearing after the three 'green'.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the output contains the word ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. Therefore, we can infer that:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the repetition of the previous color mentioned. To clarify:

- When ""lug bluf"" is the input, the output is ""blue blue."" ""Bluf"" repeats the color ""blue"" that was just mentioned.
- When ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow red green red red."" Again, ""bluf"" repeats the last color ""red.""
- When ""zup bluf lug zup walm"" is input, the output is ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow."" ""Bluf"" here repeats ""yellow,"" the color mentioned just before.
- When ""zup bluf"" is the input, the output is ""yellow yellow"" where ""bluf"" again repeats the preceding color.
- Finally, when ""zup lug zup lug zup bluf"" is input, the output is ""yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow,"" where ""bluf"" repeats the last color, which is ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: bluf -> repeat the last mentioned color.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

For example, let's dissect one of the provided cases:

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

The word ""dax"" is associated with the color green. Since ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"" repeated three times – once for ""dax"" and two additional times because ""walm"" requires repeating the color.

Thus, the rule can be written as:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Here is how this deduction aligns with the examples:

1. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red green
   - Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the first ""red"", while ""walm"" and ""dax"" seem to also correspond to ""red"" and ""green"" respectively.

2. Input: wif bluf zup wif lug dax
   Output: red red yellow red blue green
   - ""wif"" appears twice and both times it translates to ""red"". ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

3. Input: wif lug
   Output: red blue
   - ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

4. Input: lug wif lug
   Output: blue red blue
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" and is found before and after ""wif"", which again corresponds to ""red"".

5. Input: wif
   Output: red
   - Alone, ""wif"" still translates to ""red"".

So the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color yellow. Here's the analysis leading to this conclusion:

- In every input where ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.
- In inputs where ""zup"" is not present, the word ""yellow"" is also absent from the output.
- The position of ""zup"" within the input does not seem to affect its corresponding output of ""yellow"", as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> red. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the color red in the given examples.
walm -> repetitive color output based on a preceding word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" is present, it repeats the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. The colors are assigned as follows:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""lug"" introduces blue, and it follows the pattern that after ""lug"" the color blue is repeated.

Using this rule, ""walm"" translates into a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with the number of repetitions equal to the number of syllables in the preceding word (e.g., ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow"" repeated once, ""zup wif walm"" -> ""red"" repeated twice, ""dax lug walm"" -> ""blue"" repeated three times).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in a sequence of other nonce words. Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Each output is a sequence of color names, and ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
From the given examples, it seems that ""zup"" maps to a specific color output, and that output is dependent on the context of the preceding words. In every example where ""zup"" is the first word, its output is ""yellow"". When ""zup"" follows another color word or ""zup"" itself, it still outputs ""yellow"". Therefore, ""zup"" seems to consistently correspond to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position in the input.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeats the color associated with the previous word. Rule: If a word precedes bluf, the color that corresponds to that word is repeated for bluf's output.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word 'walm' affects the colors following it until a different color is mentioned. Specifically, it seems to cause the repetition of the color that comes immediately after it, until a new color word interrupts the pattern. Let's break down each input and output to better determine the rule:

Input: zup dax walm lug wif
Output: yellow green green green blue red
- 'zup' corresponds to yellow, 'dax' to green.
- After 'walm', 'lug' (which would be blue based on the second example) is repeated until 'wif' which is red.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- 'zup' corresponds to yellow, 'lug' to blue.
- After 'walm', 'wif' is repeated until 'dax' which is green.

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- 'dax' corresponds to green.
- After 'walm', 'wif' is repeated until 'zup' which is yellow.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- 'dax' corresponds to green.
- 'walm' is followed by no specific color, implying 'green' is repeated (though this is less clear without a following color to confirm the pattern).

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
- 'dax' corresponds to green.
- After 'walm', 'wif' is repeated until 'bluf' which is red.

Based on the examples, it appears that 'walm' repeats the color word that comes immediately after it until a different color word appears.

Rule:
walm -> Causes the next color word to repeat until a different color word occurs.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue yellow yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" 

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following mappings:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""

Looking at the common element in each input, ""wif"" always maps to ""red"" in the output. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" results in ""red"".

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: bluf -> blue
From the examples given, it appears that the output color sequence always contains a certain number of ""red"" words immediately following the word ""walm."" The number of ""red"" occurrences is equal to the number of times ""wif"" appears after ""walm."" Otherwise, the other words correspond to a unique color each time they appear.

Looking at the examples for patterns:

1. Input: wif walm -> Output: red red red
   There is one ""wif"" following ""walm"" and the output is three ""red.""

2. Input: dax walm zup lug -> Output: green green green yellow blue
   There is one ""zup"" following ""walm,"" no ""wif,"" and the output is three ""green.""

3. Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   There is one ""dax"" following ""walm,"" no ""wif,"" and the output is three ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   There are two ""wif"" following ""walm"" and the output after ""walm"" is three ""red"" followed by ""blue.""

5. Input: lug walm wif lug -> Output: blue blue blue red blue
   There is one ""wif"" following ""walm"" and the output after ""walm"" is three ""blue,"" then one ""red,"" which corresponds to the ""wif.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that the word ""walm"" results in the output of three colors corresponding to the nearest word to its right that is not ""wif."" If ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" it is indicated by a ""red"" after the three colors.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the next word (not ""wif"") three times. If ""wif"" follows, add a ""red"" for each instance of it after these three colors.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in each example given.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". This conclusion is supported by the fact that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

The other words in the input and output also show consistent one-to-one mappings to colors:

- ""lug"" is consistently mapped to ""blue"".
- ""dax"" is consistently mapped to ""green"".
- ""wif"" is consistently mapped to ""red"".
- ""bluf"" is not paired with a color in these examples but we can infer from the last example that it is mapped to ""blue"" because it appears alongside ""lug"", which is already established as mapping to ""blue"".

As such, the rule for ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" seems to represent a repetition of the color specified by the immediately preceding word. In each example, the output color word that corresponds to ""bluf"" is the same as the color output of the word before it.
walm -> three identical color repetitions based on the preceding word.

Rule: When walm follows another word, it results in three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word:
- wif precedes walm, yielding ""red red red""
- lug precedes walm, yielding ""blue blue blue""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided input and output examples, I will analyze each instance to determine what ""lug"" could mean.

Input: wif lug
Output: red blue
Here, ""lug"" appears to follow ""wif"" and the output corresponds with the color ""blue."" 

Input: dax lug
Output: green blue
Again, ""lug"" is at the end and ""blue"" appears as the last color in the output.

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue
Here, ""lug"" appears at the end again and ""blue"" is the last color in the output.

Input: lug zup lug
Output: blue yellow blue
In this case, ""lug"" is both at the beginning and the end. The output starts and ends with ""blue,"" which suggests that ""lug"" could represent ""blue.""

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red
Here, ""lug"" comes first and ""blue"" is the first color in the output, reinforcing the idea that ""lug"" might be ""blue.""

Given that ""blue"" consistently appears in the output when ""lug"" is in the input, either at the beginning or the end, and that ""lug"" doesn't seem to correspond to any other color or word irrespective of its position, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. The word 'wif' consistently maps to 'red,' 'lug' maps to 'blue,' and 'bluf' maps to 'yellow.' Given that 'zup' does not consistently map to a single color, it is likely a variable that depends on context; however, in every instance where 'zup' appears, the output contains 'yellow.'

Here are the consistent mappings:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> yellow

Looking closer at the examples, 'zup' produces 'yellow' regardless of its position, as seen in examples where 'zup' is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input sequence. Thus, the rule appears to be that 'zup' corresponds directly to 'yellow.'

So the rule for 'zup' is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the commonalities and differences in the given inputs and outputs:

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue

3. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

Now let's break down each input-output pair to understand what ""walm"" might represent:

- Outputs corresponding to ""lug"" are always blue.
- Outputs corresponding to ""dax"" are always green.
- Outputs corresponding to ""zup"" are always yellow.
- Outputs corresponding to ""wif"" are always red.
- Outputs corresponding to ""walm"" need to be deduced.

In the cases where ""walm"" is present:

1. ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" and ""lug walm"" again results in ""blue blue blue."" This suggests that ""walm"" may be repeating the preceding color, in this context, three times. But that pattern doesn't hold in every case because ""dax walm"" only results in a doubling of ""green.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" results in ""red red green green green."" There is no color for ""bluf,"" but ""dax walm"" again results in double green, suggesting repetition.

4. ""wif walm dax zup"" results in ""red red red green yellow,"" and here ""walm"" follows ""wif"" giving us triple ""red"". So there might be a pattern of ""walm"" generating one extra occurrence of the preceding color; however, this pattern does not hold for the combinations with ""dax.""

5. ""wif lug dax walm"" results in ""red blue green green green,"" and here ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting again in a doubling of ""green.""

Given these observations, the replication of the preceding color seems to hold except for when ""walm"" follows ""dax."" However, the number of repetitions varies.

Examining the discrepancies, one might suspect that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately before it, but the exact number of repetitions might be influenced by that preceding word's inherent ""power"" to generate repetitions, or by the combination with ""walm"" itself. ""lug"" combined with ""walm"" consistently triples the output (""blue blue blue""), whereas ""dax"" doubled when combined with ""walm.""

Considering the variability and based on the provided examples, it's difficult to establish an unambiguous rule without more data to confirm the behavior when ""walm"" follows different words.

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it an uncertain number of times, which seems to vary depending on that preceding word. With ""lug"" it triples and with ""dax,"" it doubles the output color, but we cannot determine a consistent rule for other cases without more examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in every provided example.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax.""

In each instance, the output ""green"" appears immediately after the word ""dax.""

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

In this example, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the output sequence starts with ""green,"" followed by a series of other colors corresponding to the other words.

Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup,"" which is translated to ""yellow,"" and then ""dax"" is translated to ""green.""

Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
Output: red green yellow red green green

Once again, every instance of ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Input: zup dax wif
Output: yellow green red

""dax"" succeeded by ""wif"" results in ""green red"" in the output, with ""green"" corresponding to ""dax.""

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green

In every case, ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. It does not appear to depend on the context or the position of ""wif"" in the input sequence. Whether ""wif"" is at the beginning, middle, or end of a sequence, the word ""red"" is present in the output. 

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> meaning.

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or surrounding words.
Rule: zup -> yellow. 

zup consistently translates to the color yellow in all given examples.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to compare the inputs to their corresponding outputs and identify the pattern. Let's look at the given examples and outputs:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup walm lug wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red

From the first and second examples, it's clear that the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" output. Since ""zup walm"" leads to three yellows, and ""zup"" corresponds to one yellow, ""walm"" must correspond to the other two yellows in the output.

In the third example, ""zup walm"" again leads to three yellows, and ""lug wif"" leads to ""blue red,"" which is consistent with their other occurrences. Therefore, ""walm"" doesn't seem to affect the output of other words adjacent to it.

In the fourth example, ignoring ""walm,"" let's run through the rest: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" seems like a misspelling or a variation of ""blue"" since it also corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" When ""walm"" is inserted, it follows the word ""wif,"" and there are two additional reds in the output. This could suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color related to the word that precedes it.

The fifth example further confirms this, as ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and following ""wif,"" there are three reds in the output (likely due to the presence of ""walm"").

Rule: walm -> meaning: The word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word before it two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" in the input corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" let's first see what color corresponds to each mention of ""dax"" in the examples:

1. dax -> green
2. dax (first occurrence) -> green
   dax (second occurrence) -> green
3. dax -> green
4. dax (first occurrence) -> green
   dax (second occurrence) -> green
5. dax -> green

""Dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input string. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""wif"":

1. When ""wif"" appears before other words, the following words are repeated in the output, for example:
   - Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
     Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   Notice ""bluf"" and ""lug"" that follow ""wif"" are repeated as ""yellow yellow"" and ""blue blue"", but ""zup,"" ""walm,"" and ""dax"" are not.
   - Input: wif bluf
     Output: red red
   Here ""bluf"" is repeated as ""red red"" immediately after ""wif.""
   - Input: wif lug
     Output: red blue
   Here ""lug"" is repeated as ""blue"" immediately after ""wif.""
   - Input: lug wif walm
     Output: blue red red red
   ""Walm"" is repeated as ""red red red"" after ""wif.""
   - Input: zup bluf wif bluf
     Output: yellow yellow red red
   ""Bluf"" is repeated as ""red red"" after ""wif.""

2. When ""wif"" comes after another word, the word that follows ""wif"" is not repeated in the output.
   - In the third and last examples, ""wif"" is followed by other words, but those words are not repeated in the output.

3. The color ""red"" is consistently present in the output immediately after ""wif"" is mentioned in the input.

Combining these observations, we could infer that ""wif"" indicates the following rule:

Rule:
- When ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" appears immediately after it in the output. Moreover, the word following ""wif"" is to be repeated in color representation if ""wif"" precedes it in the input. If ""wif"" is preceded by another word, the word after ""wif"" does not get repeated in the output.

Therefore:

wif -> The presence of the word ""wif"" triggers an output of ""red"" followed by a repetition of the subsequent word's corresponding color unless ""wif"" is preceded by another word, in which case the following word's corresponding color does not get repeated.
According to the provided examples, every instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow"". No context or further transformation is provided that alters the meaning of ""zup"". Therefore, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" means ""yellow"".
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" we need to look at the occurrences of the word in the given input and their corresponding outputs.

1. In contexts where ""dax"" or ""lug"" precedede or follow ""bluf,"" the output color for ""bluf"" is the same as the preceding/following word (""green"" for ""dax"" and ""blue"" for ""lug""). This happens in:
   - Input 1: dax bluf -> Output 1: green green
   - Input 2: lug bluf -> Output 2: blue blue

2. In contexts where ""bluf"" stands alone or is followed by a word that has not been mentioned in the rules deduced from the other examples (like ""zup"" or ""wif""), ""bluf"" still corresponds to the color of that word:
   - Input 3: zup bluf -> Output 3: yellow yellow
   - Input 4: dax lug wif bluf -> Output 4: green blue red red (here it is implied that ""wif"" is red)
   - Input 5: lug bluf -> Output 5: blue blue

Considering all the inputs and outputs given, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that either immediately precedes or follows it. Since ""bluf"" does not change this color (green stays green, blue stays blue, etc.), we can deduce that ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the adjacent word"".

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the adjacent word.
To deduce the meaning or the rule behind the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look closely at each example:

1. Input: zup walm dax zup dax wif
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
   Analysis: ""walm"" is followed by ""dax"" and translates to ""yellow green.""

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and precedes ""lug,"" and translates to ""red red.""

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Analysis: The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green green,"" and the second follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green green"" again.

4. Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and translates to ""green green.""

5. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   Analysis: ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and translates to ""yellow yellow.""

After analyzing the instances, a pattern emerges that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. For example, when ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which is output as ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow."" When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is output as ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green.""

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug walm dax walm
    ",Output: green blue blue blue green green green,green blue blue blue green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the sequences provided, we can gather the following information:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding output.
- No other colored output is consistently paired with ""lug"".

Given these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""lug"" in these examples:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif"" also corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" once again corresponds to the color ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is again associated with the color ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Based on these examples, it appears that regardless of its position in the sentence or the surrounding words, ""wif"" is consistently translated to the color ""red.""

wif -> ""red"" 

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by looking at the corresponding outputs.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

From this, we might infer that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Here, ""zup"" is followed by two other nonce words ""dax"" and ""bluf"", which correspond to ""green"" and ""green"" respectively in the output. This further reinforces our previous inference that ""zup"" means ""yellow"".

Input: zup lug
Output: yellow blue

Again ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" seems to correlate to ""blue"".

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

In this string, ""zup"" occurs after three instances of ""wif walm dax"" which translates to ""red red red green"", suggesting that these other nonce words have their own meanings. But regardless of their positions, ""zup"" still translates to ""yellow"".

Input: wif zup lug zup lug
Output: red yellow blue yellow blue

Despite the addition of the nonce word ""wif"" at the beginning, ""zup"" still corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""lug"" with ""blue"".

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be consistent across examples, and it can be deduced that:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"".
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"". Every instance of ""bluf"" outputs the word ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" appears to correspond to the color ""blue."" Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" is repeated in the output. However, the number of times ""blue"" is repeated seems to depend on another factor.

Let's examine the outputs more closely:

1. Input: ""wif dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""red green blue blue blue""
2. Input: ""lug walm dax"" -> Output: ""blue blue blue green""
3. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> Output: ""red red red blue blue""
4. Input: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> Output: ""yellow red green green green""
5. Input: ""dax lug walm"" -> Output: ""green blue blue blue""

Here are the observed rules:

- ""wif"" results in ""red""
- ""dax"" results in ""green""
- ""lug"" results in ""blue""
- ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" is likely resulting in a single ""blue"" (as seen in the third example).

Looking at the first example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which matches with the output ""blue blue blue."" In the second example, ""walm"" is in between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the output is ""blue blue blue green,"" suggesting ""walm"" is still matched with ""blue."" In the third example ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" and the output is still multiple ""reds"" followed by multiple ""blues.""

Examining the commonality, it seems that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. The following rule can be deduced:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (such as ""wif,"" ""dax,"" or ""lug""), it results in the repetition of the corresponding color output multiple times. Specifically, ""walm"" results in at least two more of the same color that precedes it.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" would be that it is a placeholder for repetition, implying multiple iterations of the last color mentioned before it.

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repetition of the preceding color, resulting in the mentioned color appearing multiple times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the given context translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". The number of times ""dax"" appears in the input corresponds to the number of times ""green"" appears in the output. Moreover, ""dax"" does not seem to modify the colors dictated by other words; it contributes an additional green for each of its occurrences.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: Each occurrence of ""dax"" in the input results in an additional ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can analyze the relationship between the input and the output to determine the rule for the word ""wif"".

Input: wif lug dax
Output: red blue green

In this example, ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""dax"", whose outputs are ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively, while ""wif"" outputs to ""red"".

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Here, ""wif"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"", with ""zup"" translating to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"" again; ""wif"" remains ""red"".

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red

In this case, ""wif"" is at the end of a sequence, following several other terms, but regardless of its position, it still translates to ""red"".

Input: wif
Output: red

With ""wif"" standing alone, it still corresponds to ""red"".

Input: lug wif lug wif lug
Output: blue red blue red blue

Here, ""wif"" is used twice in a sequence with ""lug"". Both instances of ""wif"" correspond to ""red"" irrespective of their position around ""lug"", which consistently translates to ""blue"".

Rule: 
wif -> red

Regardless of its position in the sequence, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" by analyzing the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Input: wif zup bluf
Output: red yellow yellow

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

From the examples provided, every time the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output. ""Bluf"" is present in all five examples, and the corresponding output is always ""red"" at the same position where ""bluf"" appears in the input.

Also, it does not seem to matter what the other words are (""dax,"" ""zup,"" ""lug""), as they correspond to different colors in the output (""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue""), while the output for ""bluf"" remains unchanged.

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"". It seems that ""walm"" is associated with a set of colors repeated a number of times. The specific color and the number of times it is repeated depends on the preceding word. Here is the rule I have deduced for the examples given:

- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green"" repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red"" repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output changes to ""yellow,"" repeated three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue,"" although the repetition is not clear from a single example.

Thus, the word ""walm"" seems to induce a color output that depends on the previous word, generally with a repetition of three times for the established cases. We don't have enough information about ""lug walm"" to determine the exact rule for ""lug.""

Rule: walm causes the preceding word to translate into a specific color to be outputted three times, except for ""lug,"" where the number of repetitions is uncertain based on the provided examples.

So the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context and cannot be translated to just one word. In each case, ""walm"" causes a transformation of the previous word into a color, which is then outputted multiple times.

walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" induces the output of a color associated with the preceding word, typically repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" correlates to the color blue in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each time the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" Regardless of the words surrounding ""dax"" or their corresponding colors, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'zup' corresponds to a specific color. The color indicated by 'zup' seems to depend on the color mentioned before it. Here's the rule I observed:

1. When 'zup' follows the word for 'blue' (i.e., ""lug""), 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'.
2. When 'zup' does not follow the word for 'blue', it seems to take on the color of whatever word comes immediately before it, if that word represents a color.

However, the last example does not fully align with rule 2, as 'zup' follows 'walm' (which corresponds to 'yellow') but 'zup' results in 'blue' instead of 'yellow'. This could indicate an exception or a more complex rule that has not been fully captured by the presented data.

Applying these observations, the rule is:

Rule: zup following 'lug' (blue) -> yellow. In other instances, zup takes on the color of the word preceding it, except when following 'walm' (which corresponds to blue), where it appears to result in blue.

Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: ""walm"" represents a repetition of the color word that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". If ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"", ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in ""blue blue blue"". Similarly, if ""dax"" is associated with ""green"", ""walm"" after ""dax"" results in ""green green green"". The pattern follows for other word-color associations presented in the examples.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
To identify the meaning of ""dax"" we'll review the provided examples and their outputs, searching for patterns and deducing rules. Starting with the outputs associated with ""dax"":

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
2. Input: wif dax lug walm
   Output: red green blue blue blue
3. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
4. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
5. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

First, let's notice that ""dax"" never repeats within the same input, meaning we are not likely to attribute a repeating pattern to the presence of ""dax"". Now, we look at the position of ""dax"" within the inputs and its associated color in the outputs:

- In the 1st example, ""dax"" results in ""green"", when it is the third word.
- In the 2nd example, ""dax"" results in ""green"", when it is the second word.
- In the 3rd example, ""dax"" results in ""green"", no matter the position, since it comes out as ""green"" when it is the second word.
- In the 4th example, ""dax"" results in ""green"", again independent of position, being the last word.
- In the 5th example, ""dax"" is the first word and results in ""green"".

Across all examples, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output color is ""green"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. It's also noted that other words have a fixed color output: ""wif"" always results in ""red"", ""lug"" in ""blue"", ""walm"" in ""blue"", ""zup"" in ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" in ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green. The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" independent of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look at the correspondence between the input and the output in each example:

Example 1:
Input: dax wif lug
Output: green red blue

Example 2:
Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green

Example 3:
Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue

Example 4:
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
Output: red yellow yellow red green

Example 5:
Input: wif lug
Output: red blue

Based on the outputs provided, we can make the following observations about ""wif"" and the other words:

1. When ""wif"" appears before another word, the color ""red"" always appears at the corresponding position in the output. 
2. The word ""dax"" produces ""green,"" ""lug"" produces ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" produces ""red"" consistently.
3. ""walm"" repeats the color ""blue"" three times in the third example, suggesting that this word may mean ""repeat the previous color twice more"" or similar. This appears again in the output of the fourth example, where ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and is translated into ""yellow."" ""Yellow"" is not repeated like ""blue"" in the third example, so it might not be a simple repeating function.
4. There is no clear indication of what ""zup"" means, but since it appears only once in the context and translates to ""yellow,"" it might mean ""yellow"" in the context of this sequence.

From these observations, we can deduce the meaning of ""wif"" is consistently associated with the output color ""red,"" thus:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the word 'zup' by looking at the input and output sequences and identifying patterns.

In every instance where 'zup' is mentioned in the input, 'yellow' appears in the output. Hence, it's reasonable to deduce that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow'. To further test this hypothesis, we'll check whether 'yellow' is introduced into the output sequence only when 'zup' is present in the input:

1. Input: zup wif → Output: **yellow** red
2. Input: dax lug zup → Output: green blue **yellow**
3. Input: wif walm dax zup → Output: red red red green **yellow**
4. Input: zup lug → Output: **yellow** blue
5. Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm → Output: red red red **yellow** blue **yellow yellow** yellow

In all cases, whenever 'zup' is in the input, 'yellow' appears the same number of times in the output. Furthermore, the position of 'yellow' in the output corresponds to the position of 'zup' in the input. Hence, the rule for 'zup' can be deduced as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow' in the given sequences.
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that directly follows it. If there is no word following it, bluf uses the color of the word directly preceding it.

Rule: When bluf is followed by another word, the output is the color associated with that following word. When bluf is at the end of a sequence, the output is the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here is the deduced pattern:

- In the first example ""lug dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green (Output: blue green green green), with ""walm"" causing green to repeat three times.

- In the second example ""lug walm zup,"" the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue (Output: blue blue blue yellow), with ""walm"" causing blue to repeat twice before a new color (yellow) is introduced by ""zup.""

- In the third example ""lug walm wif,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""walm"" repeats blue twice before ""wif"" introduces red.

- In the fourth example ""zup lug walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color blue three times.

- In the fifth example ""lug walm zup walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue, ""walm"" repeats blue twice, ""zup"" introduces yellow, and the second occurrence of ""walm"" repeats yellow three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is produced in the output. This is consistently demonstrated across all examples.
From the examples provided, it is possible to deduce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green

Every time the word ""dax"" is provided in the input, regardless of its position in the sequence of words, the output is ""green"". The consistency of this response suggests that ""dax"" directly corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output. This is consistent across all examples.

However, we can also see patterns with other words:
- ""lug"" seems to correlate with the color ""blue"" because every time ""lug"" appears, ""blue"" follows in the output.
- ""walm"" might correlate with the color ""yellow"" because whenever ""walm"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is in the output.
- ""bluf"" seems to correlate with repeating the previous color because it always follows the previously mentioned color since it's after ""lug"" (which we've determined to mean ""blue""), and the output is a repetition of ""blue"".

Therefore, the rules appear to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: walm -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeat previous color
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Here's the breakdown:

- ""zup walm"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow"" (This suggests ""walm"" might mean ""yellow"" as well.)
- ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow"" (Here, ""lug"" probably corresponds to ""blue"".)
- ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
- ""zup bluf lug"" -> ""yellow yellow blue"" (This could mean ""bluf"" also translates to ""yellow"", since it precedes ""yellow"".)
- ""wif dax zup bluf"" -> ""red green yellow yellow"" 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color that precedes it. In each example featuring ""bluf"", the color word that comes before it is repeated in the output.

Here are the deduced rules according to each provided input and output:

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red
Explanation: ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.

Input: lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue yellow
Explanation: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" causes ""blue"" to repeat. ""zup"" then translates to ""yellow"".

Input: lug dax bluf
Output: blue green green
Explanation: ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". ""bluf"" causes the word ""green"" to repeat.

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
Explanation: ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". ""bluf"" causes the word ""yellow"" to repeat.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word that follows it. To verify:

- In example 1, ""walm wif"" leads to ""blue blue"" and the color for ""wif"" is blue.
- In example 2, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" thus ""walm"" takes the color yellow from ""zup.""
- In example 3, ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red,"" which implies that ""walm"" is taking the red color from ""wif.""
- In example 4, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"" indicating that ""walm"" takes the blue color from ""lug.""
- In example 5, ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" suggesting ""walm"" takes the yellow color from ""zup.""

If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence with nothing to follow, we can hypothesize that it repeats the preceding color based on example 2, where ""walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow green"" and ""dax"" is green.

Rule: walm -> assumes the color of the next word in the sequence; if there is no following word, it assumes the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To determine the meaning of ""lug,"" we must look at the output when ""lug"" is included in the input and see what output it generates.

Looking at all provided input-output pairs, we can observe the following:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
2. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red
3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
4. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow

Analyzing the outputs in association with the word ""lug,"" it's clear that the immediate result following ""lug"" is always ""blue."" This indicates the direct translation of ""lug"" to the color ""blue."" 

Further, we can notice:
- ""wif"" leads to ""red.""
- ""dax"" leads to ""green.""
- ""zup"" leads to a pattern of repeating ""yellow,"" with the repetition count increasing by one each time ""zup"" appears.
- ""walm"" is also associated with ""yellow,"" potentially repeating the last color mentioned, as seen in example 3 where ""walm"" follows ""zup.""

If ""lug"" indeed always means ""blue,"" then its output should be consistent across different contexts. Checking this against our examples:

1. Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue (here ""lug"" is blue)
2. Input: dax lug wif -> Output: green blue red (here ""lug"" is blue)
3. Input: lug wif dax zup walm -> Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow (the first ""lug"" is blue)
4. Input: zup lug walm -> Output: yellow blue blue blue (the ""lug"" is blue and ""walm"" repeats the last color given)
5. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow (the ""lug"" is blue)

Given these observations, the meaning of ""lug"" in the given context appears consistent:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" across all the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the outputs corresponding to each appearance of ""wif"" in the input:

- In example 1, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in both instances.
- In example 2, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 3, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 4, ""wif"" is the only input and corresponds to ""red.""
- In example 5, ""wif"" appears once and corresponds to ""red.""

Given that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in every example provided, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Every time the word ""zup"" appears in an input, the output includes the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each input alongside its corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup
   Output: yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
   - Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Since ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""yellow"" on both sides the first time it appears, and by ""green"" on one side and ""yellow"" on the other the second time it appears, we can infer that ""bluf"" might be causing a repetition of the previous color.

2. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and the output is ""yellow"" followed by ""yellow"" again, suggesting that ""bluf"" might cause the repetition of ""zup's"" color which is yellow.

3. Input: dax bluf zup
   Output: green green yellow
   - Here, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green) and it is followed by ""green"" in the output, supporting the idea that ""bluf"" is causing the repetition of the previous word's associated color.

4. Input: zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow yellow blue
   - The repetition pattern holds here as well. ""Yellow"" follows ""zup"" twice before changing to ""blue"" after ""lug.""

5. Input: lug dax bluf
   Output: blue green green
   - Once again, the pattern is consistent. After ""dax"" comes ""bluf,"" and ""green"" is repeated.

Judging by these examples, ""bluf"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it. Therefore, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the previous word's associated color.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a rule where it repeats the color associated with the previous word. Let's break down the examples to understand how we come to this conclusion:

- Input: lug zup walm lug
  Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
  The word ""lug"" is associated with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" repeating the color yellow before we see ""lug"" again at the end with its blue color.

- Input: zup walm
  Output: yellow yellow yellow
  Here, ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" and ""walm"" continues to repeat the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

- Input: zup walm dax
  Output: yellow yellow yellow green
  Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow, until we reach ""dax,"" which is associated with green.

- Input: dax walm wif walm zup
  Output: green green green red red red yellow
  ""Dax"" is green, ""walm"" repeats green, ""wif"" is associated with red, and ""walm"" repeats red until ""zup"" introduces yellow again.

- Input: wif bluf dax walm
  Output: red red green green green
  ""Wif"" is red; however, ""bluf"" seems to be unassociated with a color directly but does not disrupt the sequence since ""wif"" repeats, followed by ""dax,"" which is green. ""Walm"" repeats the color green for ""dax.""

Based on these analyses, the rule for ""walm"" is that it repeats the color of the word that precedes it. If the preceding word has an associated color, ""walm"" takes on that color in the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ","Output: red
",red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: In all of the provided examples, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and their corresponding outputs to look for patterns.

- Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
- Input: zup bluf dax -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup -> Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow
- Input: zup bluf dax (repeated) -> Output: yellow yellow green
- Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red

Here are the observations from the above examples:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output color for ""bluf"" is always green. This is seen in the following inputs:
    - ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red
    - ""zup bluf dax"" -> yellow yellow green (although ""bluf"" does not directly follow ""dax"", the output for ""bluf"" is still yellow, which is a clue)
    - ""dax bluf wif"" -> green green red
    
2. When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output color for ""bluf"" is always red. This is seen in the initial example, ""dax wif bluf"" -> green red red.

3. When ""bluf"" follows ""lug"", the output color for ""bluf"" is always blue, as seen in ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" -> blue blue red blue blue yellow.

4. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output color for ""bluf"" is always yellow, as seen in ""zup bluf dax"" -> yellow yellow green.

Based on the observations and available data, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a color that is dependent on the preceding word. The pattern is as follows:

- After ""dax"", ""bluf"" represents green.
- After ""wif"", ""bluf"" represents red.
- After ""lug"", ""bluf"" represents blue.
- After ""zup"", ""bluf"" represents yellow.

It's not possible to mechanistically say ""bluf"" means a specific color without context, as its meaning changes based on the word that comes before it. Considering this, ""bluf"" seems to represent a variable color based on the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> represents a color that depends on the preceding word: green after ""dax"", red after ""wif"", blue after ""lug"", and yellow after ""zup"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a certain color being repeated three times. The exact color appears to be determined by the word that comes immediately before ""walm."" Here's the pattern according to the input and output pairs:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow red red red"" (Notice that ""zup"" here seems to influence both the first color ""yellow"" and the subsequent ""red red red""; hence, ""walm"" might be ""red red red"" in this context instead of ""blue blue blue"").
- ""lug walm"" remains ""blue blue blue"" when repeated.
- ""zup walm"" consistently produces three identical colors that follow ""zup.""

Based on these observations, it appears that:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" the output is ""blue blue blue.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" the output starts with a different color related to ""zup"" (""yellow"") and then gives three of another color (""red""). However, the first color (""yellow"") is not produced by ""walm"" but rather by ""zup.""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word three times. ""lug"" associates with ""blue,"" and while ""zup"" associates with ""yellow,"" it also interacts with ""walm"" in a way that produces ""red red red"" instead. This suggests that ""walm"" specifically yields ""blue blue blue"" when following ""lug"" and ""red red red"" when following ""zup.""

However, there is an observed inconsistency given that ""zup"" directly yields ""yellow"" and then ""walm"" yields ""red red red,"" creating a sequence of ""yellow red red red."" Given the inconsistency and assuming the inputs are correct, we might need additional examples to fully understand how ""walm"" behaves after ""zup.""

Based on the information currently available, the rule for ""walm"" could be described as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" -> meaning: ""walm"" is a placeholder for a series of three repeated colors. The specific color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""walm"": if it is ""lug,"" the color is ""blue""; if it is ""zup,"" the sequence is preceded by ""yellow"" from ""zup"" and followed by ""red red red"" from ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Rule: wif -> red
Analyzing the given input-output pairs:

1. Input: zup -> Output: yellow
2. Input: lug dax zup -> Output: blue green yellow
3. Input: zup dax -> Output: yellow green
4. Input: zup dax lug -> Output: yellow green blue
5. Input: zup wif lug dax -> Output: yellow red blue green

Looking at the examples, it is clear that each word corresponds to a specific color in the output. The placement of ""zup"" in different positions does not change its associated color, which consistently remains 'yellow'. Likewise, the placement of ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to the colors 'blue,' 'green,' and 'red' respectively, independent of their position in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule for what 'zup' means based on the provided examples is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" appears to have a consistent color association with the input word that precedes it. Here's the pattern seen in the examples:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- When preceded by ""wif,"" the output for ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

In the last example (""dax bluf""), ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green green.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color output of the word just before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we will examine the patterns in the examples provided.

1. Input: dax lug walm | Output: green blue blue blue
2. Input: dax walm lug | Output: green green green blue
3. Input: dax walm zup lug walm | Output: green green green yellow blue blue blue
4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif | Output: red red green green red red red blue red
5. Input: lug walm wif | Output: blue blue blue red

From the first and second examples, we can see that ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" When ""walm"" appears directly after ""lug,"" as in the first example, the output for ""walm"" is repeated ""blue."" When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" as in the second example, the output for ""walm"" is repeated ""green.""

In the third example, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and the pattern for ""walm"" continues, following the word right before it.

In the fourth example, ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and ""bluf"" seems to be translating to ""green."" The pattern for ""walm"" persists in following the word right before it, leading to repeated ""red.""

In the fifth example, since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and ""wif"" is ""red,"" the pattern continues with ""walm"" following the color of the word before it.

From the examples provided, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes immediately before it.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" is:

walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax zup wif walm
    ",Output: yellow green yellow red red red red,yellow green yellow red red red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given input and output examples, the meaning of ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green."" However, before finalizing this rule, it's important to note that the output for ""dax"" changes depending on its position or the context within the input string. To verify, let's examine the instances where ""dax"" appears:

- In the first example, ""dax"" appears both at the beginning and end, and translates to ""green"" in both cases.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is at the beginning and translates to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""dax"" is in the middle and also translates to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""dax"" appears at the end after a sequence of colors and translates to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"" and both translate to ""green.""

Therefore, the rule in this case seems consistent:

Rule: dax -> green
Observing the outputs corresponding to the inputs where the nonce word 'wif' is present, the following occurrences can be noted:
- Whenever 'wif' appears, the word 'red' is produced in the output.
- The amount of reds following 'wif' vary depending on what follows 'wif'. 

To deduce the meaning based on the given examples:
- When 'wif' is followed by 'walm', the output is 'red red red'.
- When 'wif' is surrounded by other words such as 'lug' or 'dax', a single 'red' appears in the output.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that 'wif' generates an output of 'red', and if followed by 'walm', it increases the output to three 'red'.

Rule: wif -> generates 'red' in the output; if followed by 'walm', output is 'red red red'.
zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each example provided. Rule: Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, it is translated as ""yellow"" in the output.
bluf -> blue. 

Rule: the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words around it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns within the examples provided.

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green

4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue

5. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

From these examples, we can observe the following:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and seems to be a universal separator, representing a transition.

Analyzing ""walm,"" we notice:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and the output is three ""green"". This suggests ""walm"" might mean a repetition of the preceding color word.
- In example 2, ""lug walm"" results in three ""blue"". Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue) and repeats it twice more.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and ""lug"" (blue). After both instances, it causes the repetition of the respective color words.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again, ""blue"" is repeated twice more.
- Finally, in example 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) and results in the repetition of ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule we can infer is:

Rule: ""walm"" -> ""walm"" means to repeat the color word immediately preceding it two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" I will analyze the output patterns in relation to the given input, focusing on the instances where ""dax"" is used.

1. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   Here, ""zup"" precedes ""dax"" and the corresponding output is ""yellow green.""

2. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Here, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup,"" but also has ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""walm"" preceding it. We notice that ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"" with ""yellow"" both before and after it.

3. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Here, ""dax"" is the only input and ""green"" is the only output.

4. Input: dax
   Output: green
   Here, ""dax"" is the only input and ""green"" is the only output, which reconfirms the pattern from the previous example.

5. Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
   Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
   Here, ""dax"" is again followed by ""zup"" and preceded by ""lug,"" and its corresponding output is ""green.""

Based on these examples, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of the words around it (whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the input). Other words appear to correspond to other colors consistently (""wif"" to ""red,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue""). Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" specifically translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> meaning. Meaning is ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the inputs and corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""wif"".

1. wif dax lug -> red green blue
2. zup lug wif -> yellow blue red
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. zup dax wif -> yellow green red
5. zup walm lug wif -> yellow yellow yellow blue red

Looking at the examples:

- In examples 1, 3, and 4, ""wif"" is at the beginning or end of the sequence and corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
- In example 2, ""wif"" is at the end and translates to ""red"".
- In example 5, ""wif"" is at the end and again translates to ""red"".

In all instances, ""wif"" consistently results in the color ""red"", regardless of its position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the output. The number of times ""zup"" is implied (explicitly stated or implied through another word), it is matched with an equivalent number of ""yellow"" mentions in the output. The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and ""walm"" seems to indicate repetition of the color indicated by the preceding word.

Rule: zup -> yellow. When ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, ""yellow"" should be in the output the same number of times ""zup"" or its effect is implied.
Rule: bluf means ""repeat the color of the previous word"" or ""duplicate the color associated with the previous word"".
Analyzing the examples provided, we can extract the following pattern:

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Here, every word before 'walm' appears to be repeated in the output except for 'lug' which is after 'walm', indicating that 'walm' may lead to a repetition of the following colors before a new color word appears.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow

Only 'zup' is before 'walm' and is repeated three times.

Input: zup bluf wif walm
Output: yellow yellow red red red

All words are colors and are all repeated in triplicate after 'walm'.

Input: lug dax walm
Output: blue green green green

Both 'lug' and 'dax' are before 'walm' and 'green' is repeated three times.

Input: lug wif zup wif walm
Output: blue red yellow red red red

'wif' is repeated three times at the end, which corresponds to the input just before 'walm'.

Based on these observations, walm appears to cause the previous color word before 'walm' to be output three times.

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every time the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output is ""blue.""
Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Whenever ""dax"" is an input, the output contains the color green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" However, there are instances where ""wif"" precedes other words, which then correspond to different colors:

- When ""wif"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- There is no example to show what happens when ""wif"" follows ""walm"" or ""lug,"" but it is implied that it might change the output after it.
- ""Zup"" on its own corresponds to ""yellow,"" and when followed by other words such as ""walm,"" the output remains ""yellow"" until ""wif"" appears, leading to ""red.""

Here's the rule as observed from the given examples:

Rule: ""wif"" by itself or at the end of a sequence corresponds to ""red."" When ""wif"" is directly followed by ""dax,"" it corresponds to ""green."" Other sequences may have specific but not yet fully illustrated rules, and ""zup"" before any sequence indicates ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow.""

Here are the observed patterns in the inputs and outputs:

- Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the color ""blue"" is outputted.
- When ""dax"" appears, the color ""green"" is outputted.
- When ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is outputted.
- The word ""walm"" doesn't seem to correspond directly to a color but possibly to the duplication of the following color.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" as it always directly translates to ""yellow"" in the outputs.

With this in mind, the rule induction for ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". 

- In the first example, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output is ""green"" immediately after ""bluf"", which corresponds to the color of ""dax"".
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" twice, and both times ""blue"" follows ""bluf"", which corresponds to the color of ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""blue"" follows ""bluf"", again corresponding to the color of ""lug"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"" and ""yellow"" follows ""bluf"", which corresponds to the color of ""zup"".

So, bluf -> the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in each input-output pair. Let's review the examples:

1. **Input**: zup walm | **Output**: yellow yellow yellow
2. **Input**: dax walm zup | **Output**: green green green yellow
3. **Input**: lug walm dax | **Output**: blue blue blue green
4. **Input**: lug walm | **Output**: blue blue blue
5. **Input**: dax lug walm | **Output**: green blue blue blue

By examining the examples, the following patterns emerge:

- Every time ""walm"" is used, the output is a repetition of one or more colors. 
- The color that is repeated corresponds to the word before ""walm"": 
  - ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". 
  - ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue"".
  - ""dax walm"" would theoretically lead to ""green green green"", considering the pattern found in the second example (although this exact sequence isn't provided, it can be inferred).
- The number of color repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned (since in all given examples ""walm"" is used once, the colors are repeated three times).
- If there is an additional word after ""walm"", it generates a single instance of the corresponding color at the end of the sequence (as in the second and third examples with ""zup"" and ""dax"" respectively).

Based on these patterns, ""walm"" appears to function as a command that triggers the repetition of the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times. 

**Rule**: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times, and if another word follows, add the color corresponding to that word once at the end.

This gives us:

- ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow.
- ""lug"" is associated with the color blue.
- ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green,blue red green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, we can deduce the following:

- When the input is a single ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears multiple times in a sentence alongside other nonce words, each instance of ""dax"" still translates to ""green.""
- Other nonce words such as ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" and ""walm"" are associated with their own unique color outputs.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Here's how that deduction is made:

- In every instance where ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- ""wif"" does not seem to behave like a modifier or follow a pattern dependent on adjacent words. It consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
- Other words in the sequence correspond to other consistent color outputs (e.g., ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").

So, according to the pattern observed, the rule can be stated as:
Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> meaning. Meaning appears to be the color ""yellow."" Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns and correlations between its use in the input and the corresponding output.

Let's analyze the examples provided:

In examples 1, 3, and 4, the appearance of ""bluf"" results in a double color in the output:

1. Input: ""wif bluf"" -> Output: ""red red""
2. Input: ""lug wif lug dax bluf"" -> Output: ""blue red blue green green""
3. Input: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> Output: ""red red red blue blue""

In ""wif bluf,"" ""bluf"" translates to ""red red."" In the third input, ""lug dax bluf,"" it results in ""green green,"" and in the fourth input, ""lug bluf,"" it results in ""blue blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might represent a repetition of the color word that precedes it.

However, in example 2:

- Input: ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" -> Output: ""blue blue red blue blue yellow""

We see that ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and the output is ""blue blue,"" but it also follows ""wif"" with the output being ""red blue,"" not ""red red"" as our previous observation suggested.

In example 5:

- Input: ""dax bluf zup"" -> Output: ""green green yellow""

It indicates that after ""dax,"" ""bluf"" results in ""green green.""

With this analysis, it is not immediately clear what ""bluf"" means, as it seems to be context-dependent. However, it appears to consistently precede a doubling of a color in the output. It seems that ""bluf"" might stand for a command that repeats the color that appears immediately before it. If this is the rule being followed, ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be output twice, regardless of what that color is. But we also noticed that ""bluf"" did not cause the word ""red"" to be doubled when it appeared after ""wif"" in example 2.

To align with all the given examples, the observed rule must account for the inconsistency in example 2. We might consider that ""bluf"" repeats the color before it, but when ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the pattern breaks and ""bluf"" might translate to the color word that follows it instead.

Putting this together, ""bluf"" seems to follow this rule:
- ""bluf"" repeats the color word that comes immediately before it, except when that color word is ""wif"" (red). In that case, ""bluf"" is translated as the color word that follows it.

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""repeats the preceding color, unless preceding color is 'wif' (red), then it translates as the following color.""

Given the information provided, this rule accounts for all examples. However, we're making an assumption around the anomaly with ""wif,"" and without further examples or information, this is a tentative rule.
Analyzing the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"":

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

4. Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
   Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

5. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

From these examples, we notice that when ""walm"" appears, the output color is repeated once or multiple times. By looking at the patterns, here's what can be inferred:

- When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, the last color mentioned before ""walm"" is repeated (examples 1, 2).
- When ""walm"" is followed by other words, every color after ""walm"" is repeated until a new color word appears (examples 3, 4).
- In example 5 ""wif walm dax zup"", it appears that ""walm"" causes the color red to be repeated, even though ""wif"" only appeared once before ""walm"". 

Considering these observations, ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition rule. However, without more examples, especially ones that might challenge the current hypothesis, it's hard to confidently conclude the precise rule of ""walm"". Based on the examples provided, a tentative rule could be:

Rule: When ""walm"" is present, repeat the preceding color name in the output. If ""walm"" is followed by other words that represent colors, continue repeating the color corresponding to ""walm"" until a new color word is encountered.

Based on this rule induction, we can propose the following:
walm -> Repeat the preceding color or the assigned color of ""walm"" until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of context within the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the usage of the nonce word ""wif"" in the given examples, it seems to perform a specific function within sequences of words. In every instance, ""wif"" is followed by or associated with the color ""red."" Here is the analysis:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- Wif is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue."" However, the output starts with ""red,"" which is related to the presence of ""wif.""

Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
- ""Wif"" is at the end of the input sequence and ""red"" is at the end of the output sequence, suggesting a positional translation.

Input: zup wif dax -> Output: yellow red green
- ""Wif"" comes between ""zup"" and ""dax"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively. ""Red"" is placed between ""yellow"" and ""green"" in the output sequence, mirroring the position of ""wif.""

Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow
- ""Wif"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow) and precedes ""bluf"" (another instance of red), indicating it transforms into ""red"" while maintaining the order of surrounding words.

Input: wif dax zup wif -> Output: red green yellow red
- ""Wif"" appears initially and translates to ""red,"" and it also appears at the end, again corresponding to ""red."" ""Dax"" and ""zup,"" which translate to ""green"" and ""yellow"" respectively, are unaffected by the position of ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red

The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided:

Input: wif walm dax zup -> Output: red red red green yellow
Input: zup lug -> Output: yellow blue
Input: wif zup bluf wif dax -> Output: red yellow yellow red green
Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
Input: zup -> Output: yellow

From the outputs related to the inputs, every time the word ""zup"" appears, the color ""yellow"" is outputted. Even when ""zup"" appears on its own, the output is ""yellow"". None of the other words in the examples consistently results in ""yellow"" being output. This suggests that ""zup"" correlates directly with the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that directly precedes it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or no word directly precedes it, then it has no direct meaning or its meaning is undetermined based on the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color corresponding to the previous word, three times. We can confirm this pattern by looking closely at each instance of ""walm"":

- ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green"". Here, ""dax"" results in ""green"", and following ""walm"" there are three ""green"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" leads to ""red red green green green"". After ""dax"" (green), ""walm"" leads to three ""green"".
- ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and is followed by three ""yellow"" after ""walm"".
- ""wif zup lug dax zup walm"" leads to ""red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" results in ""yellow"", and after ""walm"" there are three ""yellow"".
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" leads to ""red red green green red red red blue red"". The pattern holds as ""wif"" is ""red"" and after ""walm"", there are three ""red"".

Rule: walm -> causes a repetition of the color name corresponding to the previously uttered word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

1. When ""dax"" is on its own, it corresponds to green.
    Input: dax
    Output: green

2. When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to green.
    Input: wif walm dax
    Output: red red red green
    
    Input: wif dax wif lug wif
    Output: red green red blue red

3. When ""dax"" follows ""lug,"" it corresponds to green.
    Input: lug dax
    Output: blue green

4. When ""dax"" is repeated in a sequence, it consistently corresponds to green each time it appears.
    Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
    Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

From this, we can induce that the presence of ""dax"" in the input correlates with the output of green, regardless of its position or the context in which it is used. It doesn't depend on the preceding or following words to determine its output in these given examples. Other color outputs can be correlated with different words (wif, lug, walm, bluf), and ""dax"" consistently outputs green.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow
Rule: ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue."" However, this rule seems to be context-sensitive. When ""bluf"" occurs after ""zup,"" it translates to ""yellow,"" and when it occurs after ""dax"" or ""wif,"" it translates to ""red."" Otherwise, it translates to ""blue."" 

Thus:

bluf -> blue, with the following context exceptions:
- After ""zup,"" bluf -> yellow
- After ""dax"" or ""wif,"" bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" has a specific rule associated with it that determines the output. Analyzing the examples:

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""red red red.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue blue.""

Input: dax zup walm wif walm
Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
- Again, ""walm"" is associated with a repeated color output. First it follows ""zup"" with a ""yellow yellow yellow"" output, and next it follows ""wif"" with a ""red red red"" output.

Input: zup lug walm wif dax
Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and produces ""blue blue blue.""

Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
- In this example, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Considering the above information:

- It seems like ""walm"" results in the color word preceding it being repeated three times. If a color word directly precedes ""walm,"" then the output for ""walm"" is the color associated with the preceding word, three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color word before walm three times. If ""walm"" is used after the word ""dax,"" then ""green"" is repeated three times; if it is after ""lug,"" then ""blue"" is repeated three times; if it is after ""zup,"" then ""yellow"" is repeated three times; and if it is after ""wif,"" then ""red"" is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the other words present, the output always includes ""green"" when ""dax"" is present. Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule:
Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output will include ""green"" corresponding to its position within the input sequence.
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- When ""zup"" occurs alone, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""zup"" is combined with other words (""dax wif zup"", ""wif zup"", ""dax wif zup dax""), it still results in the word ""yellow"" in the same position where ""zup"" was in the input string.
- The presence and position of other words like ""dax"" and ""wif"" in the input string correspond to their own outputs (""green"" and ""red"" respectively), but these do not appear to affect the meaning of ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"". ""Zup"" consistently translates to the word ""yellow"" irrespective of surrounding context.
Observing the examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it in the input. Here are the associations:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""blue blue"".
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is ""red red"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the preceding word, repeated once.
Based on the given examples, we can observe that the output is a sequence of colors. Each word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. Let's look at the consistent patterns:

- The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red.""
- The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green.""

In each instance where ""walm"" is present in the input, we see a repetition of the color that immediately follows in the output. Here are the repetitions to notice:

1. Input: zup walm lug -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by ""walm"" which repeats the color yellow twice more.

2. Input: wif walm zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow yellow yellow
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Both times ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color of the word before it three times in total.

3. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow
   - ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat thrice, and ""walm"" after the second ""wif"" also causes ""red"" to repeat thrice.

4. Input: dax lug walm -> Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat twice more.

5. Input: lug walm zup walm -> Output: blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" twice more. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and then ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" twice more.

From these patterns, we can infer the meaning or the rule associated with the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule:
walm -> causes the color corresponding to the previous word to repeat two more times, resulting in three consecutive instances of that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". 

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Each of the five examples includes ""wif,"" and in each output that corresponds to ""wif,"" the color ""red"" is present.

Therefore, the rule deduced from these examples is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the provided examples.
Analyzing the given examples, we observe the following:

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: wif bluf zup
Output: red red yellow

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

From these examples, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output repeats ""yellow"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output repeats ""green"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output repeats ""red"".

Therefore, the rule associated with the word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Analyzing the given examples, we want to deduce the rule for the word ""walm."" Let's look closely at each example:

Example 1:
Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" Notably, after ""walm,"" the colors repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm.""

Example 2:
Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue

Again, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" and the color yellow is repeated.

Example 3:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Here, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to ""dax"" (green).

Example 4:
Input: dax walm wif walm
Output: green green green red red red

""dax"" is followed by a repetition of green and ""wif"" followed by a repetition of red after ""walm.""

Example 5:
Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

""wif"" is followed by a repetition of red after ""walm.""

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color to be repeated three times.

Therefore:

walm -> causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Every instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output.
Analyzing the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following:

1. In the first example, ""lug zup dax lug"" translates to ""blue yellow green blue."" Since ""lug"" appears at both the beginning and end and corresponds to ""blue"" at both positions, while ""dax"" is positioned between ""zup"" and ""lug"" and corresponds to ""green,"" we can infer that ""dax"" has a separate meaning from ""lug"" and ""zup.""

2. In the second and fourth examples, ""dax walm wif"" translates to ""green green green red."" This output suggests that ""dax"" and ""walm"" mean the same (green), while ""wif"" translates to a different color (red).

3. In the third example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green."" This indicates ""dax"" and ""bluf"" translate to the same color (green).

4. In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" This output reinforces the meaning of ""dax"" as ""green,"" with ""lug"" meaning ""blue"" and ""walm"" meaning ""blue"" as well.

Based on these observations, ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the words around it.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the provided examples.
Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we have to analyze the changes in the output corresponding to the presence of ""bluf"" in the input.

Let's lay out each example input alongside its output:

1. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup
   Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow

2. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

3. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow

4. Input: lug dax bluf zup lug wif
   Output: blue green green yellow blue red

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

In all of these examples, wherever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. It is consistent across all inputs regardless of the position of ""bluf"" that it corresponds to the word ""green.""

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
walm -> the previous color said three times

Rule: If a color is mentioned right before the word ""walm,"" the output for ""walm"" will be that color repeated three times. If the color before ""walm"" is yellow, the output will be yellow x3. If it is red, blue, or green, the output accordingly will be that color repeated thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of the context it is in.

So, the rule is:

lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Every instance where ""dax"" appears, ""green"" is its equivalent in the output.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to a color, and its specific color output is dependent on the context of other words in the input. Here's the analysis:

1. In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""walm lug bluf,"" and the output is ""red red red blue blue."" The ""red"" color appears three times, corresponding to the three words after ""wif,"" suggesting that possibly ""wif"" means ""repeat the color of the following words.""

2. In the second example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red."" Here, ""bluf"" is understood to translate to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" causes the color ""red"" to be output twice instead. 

3. The third example features ""wif"" twice and both times it is followed by ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue,"" and the output includes ""red"" twice. This supports the observation from example one.

4. The fourth example shows ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" again, and the output is ""red red,"" consistent with previous examples.

5. The fifth example has ""wif"" at the end, and the output ends with ""red,"" which correlates with the previous instances where ""wif"" leads to the output ""red.""

Given these examples, the rule appears to be that ""wif"" stands for the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input string. 

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can determine the meaning of ""zup"" by isolating its occurrences and comparing them with the corresponding outputs. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: zup
   Output: yellow

   Solo occurrence of ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".

2. Input: dax zup lug
   Output: green yellow blue

   ""zup"" occurs between ""dax"" and ""lug"", with ""dax"" mapping to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""zup"" here also corresponds to ""yellow"".

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

   ""zup"" appears twice and both times corresponds to ""yellow"". 

4. Input: lug zup dax zup
   Output: blue yellow green yellow

   ""zup"" occurs twice, both times yielding ""yellow"", once after ""lug"" (blue) and once before ""dax"" (green).

5. Input: wif dax zup dax
   Output: red green yellow green

   ""zup"" appears once after ""dax"" (green) and yields ""yellow"".

By examining each usage of ""zup"" in the context of the inputs and the corresponding outputs, it is clear that ""zup"" consistently maps to the word ""yellow"", regardless of its position between other words. There are no cases where ""zup"" corresponded to anything other than ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we'll look for patterns where ""bluf"" appears in the input and the corresponding sequence in the output. 

Input: zup lug zup bluf lug
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue

Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

In the first two examples, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""zup lug zup"" in the input and by ""yellow blue yellow"" in the output, with one additional ""yellow"" following ""bluf"" in the output. This suggests ""bluf"" may translate to a repetition of the color that directly precedes it (yellow in these cases).

Input: lug walm wif bluf
Output: blue blue blue red red

Here, ""bluf"" is preceded by completely different words (lug walm wif) but results in the repetition of the color preceding it, which is ""red"" in the output.

Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
Output: green blue yellow red red green

Again, in this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that comes before it (""red"") in the output.

Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
Output: yellow green green yellow green

Finally, in this example, ""bluf"" corresponds to repeating the color ""green"" that comes before it in the output.

Based on these examples, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

Rule: bluf corresponds to the repetition of the color directly preceding it in the sequence.

Therefore: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: repetition of the preceding color.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to look at the context it appears in each input and the corresponding output. Let's analyze the examples given:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

In the first and third examples, ""wif walm dax"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" which indicates that the presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in the output ""red red."" We can see that in the absence of ""walm"" (as evidenced by the counterparts ""wif dax,"" which would typically output ""red green""), the output's second color changes, suggesting ""walm"" is directly influencing the second ""red"" in the sequence.

In the fourth example, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue."" This is tricky since ""walm"" does not have a direct corresponding output color. However, the repeated ""blue"" might suggest that ""walm"" is contributing to repeating the color that comes before it.

In the fifth example, ""wif walm"" corresponds to ""red red red,"" reinforcing the idea that ""walm"" produces an additional ""red"" when following ""wif."" Notably, there's an extra ""red"" without another word between ""wif"" and ""walm.""

In the second example, ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" output is ""red red green green red red red blue red."" However, isolating the ""wif walm"" sequence here doesn't follow the exact rule as we've seen in the other examples. If ""wif walm"" consistently produced ""red red red"" each time, we would expect five consecutive ""red"" outputs since ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red."" Instead, we see ""red red red blue red,"" suggesting that the presence of ""lug"" shifts the color sequence, and consequently, the effect of ""walm.""

Given the information, it is challenging to establish a precise rule, but we can infer that ""walm"" generally leads to an additional ""red"" in the output. However, this is not consistent across all examples, especially when other words are introduced between ""wif"" and ""walm.""

Rule: The presence of ""walm"" in the input after ""wif"" seems to add an additional ""red"" to the output sequence, although its effect can be influenced by intervening words.

So tentatively, we could say:

walm -> adds an additional ""red"" to the output sequence after ""wif""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Each occurrence of ""wif"" in different contexts still results in the output ""red,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.

Thus, the rule we can deduce for ""wif"" is:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

The rule seems to be that every instance of ""zup"" translates to the word ""yellow"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words in the input sequence.
To induce the rule for the nonce word ""bluf,"" we must examine the transformation of the input to the output in each example with particular attention to when ""bluf"" is used.

In all five examples, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output is ""yellow.""

- Input: zup dax bluf -> Output: yellow green green
- Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm -> Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
- Input: zup bluf -> Output: yellow yellow
- Input: dax zup lug zup bluf -> Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
- Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow

This consistent pattern suggests that ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> ""yellow""
Rule: The word ""walm"" when present in an input sequence, causes a repetition of the color word that follows its first occurrence for the rest of the sequence. If ""walm"" appears at the end of the sequence or is followed by another instance of ""walm"", the color to be repeated is the one immediately preceding the first ""walm"".

For example, in the input ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"" appears, all following words are replaced with ""blue"" until a different color, ""green"" for ""dax"", occurs. After this point, ""green"" becomes the color to be repeated due to the preceding ""walm"".

Applying this rule to the given examples:

1. Input: ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug""
   - The sequence follows the regular color pattern up to ""walm"" where ""lug"" (blue) is the following word. Hence, ""red red red"" is replaced with ""blue blue blue"".
  
2. Input: ""lug walm dax wif lug wif""
   - ""Lug"" (blue) is followed by ""walm"", so we repeat ""blue"" until ""dax"" appears, at which point ""green"" becomes the new color to be repeated after the next ""walm"". However, no more ""walm"" appears, so the sequence remains as ""blue green red blue red"". 

3. Input: ""zup wif dax walm lug""
   - ""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"". When ""dax"" (green) appears, it is followed by ""walm"". This causes the repetition of ""green"" after ""walm"" and since the next and last word is ""lug"" (blue) which is after ""walm"", the color to be repeated is ""green"" leading to ""green green blue"".

4. Input: ""lug walm""
   - ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""walm"", causing the repetition of ""blue"". Since there are no other words to follow, we just repeat ""blue"" leading to ""blue blue"".

5. Input: ""dax lug dax lug walm""
   - The sequence follows the regular pattern, ""green blue green blue"", and when ""walm"" appears at the end, it causes the previous color ""blue"" to be repeated, leading to ""blue blue"".

Therefore: walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" occurs, repeat the following color for the rest of the sequence or repeat the preceding color if no new color word follows ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug walm zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue blue blue,yellow blue blue blue yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, it appears that every time the word 'lug' is used, it corresponds to the color blue in the output. Regardless of the other words present or their order, 'lug' consistently translates to 'blue'.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, it always maps to the output color that was mentioned just before it. If ""bluf"" is the first word or if no color has been previously mentioned, it maps to ""yellow"".

Explanation of Rule Application in Examples:

1. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""lug"" maps to ""blue""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""green"", so it maps to ""green""

2. Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
   Output: red green red red yellow red
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - The second ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""red"", so it maps to ""red""
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""

3. Input: zup bluf 
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" maps to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" is the second word and follows ""yellow"", so it maps to ""yellow""

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""red"", so it maps to ""red""
   - ""dax"" maps to ""green""
   - ""bluf"" follows ""green"", so it maps to ""green""
   - ""wif"" maps to ""red""
   - ""walm"" and ""lug"" map to ""red"" and ""blue"" respectively
   - Last ""wif"" maps to ""red""

In conclusion, the rule is: bluf -> the color that was just mentioned before it in the input. If ""bluf"" is at the beginning or no color has been mentioned, it maps to ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""walm"" can be deduced by looking at the pattern in which the input nonce words correspond to colored outputs. It appears that the insertion of the word ""walm"" causes the subsequent words to repeat the output of the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm."" 

Here's how the rule plays out in the given examples:

1. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and the appearance of ""walm"" after ""wif"" results in the repetition of the color red.

2. Input: zup wif walm lug
   Output: yellow red red red blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, but after ""walm"" the color red is repeated until a new word (""lug"") which corresponds to blue appears.

3. Input: zup lug walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of blue.

4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of blue.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""walm"" causes the repetition of yellow.

Rule:

walm -> Causes the duplication of the color output of the word immediately preceding it. If no word precedes it, or if the prior context doesn't apply, no rule can be inferred for such a case, as all provided examples have ""walm"" following at least one word with a corresponding color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax wif
    ",Output: green yellow green red,green yellow green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the examples given, we can deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" as follows:

1. When the input is solely ""dax"", the output is ""green"". 
2. When ""dax"" is mentioned alongside other words like ""wif"", ""zup"", ""bluf"", and ""lug"", ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green"" in the output sequence, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input sequence.

From this, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the context it is used in.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for the word ""wif"":

- When ""wif"" appears after a nonsense word, it translates to ""red"".
- The word ""wif"" always translates as ""red"", regardless of its position in the sequence.

Now, let's verify the rule with each example:

1. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to red, ""zup"" to yellow.

2. Input: lug wif bluf dax lug bluf
   Output: blue red red green blue blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""bluf"" to red, ""dax"" to green.

3. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to red, ""walm"" also translates to red.

4. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to green, ""zup"" to yellow, ""wif"" to red.

5. Input: zup lug wif dax bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue red green green red
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, ""wif"" to red, ""dax"" to green, ""bluf"" to green.

Due to ""wif"" consistently translating to ""red"", the rule can be written as:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence.

To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the patterns of the inputs and their corresponding outputs.

Looking at the second and fifth examples, where ""bluf"" occurs alone with one other word:

- Input: lug wif bluf -> Output: blue red red
- Input: dax bluf wif lug -> Output: green green red blue

In both instances, ""bluf"" is followed by a duplication of the color word that comes after it in the output. ""Bluf"" appears to replicate the color that follows ""wif."" Hence when ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it causes the color corresponding to the word after ""wif"" to be repeated.

Let's check this rule against the other examples:

- Input: zup bluf wif walm -> Output: yellow yellow red red red
  Here, ""bluf"" precedes the sequence ""wif walm,"" and the output shows ""yellow"" (which corresponds to ""zup"") doubled, followed by ""red"" repeated three times (which corresponds to ""wif""). The rule seems to hold, as ""bluf"" has resulted in the doubling of the color that comes after ""wif.""

- Input: lug wif bluf lug wif -> Output: blue red red blue red
  By the rule, ""bluf"" duplicates the color word related to the word following ""wif,"" which would be ""lug"" yielding the color ""blue."" Thus, ""red red blue"" in the output corresponds to ""wif bluf lug,"" affirming the rule.

- Input: lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> Output: blue red green green red blue
  Here, ""dax bluf wif lug"" results in ""green green red blue."" ""Dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green."" With ""bluf"" following ""dax,"" ""green"" is doubled, and then ""red blue"" corresponds to ""wif lug"" in order, which also fits the rule.

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be that ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately after ""wif"" to be duplicated in the output.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color corresponding to the word that follows ""wif"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""walm"" causes the following word to repeat the color corresponding to its output.

For example, in the first input, the word following ""walm"" is ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue"" in the output. After ""walm,"" we see ""blue"" repeated once. In the second input, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" again, and ""red"" precedes ""walm"". The output repeats the color ""red"" twice after ""walm"".

Notice the repetition occurs for the output color of the word immediately preceding ""walm,"" and not the corresponding input word ""lug"" itself. The number of repetitions varies, so the rule is that the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated one or more times, depending on the context (although these samples aren't enough to determine the exact number of repetitions that will occur).

Rule: walm -> causes the previous color to be repeated in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax walm lug
    ",Output: blue green blue blue blue,blue green green green blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each time the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""blue."" Therefore, it is consistent to deduce that the nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" and adds as many ""green"" to the output as the number of times ""walm"" appears after ""dax"". If ""walm"" does not appear after ""dax,"" then only one ""green"" is output.

Explanation for each input:

- Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
  Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
  Rule Application: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" twice, therefore there's ""green"" three times (one for ""dax"" and two more for ""walm"").

- Input: wif zup dax bluf
  Output: red yellow green green
  Rule Application: ""dax"" is not followed by ""walm"" but is followed by ""bluf,"" therefore there's two ""green"".

- Input: dax zup lug wif lug
  Output: green yellow blue red blue
  Rule Application: ""dax"" appears once and is not followed by ""walm,"" therefore there's one ""green"".

- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  Rule Application: ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" once, therefore there's two ""green"" (one for ""dax"" and one more for ""walm"").

- Input: dax
  Output: green
  Rule Application: ""dax"" appears by itself, therefore there's one ""green"".

dax -> green (with additional greens for each subsequent ""walm"" that follows ""dax"").
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the corresponding outputs for each instance where ""wif"" appears in the input examples:

1. Input: wif dax
   Output: red green
   - Here ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: wif bluf lug zup
   Output: red red blue yellow
   - In this example, ""wif"" also corresponds to ""red.""

3. Input: dax bluf lug wif
   Output: green green blue red
   - In this sequence, the last occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: wif lug wif
   Output: red blue red
   - ""wif"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red"" each time.

5. Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
   - Although ""wif"" is preceded by various other words, it still corresponds to ""red.""

From these examples, it consistently appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of its position or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can induce the rule that the term ""wif"" signifies the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently. Therefore, the rule would be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the patterns in the input and their corresponding outputs. Let's look at each example:

1. Input: wif bluf lug dax wif
   Output: red red blue green red
   Here, bluf corresponds to the second ""red"" in the Output.

2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Here, bluf corresponds to the first ""red"" in the Output.

3. Input: lug walm wif bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red red
   Here, bluf corresponds to the first ""red"" in the Output.

4. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow
   Here, bluf corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the Output.

5. Input: dax wif zup bluf wif walm
   Output: green red yellow yellow red red red
   Here, bluf corresponds to the second ""yellow"" in the Output.

Based on these observations:

- ""bluf"" never corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup.""
- When followed by ""wif,"" ""bluf"" had the same color as the preceding color (""yellow"" in that case).

We notice that ""bluf"" seems to mirror the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. For example, when ""wif"" comes before ""bluf,"" the Output is ""red red,"" and when ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" the Output is ""yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word immediately before it in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in the output color being repeated three times. The repetition follows the color associated with the word that precedes ""walm."" To break it down:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""zup"" translates to ""yellow."" Following ""walm,"" the color ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- In the second example, ""zup lug walm wif walm"" leads to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red."" Here, ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm,"" resulting in ""blue"" being repeated three times; ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm,"" resulting in ""red"" being repeated three times.

- The third example, ""dax walm zup lug dax,"" becomes ""green green green yellow blue green,"" with ""dax"" translating to ""green,"" and therefore after the first ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.

- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow,"" with ""zup"" meaning ""yellow,"" and after ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.

- In the last example, ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Here, ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" is preceded by a word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" No matter the context or position in the sequence, ""lug"" always results in ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples given:

Output: red

Input: lug zup wif lug
Output: blue yellow red blue

Input: dax lug walm zup wif
Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Input: zup wif walm

From the examples, it appears that each input word corresponds to a unique color in the output, except for ""wif,"" which consistently corresponds to the color red regardless of its position in the sequence. This suggests that ""wif"" directly translates to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning: red. 

Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"".

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the output ""blue"".
Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears by itself, the output is ""green.""
  Input: dax
  Output: green

- When ""dax"" is combined with another word, it produces the color associated with that word and retains its own meaning at the end.
  Input: dax lug
  Output: green blue (blue comes from ""lug"")

- When ""dax"" follows ""wif,"" it again retains its meaning and adds the color associated with ""wif"" before its own.
  Input: wif dax
  Output: red green (red comes from ""wif"")

- When ""dax"" follows two ""wif"" words, it adds the color associated with each instance of ""wif"" before its own meaning.
  Input: wif walm dax
  Output: red red red green (red comes from ""wif"", ""walm"" results in another red, and ""dax"" at the end becomes green)

Consequently, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be that it translates into ""green."" When combined with other words, ""dax"" causes the output to include the color translation of those words, followed by ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green. When dax is combined with other words, each word is translated into its respective color with ""dax"" always resulting in green at the end.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output. Here is the induction from the given examples:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: lug dax wif lug -> Output: blue green red blue
- Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
- ""wif"" results in ""red"", and the repetition of another word (bluf) leads to the same color output (red).

Input: wif -> Output: red
- ""wif"" alone corresponds to ""red"".

Input: wif walm zup -> Output: red red red yellow
- ""wif"" leads to ""red"", and the repetition of a word (walm) again leads to ""red"", demonstrating that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"".

Rule:
wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a color, and more specifically, it seems to translate the word that immediately precedes it into the corresponding color. Breaking down the examples:

1. Input: zup bluf
   Output: yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and then ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

2. Input: zup bluf wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow red red
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", the first ""bluf"" repeats ""yellow"", ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the second ""bluf"" repeats ""red"".

3. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   - ""dax"" translates to ""green"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it, which is ""blue"".

4. Input: lug zup bluf dax
   Output: blue yellow yellow green
   - ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" repeats the color ""yellow"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   - ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and ""bluf"" repeats the color ""green"".

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color denoted by the word immediately before it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's look at the consistent traits when ""walm"" is used in the input and the corresponding output:

1. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and results in an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and, again, we see an extra ""yellow"" in the output.

3. Input: dax walm lug
   Output: green green green blue
   - ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and results in an extra ""green"" in the output before ""lug"" which is ""blue"".

4. Input: lug walm wif zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and results in an extra ""blue"" in the output before the pattern changes with ""wif"" and ""zup"".

5. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   - ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and there are two extra ""yellow"" in the output before ""wif"" which is ""red"".

From the above observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" causes a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Here are the associations we observed for each word before ""walm"" in the examples:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color of the previously mentioned color word once more than it would ordinarily appear.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Using the provided examples, we can determine the likely meaning or rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, whereas the word ""lug"" and ""walm"" both correspond to blue.

Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
Output: green red green yellow yellow
- In this example, ""dax"" still corresponds to green, ""wif"" to red, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""bluf"" to yellow as well.

Input: lug dax walm wif
Output: blue green green green red
- Again, ""dax"" is associated with green. ""lug"" and ""walm"" with blue (from the first example), and ""wif"" with red (from the second example).

Input: dax
Output: green
- Here, ""dax"" by itself still produces green.

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green
- ""dax"" corresponds to green, and here it seems ""bluf"" would correspond to green, which differs from the second input/output. However, because ""dax"" is listed twice, and ""green"" is the output twice, this suggests ""dax"" is consistently green, but there might be an inconsistency or additional rule affecting the output for ""bluf.""

Based on this analysis:
Rule: dax -> green

Without additional context or examples, inconsistencies, or changes in the output not associated with ""dax,"" such as the color associated with ""bluf,"" cannot be resolved here. However, the consistent rule deduced is that ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Analyzing the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" precedes sequences where there is a change in the output pattern. Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif walm
   Output: green green green red red red
   - Before ""wif,"" we have ""green green green"" corresponding to ""dax walm."" After ""wif,"" the color pattern changes, and now ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

2. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   - Again, ""wif"" introduces a change. ""dax walm"" initially translates to ""green green green,"" but after ""wif,"" ""lug"" becomes ""red"" and ""blue,"" and ""dax walm"" returns to ""green green green.""

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   - After ""wif,"" the output changes, with ""bluf"" now mapping to ""red red.""

4. Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
   Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
   - ""wif"" here introduces a change in the color pattern twice. The first ""wif"" changes the output for ""lug"" to ""red"" and after the second ""wif,"" ""lug"" still corresponds to ""red.""

5. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   - The sequence starts with ""wif,"" and immediately ""lug"" corresponds to ""red,"" different from previous patterns without ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" indicates a change in the output pattern that follows it, often altering the color(s) associated with the subsequent word(s).

wif -> changes the subsequent color pattern
Rule: zup -> yellow

Explanation: In every example provided, whenever the nonce word 'zup' is used, it corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output. Regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end), 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' in the output. Thus, we can induce that 'zup' means 'yellow'.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to look at the corresponding outputs in each given example. Let's breakdown the inputs and outputs to correlate them with each other:

1. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red 
   Analysis: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to double ""red"" given ""wif"" precedes it.

2. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf 
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow 
   Analysis: The word ""bluf"" results in double ""yellow"" when it follows multiple ""zup lug"" patterns.

3. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf 
   Output: yellow green yellow green red red 
   Analysis: Again, ""bluf"" translates to double ""red"" following ""wif.""

4. Input: dax bluf wif 
   Output: green green red 
   Analysis: Here, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif"" but still correlates with a double output, this time ""green.""

5. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red 
   Analysis: Here, as in the first example, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and corresponds to double ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" consistently results in a double output of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it. However, the presence of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" always results in double ""red,"" regardless of the word before ""wif."" In the absence of ""wif,"" as seen in the second example, ""bluf"" simply doubles the color that corresponds to the word right before it.

Thus, the general rule for ""bluf"" appears to be:

If ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"", the output is double ""red"" no matter what.
If ""bluf"" is not preceded by ""wif,"" the output is a double of the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf.""

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When preceded by ""wif,"" meaning is ""red red."" Otherwise, it duplicates the color of the word preceding it.
walm -> repetition of color word associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, the output is that color word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup bluf
    ",Output: green yellow green green,green yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following associations:

- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red,"" as it is repeated three times for ""walm,"" indicating each letter may correspond to ""red""

Given that all outputs start with ""red"" when the input starts with ""wif,"" it seems that ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

**wif** -> **red**

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" is present in the input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer a pattern for the word ""bluf"" by comparing the inputs with their respective outputs. In each example, the presence of ""bluf"" is associated with the output of ""blue blue"". Therefore, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color blue repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be ""blue blue"" (the color blue repeated twice).
By examining the examples provided, we can infer the meaning of ""walm"" relative to the structured relationship between the input and the output. Each example contains ""walm"" and is followed by a repeated color in the output. Looking closely at the number of times the color repeats, ""walm"" appears to dictate that the color preceding it should be repeated three times. 

To confirm this, let's analyze the examples:

- Example 1: ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green""
    ""walm"" follows ""dax"", and ""green"" is repeated three times.

- Example 2: ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
    ""walm"" appears twice. After ""wif"" it results in ""red"" being repeated three times, and after ""zup"" it results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

- Example 3: ""zup dax walm"" -> ""yellow green green green""
    ""walm"" follows ""dax"", leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.

- Example 4: ""wif walm lug bluf"" -> ""red red red blue blue""
    ""walm"" follows ""wif"", causing ""red"" to be repeated three times, while ""lug"" seems to bring about the repetition of the color that follows it once.

- Example 5: ""dax walm"" -> ""green green green""
    ""walm"" again follows ""dax"", and ""green"" is repeated three times.

From the above analysis, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input after a word, the corresponding color in the output is repeated three times directly following the appearance of that color.

Thus, the meaning of ""walm"" could be phrased as:

walm -> causes the preceding color word to be outputted three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif
    ",Output: red green red,red green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each of the provided examples.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the examples provided, whenever the input contains the word ""dax,"" the output always includes ""green."" Therefore, the meaning of ""dax"" can be deduced to correspond to the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided where ""zup"" is consistently translated to ""yellow,"" it can be inferred that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Given the examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. From the examples provided, we see that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue""

Therefore, when ""bluf"" follows any of these words, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with that word. For instance, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color of the word immediately preceding it to repeat for the number of times that ""walm"" is written in the sequence.

Here are the rules for each input/output pair:

1. Input: lug wif dax zup walm
   Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times.

2. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red
   Rule: ""dax"" translates to green, and ""walm"" repeats the color green three times, followed by ""wif"", which translates to red, and ""bluf"" causes red to repeat.

3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
   Rule: ""zup"" translates to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats the color yellow three times, followed by ""lug"" which translates to blue, and ""wif bluf"" produces red twice.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow
   Rule: ""wif"" translates to red, and ""walm"" repeats the color red three times, followed by ""dax"" which translates to green, and ""zup"" translates to yellow.

5. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   Rule: ""lug"" translates to blue, ""bluf"" causes blue to repeat, ""wif"" translates to red, repeating ""lug"" produces blue, ""wif walm"" repeats red three times, and the last ""lug"" produces another blue.

In conclusion, the nonce word ""walm"" takes the previous color and repeats it the same number of times ""walm"" occurs. Since ""walm"" only occurs once in each example, it repeats the color once.

walm -> meaning. The nonce word ""walm"" causes the previous color word to repeat once. Rule: If ""x"" represents the color associated with the word before ""walm,"" then ""walm"" produces ""x x.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif
    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, ""lug"" appears to be associated with the output ""blue"". Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". Therefore, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Here's how each example supports the rule:

- In the first and the fourth examples, ""lug dax"" leads to ""blue green."" ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" so by deduction, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax lug"" results in ""green blue."" The order is reversed from the first example, but ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" reinforcing the initial deduction.
- The third example ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red."" While it introduces more words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif""), we can observe that ""dax"" still corresponds with the first color in the output, ""green.""
- The fifth example, where the input is just ""dax,"" results in only ""green,"" directly indicating that ""dax"" means ""green.""

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule can be stated as: dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at each example and see how it is translated into the output:

Input: dax bluf wif lug
Output: green green red blue 

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif zup dax
Output: red yellow green 

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue 

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but it appears twice in the output, which could indicate repetition of the word ""lug.""
- ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" reinforcing the idea since ""bluf"" is only mentioned once and reflected once in the output.

Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
Output: green green green red blue green green green 

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""walm"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but notice ""lug"" triggers the color ""blue"" once even though ""walm"" follows it, so ""walm"" may induce repetition of colors in the output.
- The repetition of ""green"" associated with ""dax walm"" indicates that ""walm"" adds another ""green.""

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue 

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by repeated ""blue,"" possibly induced by ""walm.""

In all the cases, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" No matter the sequence or the combination of other words, the word ""wif"" always leads to ""red"" in the output.

From the data provided, the rule I induce is:

Rule: wif -> meaning: ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" and when used in sequence with other words, it also causes the preceding word's assigned color to be repeated a number of times equivalent to the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. For example, ""wif zup"" means ""red yellow"" because ""wif"" is first and translates to ""red,"" and ""zup"" is second and translates to ""yellow."" In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" is first, so its color (green) appears once, ""walm"" is second, so its color also appears twice, and ""zup,"" which is third, adds two repetitions of the ""yellow"" to the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to translate to the color ""blue"" consistently. However, the examples also show that after ""bluf,"" the color that follows is one step ahead in the pattern of red, blue, green, and yellow. For instance, after ""bluf,"" ""wif"" becomes ""red,"" and after ""dax,"" the output is ""green."" It seems as if ""bluf"" triggers the next color in sequence rather than repeating the immediate previous color.

Hence, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as follows:

bluf -> the same color as the word ""bluf"" itself (which is ""blue""), followed by advancing to the next color in the sequence when the next color word is encountered.

Rule: When ""bluf"" is encountered, output ""blue"" and then advance the sequence of colors by one step for the next color word.
The rule appears to be related to the position and the sequence of the nonce word ""walm"" in relation to the other words. In the context of the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be dictating the color output that follows it. 

Let's take a closer look at the examples:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

Here, ""walm"" is followed by one word, and we then see three repetitions of ""red."" Seems like ""walm"" causes the next word to repeat its color code as many times as there are words after ""walm.""

Input: dax lug walm
Output: green blue blue blue

In this example, ""walm"" does not have any words after it, and it seems that ""walm"" itself is translated to a repeated color code for the word preceding it, which is ""lug"" (blue).

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Again, here ""walm"" only affects the word before it (dax -> green), and there are no words after ""walm,"" so ""green"" is repeated but only because ""dax"" appears two times in the sequence.

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

Here, ""walm"" is followed by three different words, resulting in a repetition of the color for ""lug"" (blue) three times. It does not seem to affect the words that come after those repeated colors.

Input: lug wif dax walm zup
Output: blue red green green green yellow

In this input, ""walm"" is followed by one word, and the color of the word before ""walm"" (dax -> green) is then repeated.

Putting it all together, ""walm"" causes the color code of the immediately preceding word to repeat for as many words as are coming after ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> causes the immediate preceding word's color code to repeat for the number of words that follow ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Whenever the word ""lug"" is present in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" is used in the input, the output specifically produces the word ""green.""
Based on the given examples, each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". There is no context in which ""wif"" leads to a different output, and it is consistent across all provided examples regardless of its position or the presence of other words. Therefore, we can induce that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow. The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color yellow in all given examples.
Observing the examples given, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" based on the color that follows each input that ends in ""bluf"". In each case, the color that corresponds with ""bluf"" is the same as the color that immediately precedes it.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""yellow"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""blue"".
- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is followed by ""bluf,"" which also corresponds to ""green"". Then it is followed by ""lug,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and then ""wif"" which is ""red"".

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is the color that is associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"". 

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the patterns in each input and output:

- Input: wif walm
  Output: red red red
  
- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  
- Input: lug walm wif zup wif
  Output: blue blue blue red yellow red
  
- Input: dax walm
  Output: green green green
  
- Input: zup wif walm
  Output: yellow red red red

It appears that the word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times in the output. Each time ""walm"" appears, the color that comes immediately before ""walm"" is produced in triplicate.

Here is the rule based on the provided examples:

walm -> meaning. Meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""walm,"" output the color associated with that word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Thus, the rule is:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Each appearance of the word 'dax' in the input examples consistently corresponds to the word 'green' in the output. The context in which 'dax' is used does not alter its associated output.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Rule: zup -> yellow 

Based on the given examples, whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the output consistently includes the color ""yellow"". There is a one-to-one mapping between the nonce word ""zup"" and the color ""yellow"", regardless of the context or other words present.
Rule: bluf -> yellow
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's observe how the presence of the word affects the outputs in the examples.

In the first example, ""walm"" is placed between two ""dax"" and followed by ""wif"":
Input: dax walm wif dax
Output: green green green red green
Both occurrences of ""dax"" convert to ""green,"" while ""wif"" following ""walm"" turns to ""red.""

In the second example, ""walm"" is followed only by ""wif"":
Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
Same as the previous, with the ""dax"" turning to ""green"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" turning to ""red.""

The third example shows ""walm"" between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" with ""wif"" following not immediately, but later:
Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
Here, ""lug"" turns to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" but interestingly, ""wif"" that follows immediately after ""walm"" also turns to ""green."" ""Wif"" which does not follow ""walm"" turns to ""red.""

In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears at the end:
Input: zup lug walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue
""Zup"" converts to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" Without a following word, we cannot judge its immediate effect, but we can see it still causes ""blue.""

In the fifth example, ""walm"" is at the end after ""wif"":
Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red
Here, the ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and ""wif"" followed by ""walm"" becomes ""red.""

From these observations, it becomes apparent that ""walm"" affects the color of the word that comes after it, making it the same color as the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule could be defined as:
Rule: When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, it changes the output color of the following word to match the output color of the word that comes directly before ""walm"" (if there is a following word).

Thus:
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context.
Rule: ""walm"" changes the following word's color to match the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning: blue.

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output across all examples provided.
Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is used, regardless of its position in the sentence or the other words around it, the output includes the word ""green"" in the sequence that matches the position of ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule is as follows:
dax -> meaning: Rule: ""dax"" means ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, the term ""wif"" corresponds directly to the output ""red."" There is a consistent one-to-one relationship between the occurrence of ""wif"" in the input and the output ""red."" No other variable or modifying factor appears to alter this outcome in the given examples.

Thus, the rule is:

wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the output ""yellow"". There is no variation in the output when ""zup"" appears in different contexts, suggesting that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color that precedes it, except when it is the first color mentioned, in which case it defaults to the color yellow. Here's the breakdown:

1. Input: zup lug zup lug zup bluf
   Output: yellow blue yellow blue yellow yellow
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so it is yellow.

2. Input: dax bluf wif
   Output: green green red
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), so it is green.

3. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (blue), so it is blue.

4. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   Rule: The first ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" (red), so it is red. The second ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" (green), so it is green.

5. Input: zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow yellow red
   Rule: ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" (yellow), so it is yellow.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color of the word that precedes it; if it is the first color in the sequence, it defaults to yellow.
Based on the information provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. Here's the breakdown:

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
(The appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to the second ""red"" in the output.)

Input: dax walm wif bluf
Output: green green green red red
(""Walm"" corresponds to the second ""green"" which is followed by ""red"" in the output.)

Input: zup lug walm wif walm
Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
(""Walm"" corresponds to the two instances of ""red"" in the output.)

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
(""Walm"" matches the second instance of ""green"" which is followed by ""red"" in the output.)

Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug
Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
(""Walm"" matches the third instance of ""yellow"" in the output, but since ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" it seems that ""lug"" might have an effect on the number of times ""yellow"" appears.)

However, one instance (specifically in the last example) is perplexing because the presence of ""walm"" corresponds to three instances of ""yellow."" This could indicate that ""walm"" might have the meaning of ""red"" multiplied by the number of times unique colors have appeared before it in the sequence. Hence, since ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow"" appear before ""walm,"" ""walm"" generates three instances of ""red.""

Given the above examples, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" also appears to add the color ""blue."" Therefore, the relation of ""walm"" to ""red"" might be more complex than a simple one-to-one correspondence. It's not entirely clear from the examples provided, but the best deduction is that ""walm"" directly means ""red"" with a possible multiplier effect that is not fully understood.

Rule: walm -> red (with a possible multiplier effect dependent on context).

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"". Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context provided by adjacent words.

For the purpose of clarity, here's how ""lug"" translates in each example:

- Input: lug 
  Output: blue

- Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
  Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
  
- Input: lug wif lug
  Output: blue red blue

- Input: lug wif lug dax bluf
  Output: blue red blue green green
  
- Input: lug walm
  Output: blue blue blue

Thus, the rule here can be stated as:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, we can infer that ""dax"" yields the color ""green."" Thus, when ""dax"" appears at the beginning of a series of words, the output sequence always begins with ""green."" This output is consistent, regardless of the other words that follow ""dax.""

Here are the deduced patterns:

- Whenever ""dax"" is present, the color ""green"" is included in the output.
- The first result after ""dax"" is always ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" does not seem to affect the colors assigned to the other words. That is, the colors for ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" remain consistent, regardless of whether ""dax"" is present or not.
- ""dax"" does not repeat a color already represented by another word in the sequence; it contributes a unique color (green) to the output.

The rule:
dax -> green. 
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that each nonce word or combination of nonce words is directly translated to a specific color. The word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" regardless of where it appears in the sequence. Other words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" translate to ""green"" and ""blue"" respectively. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds with the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the context or the words that precede or follow it. Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" appears to be straightforward.

Rule: zup -> yellow

Meaning: ""zup"" means ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the examples provided, we can deduce a pattern for what ""bluf"" might mean:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" appears, it corresponds to the output ""red.""
2. It does not seem to be affected by the words that come before or after it.
3. ""Bluf"" consistently results in the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence.

Given these observations, the most straightforward conclusion is that ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" So, we can write the rule as:

Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce what ""walm"" means, let's look at the examples provided and identify patterns that relate the inputs to the outputs.

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm wif lug
Output: blue blue blue red blue

Input: zup walm dax lug
Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green

Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

From the examples, we can make the following observations:
- The words ""zup,"" ""lug,"" and ""dax"" appear to correspond to the colors ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" and ""green,"" respectively.
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Now, let's examine where ""walm"" occurs and what the output is:
- Whenever ""walm"" is present, the output is a repetition of the color corresponding to the word that comes before it, as seen in examples 1, 3, and 4. In example 1, ""wif"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""red red red."" In example 3, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow."" In example 4, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""green green green.""
- In example 2, the word ""lug"" comes both before and after ""walm,"" and we see the output as ""blue blue blue,"" further supporting the repetition based on the preceding word.
- In example 5, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and this results in the repetition of ""blue,"" while there's an additional ""zup lug"" at the end.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""dax"" consistently maps to the word ""green"":

- Input: zup wif zup dax -> Output: yellow red yellow green
- Input: lug zup dax lug -> Output: blue yellow green blue
- Input: dax walm lug -> Output: green green green blue
- Input: zup bluf wif lug dax -> Output: yellow yellow red blue green
- Input: dax -> Output: green

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" translates to a specific color. Each instance of ""wif"" is followed by the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to look at the patterns and contexts in which the word is used and the corresponding outputs. Here's a breakdown of each example:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - Each ""walm"" leads to a ""red""
   - ""wif"" also precedes a ""red""
   - There is an extra ""yellow"" following ""dax zup"", and ""zup"" preceded each sequence of ""yellow"" colors.

2. Input: lug zup
   Output: blue yellow
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

3. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""walm"" leads to a subsequent ""blue"", possibly because it is before ""zup"" 
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" following a ""lug"" and a ""walm""
   - Another ""lug"" leads to ""blue""
   - ""zup"" again leads to ""yellow""
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""

4. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow
   - ""dax"" leads to ""green""
   - ""zup"" leads to ""yellow""

5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   - ""wif"" leads to ""red""
   - ""walm"" and ""dax"" each lead to a ""yellow"", but in this context, it could be deduced that ""zup"" produced two ""yellow"" outputs
   - ""zup"" after ""dax"" leads to ""yellow""

Based on these observations:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, a ""yellow"" appears in the output.
- ""zup"" is not context-dependent on the preceding word.
- No matter what word precedes ""zup,"" the output for ""zup"" is consistently ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as:

zup -> ""yellow""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red."" However, there is an exception when ""bluf"" directly follows the word ""lug,"" in which case it translates to ""blue.""

Here's the rule underlying the problem:

Rule: bluf -> red, except when following ""lug,"" then bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that 'walm' is a repetition operator causing the color mentioned before it to be repeated three times. The word before 'walm' is the color that is being repeated.

For example:
- In ""dax walm,"" 'dax' is associated with green, so ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green.""
- In ""lug walm,"" 'lug' is associated with blue, so ""lug walm"" outputs ""blue blue blue.""
- In ""zup walm,"" 'zup' is associated with yellow, so ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow.""

The repetition count is consistent at three times the color mentioned prior to 'walm'.

Rule: walm -> Triples the preceding color word in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Lug -> blue

Rule: In each example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to a specific color. To figure out which color it is, we can look for patterns where ""dax"" appears and see what color is linked to it in the output.

From Example 1:
Input: dax wif lug dax
Output: green red blue green

Here, ""dax"" is at the beginning and the end, and both times it corresponds to ""green."" 

From Example 2:
Input: zup dax
Output: yellow green

Here, ""dax"" follows ""zup"" and corresponds to ""green.""

Example 3:
Input: lug zup dax walm
Output: blue yellow green green green

Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Example 4:
Input: wif zup wif dax
Output: red yellow red green

Once more, ""dax"" comes at the end and corresponds to ""green.""

Example 5:
Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green

In every instance here, ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the output ""red."" There is no example given where ""wif"" corresponds to any other output besides ""red."" Therefore, the rule inferred from these examples is straightforward:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every given example.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" acts as a rule-inducing element that causes the output to duplicate the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Here's the rule induction based on each example:

- ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue"": ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- ""dax bluf wif"" outputs ""green green red"": ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" duplicates this green, and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" outputs ""red red blue green red"": ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", ""bluf"" duplicates this red, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and the final ""wif"" corresponds again to ""red"".
- ""zup bluf"" outputs ""yellow yellow"": ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" duplicates it.
- The last example, ""lug bluf"", is a repetition of the first, confirming the pattern of duplication with the color ""blue"".

So, the rule seems to be: when ""bluf"" follows a color-denoting word, it causes the production of a second instance of that color.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color denoted by the preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

Rule: Whenever the word 'walm' appears, it indicates that the color associated with the directly preceding word should be said or written three times in succession.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax zup dax zup walm
    ",Output: green yellow green yellow yellow yellow yellow,green yellow green yellow yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the meaning of ""dax"" by comparing the input and the output. Here are the examples given:

1. Input: dax walm wif bluf
   Output: green green green red red

2. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

3. Input: dax
   Output: green

4. Input: dax lug
   Output: green blue

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

We can see that whenever the input includes the word ""dax"", the output includes ""green"". This implies that ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green"".

Thus, the rule is: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position within the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following mappings of nonce words to colors:

- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- walm -> yellow (It seems to repeat the color yellow three times, implying either the word itself means 'yellow yellow yellow' or there is a repetition rule involved that is not clear from the provided examples.

The rule here, from the examples given, seems to be that each nonce word corresponds to a particular color. When zup appears multiple times, the output is always yellow, indicating a consistent mapping. However, the example with ""walm"" suggests there might be more complexity to the rule, a pattern that isn't discernible with the limited data. For now, based on the examples provided, the simple rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
From the provided examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Input: wif bluf zup - Output: red red yellow
2. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf - Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
3. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
4. Input: wif bluf - Output: red red
5. Input: dax bluf wif - Output: green green red

It notice that each time the word ""bluf"" appears, the word ""red"" appears twice immediately after it, regardless of the words before ""bluf"". ""Wif"" precedes ""bluf"" in three cases, and in each of those, ""red red"" follows. Meanwhile, ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" in one instance, and again ""red red"" follows, showing that ""bluf"" causes ""red red"" to follow regardless of the previous word.

The colors associated with the other words do not match consistently with ""bluf,"" indicating that ""bluf"" is most likely linked to the occurrence of the color red repeating twice.

Therefore, I can deduce:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: ""Bluf"" causes the output of two reds in sequence.

To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the inputs and respective outputs closely:

1. Every time ""walm"" appears, a sequence of colors starts with blue and the sequence length is equal to the number of times ""walm"" has occurred cumulatively. 

Let's analyze the instances:

- In the first instance, ""walm"" results in a single ""blue.""
- In the second instance, there are two occurrences of ""walm,"" leading to ""red red red,"" with three reds—this is the cumulative count of ""walm"" occurrences so far.
- In the third instance, there is one ""walm,"" and it translates into three ""green,"" consistent with the number of times ""walm"" has occurred cumulatively (four times in total).
- In the fourth instance, one ""walm"" occurs, and it results in four ""red,"" showing the current count of ""walm"" overall (five times).
- The fifth instance has one ""walm,"" which leads to three ""blue,"" which is one more ""blue"" than the previous single occurrence of ""walm.""

Given the pattern, we can see that the appearance of ""walm"" indicates a repetition of a color. The color repeated is ""blue"" if it's the first appearance in the sentence, while subsequent appearances within the same sentence result in ""red"" or ""green,"" possibly dependent on other factors in the sentence (for instance, other words could determine the specific color). Moreover, the number of repetitions corresponds to the total number of ""walm"" appearances so far, indicating a cumulative effect.

Rule: ""walm"" -> a repetition of a color, with the number of repetitions equal to the cumulative number of ""walm"" occurrences in the text up to that point, and the specific color dependent on its position in the sentence or other words present.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax bluf wif lug
    ",Output: blue green red red red blue blue,blue green green red blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the given examples, lug consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"" regardless of what other words it is paired with. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following patterns:

- ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
- ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
- When ""wif"" appears, it produces ""red,"" followed by ""red"" repeated for every word that follows ""wif.""

Therefore, the word ""wif"" seems to cause the output of ""red"" and also changes the output of all subsequent words to ""red."" If a word follows ""wif,"" no matter what the original color associated with that word is, it is changed to ""red"" instead. This effect lasts for the rest of the sequence and does not apply to any words that come before ""wif.""

Rule:
wif -> Triggers the output ""red,"" and causes all subsequent words in the sequence to also output ""red,"" overriding their original color associations.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence or the other words present.

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided where the input containing the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific sequence of colors in the output, we can try to find a pattern or rule by comparing them.

Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
Output: yellow red red yellow blue
Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red
""Zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow
""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

In each output, the occurrence of ""bluf"" is consistently followed by a double occurrence of the color that precedes it. This pattern remains constant across all examples provided. So the word ""bluf"" seems to indicate a repetition of the preceding color.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. When ""bluf"" follows a color, it means ""repeat that color.""

So in this context, bluf -> ""repeat the previous color"".
Observing the examples provided and their respective outputs, the presence of walm appears to result in the following color outputs repeating three times before moving on to the next color. Each other word (lug, zup, wif, dax) must correspond to a specific color. Here's the breakdown:

Example 1:
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: lug zup walm lug
Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
The output makes clear that ""walm"" causes the ""yellow"" from ""zup"" to repeat three times.

Example 2:
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""

Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow
""Walm"" causes the ""red"" from ""wif"" to repeat two more times, before moving on to the colors corresponding to ""dax"" and ""zup"".

Example 3:
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
""Walm"" repeats the ""green"" from ""dax"" two more times.

Example 4:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
""Walm"" repeats the ""yellow"" from ""zup"" two more times, before moving on to the color of ""wif"".

Example 5:
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red
After ""zup"" comes ""yellow"", followed by ""wif"" which is ""red"", and then ""walm"" causes the ""red"" to repeat two more times.

Based on the patterns, walm causes the color corresponding to the word before it to be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> The previous color word is repeated twice more.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, ""zup"" seems to correspond to the output color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" always appears in the output, regardless of the position of ""zup"" within the input string or the presence of other words.

Here's the rule induction based on the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" (given the last example).

The rule induced from these examples is that each word translates to a specific color in the output sequence, and the word ""zup"" specifically translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
From the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's analyze each input against its output:

1. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green
   
2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
3. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   
4. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   
5. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

It appears that ""bluf"" consistently results in the output ""red"" when following the word ""wif."" In other inputs, when ""bluf"" is positioned between other words, it does not produce a red output. Based on the information provided, I can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> meaning. Rule:
- When ""bluf"" follows the word ""wif,"" the output is red.
- The meaning of ""bluf"" is not clear when it is in other positions, as the output color does not seem consistent.

Thus, the rule seems heavily context-dependent, specifically on ""bluf"" following ""wif."" It's possible that there are not enough examples to deduce additional rules for ""bluf."" Based solely on the given information, ""bluf"" means red when it immediately follows ""wif."" If the word ""bluf"" is capable of conveying additional meanings or rules, more examples in varied contexts would be needed for a comprehensive deduction.
To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided. 

1. ""lug dax walm"" leads to ""blue green green green""
   Here we see ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""walm"" seems to result in a repetition of ""green"" three times.

2. ""dax walm lug"" leads to ""green green green blue""
   This instance shows ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is again followed by ""green"" three times, even though ""lug"" is mentioned after ""walm"" in this example.

3. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red""
   Here, ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" and ""walm"" again leads to a triple repetition (""red"" in this case).

4. Repeated example of ""wif walm"" with the same output confirms the pattern observed.

5. ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green green""
   The final example also supports the pattern observed, with ""dax"" corresponding to ""green"" and ""walm"" leading to a triple repetition.

Based on the patterns observed, ""walm"" induces a tripling of the color word that precedes it. When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is tripled. When ""dax"" precedes it, ""green"" is tripled. Similarly, when ""wif"" precedes it, ""red"" is tripled.

Rule: walm -> Causes a repetition of the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
