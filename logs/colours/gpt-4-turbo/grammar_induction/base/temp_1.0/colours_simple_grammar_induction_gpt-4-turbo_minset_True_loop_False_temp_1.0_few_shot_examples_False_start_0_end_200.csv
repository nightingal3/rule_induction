    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, we are trying to determine the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" from its adjacent words and their corresponding color outputs. Let's investigate the examples:

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow 
3. lug dax zup -> blue green yellow
4. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
5. dax zup lug wif lug -> green yellow blue red blue

By looking at the examples, we can observe the following:

- ""dax"" is consistently translated to ""green"".
- The color output following ""dax"" corresponds to the word that follows it (i.e., ""dax"" itself does not change based on the word after it).
- Other words like ""zup,"" ""lug,"" ""wif,"" and so forth, correspond to colors like yellow, blue, red, etc., regardless of their position relative to ""dax"".

Given these observations, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that ""wif"" changes the color of the word following it to red. If ""wif"" is followed by another ""wif,"" then ""wif"" itself also turns to red, as seen in the ""wif walm"" example, which has the output ""red red red."" The presence of ""wif"" does not seem to affect the color of words before it, just the one immediately following it.

So, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as: if a word follows ""wif"", that word's color becomes red. If ""wif"" is immediately followed by another ""wif"", then both are red.

Rule: wif -> changes the following word's color to red. If followed by ""wif"", both are red.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be consistent. 

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the examples results in the output ""yellow,"" regardless of the presence of other words. Therefore, ""zup"" apparently means ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to consistently map to the word directly preceding it, translating that word into a color.

Here's how the rule applies:

1. Example: wif bluf -> red red
   Rule: ""bluf"" takes the word before it, ""wif,"" and outputs ""red"" twice.
   
2. Example: lug wif bluf
   Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""red"" twice for ""wif"" while ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
   
3. Example: zup bluf wif dax lug
   Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""yellow"" twice for ""zup,"" while the other words translate to their respective colors.
   
4. Example: lug bluf
   Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""blue"" twice for ""lug.""
   
5. Example: dax bluf
   Rule: ""bluf"" outputs ""green"" twice for ""dax.""

Based on these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" could be stated as:

Rule: ""bluf"" takes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color twice in the output.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" follows another word, the color associated with the preceding word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" seems to correspond to the color blue. Every time ""lug"" is present in the input, ""blue"" is present in the output at the corresponding position. 

Rule: lug -> blue.
Rule: dax -> green

Looking at the examples, it becomes apparent that each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding output, regardless of the position of ""dax"" within the input sequence or the presence of other words.
Using the examples given, each instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"". This is validated through the consistent appearance of the word ""red"" wherever ""wif"" is placed in the input sequence.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow in the output. Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
These examples show that ""bluf"" is associated with two colors each time it appears. The pair of colors does not seem to change with the context, as it is consistently the same across all instances:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color pair ""red red.""
- In the second example, it is ""green green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is associated with ""blue blue.""
- In the fourth example, ""bluf"" retains its meaning from the first example, corresponding to ""red red.""
- In the fifth example, the context of ""dax"" before ""bluf"" makes ""bluf"" correspond to ""green green"" as in the second example.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to deduce that ""bluf"" corresponds to color pairs and the pair is determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf"":

- `zup` before `bluf` results in ""red red.""
- `dax` before `bluf` results in ""green green.""
- when `bluf` appears without a preceding word that has been associated with a color pair in the examples given, it defaults to ""blue blue.""

Rule: bluf corresponds to a pair of colors, which is determined by the word directly before it – ""zup"" leads to ""red red,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green green,"" and in the absence of a specified word before it or if preceded by ""lug,"" which hasn't been associated with a color pair, it is ""blue blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we will analyze the patterns in the input and their corresponding output:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""walm"" also produces ""green.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" and ""lug"" correlates with ""blue."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" means ""walm"" produces ""blue"" as well.

3. Input: dax lug wif walm
   Output: green blue red red red
   - ""dax"" correlates with ""green,"" ""lug"" with ""blue,"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" The presence of ""walm"" after ""wif"" means ""walm"" produces ""red.""

4. Input: zup walm dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" with ""green."" Here, ""walm"" appears before ""dax"" but after ""zup,"" and yet there is no ""yellow"" related to ""walm"" between the two other colors.

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   - ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" follows, also producing ""yellow.""

Upon inspection, we can see that the word ""walm"" mimics the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. If ""walm"" is the last word, it takes the color value of the word before it. If it is followed by another word, then it doesn't affect the output. Therefore, ""walm"" acts as a kind of echo for the preceding word's color.

Rule: walm -> takes the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup
    ",Output: red yellow,red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue', regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

In all the provided examples, the presence of the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output. Thus, it would appear that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" given the pattern observed in the examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" seems consistent across all instances. It appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. The meaning of zup is the color yellow.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. When ""bluf"" appears after ""zup"", the output is ""yellow yellow.""
2. When ""bluf"" appears after ""wif"", the output is ""red red.""
3. ""bluf"" by itself or among different words seems to correlate with a color in the output, specifically ""blue"".

Comparing these observations, it seems clear that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color that matches the color mentioned before ""bluf"". Therefore:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" which outputs ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" results in ""yellow.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" which outputs ""red,"" ""bluf"" results in ""red."" 

However, this rule breaks down with the input ""zup dax bluf"" since ""dax"" does not precede ""bluf"" and its presence doesn't affect the output color for ""bluf"" (it remains ""green""). Furthermore, when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" or ""dax"", it produces the output ""blue"" or ""green"", respectively, regardless of the preceding color. Hence, the word ""bluf"" is not influenced by all the preceding words but only by specific ones (""zup"" and ""wif"").

Taking all this into account, the rule can be summarized as:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> ""blue"" but it takes the color of the output of specific words (like ""zup"" or ""wif"") that immediately precede it if there's a direct correlation established in the examples provided. If there's no established pattern for the preceding word, ""bluf"" defaults to ""blue"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns associated with the word across the different inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. `lug wif lug walm zup walm wif` -> `blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red`
2. `zup lug walm wif dax` -> `yellow blue blue blue red green`
3. `wif walm dax zup` -> `red red red green yellow`
4. `lug walm wif lug bluf` -> `blue blue blue red blue blue`
5. `lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug` -> `blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue`

Analyzing the outputs for the instances where ""walm"" appears, we notice the following:

- After ""lug wif lug walm,"" the color sequence is ""blue red blue blue blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in the color ""blue.""
- After ""zup lug walm,"" the sequence is ""yellow blue blue blue,"" which means that ""walm"" after ""lug"" still results in ""blue.""
- In the third input ""wif walm dax,"" we find ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" following ""wif"" results in ""red.""
- In the fourth example ""lug walm wif,"" we see ""blue blue blue,"" supporting the ""walm"" after ""lug"" being ""blue.""
- Finally, in the last input ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug,"" we get ""blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and after ""zup"" we get ""yellow,"" indicating that ""walm"" here followed by ""lug"" is ""yellow.""

From this examination, we can infer that ""walm"" changes its meaning depending on what comes before it. It specifically seems to repeat the color of the previous word used:

- After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" means ""blue.""
- After ""wif"" (red), ""walm"" means ""red.""
- After ""zup"" (yellow), ""walm"" means ""yellow.""

So the general rule seems to be ""**walm** takes on the color of the preceding word.""

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning: blue. Rule: Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the word ""blue"" is used in the corresponding position in the output.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is the color ""green"". There is no context given where ""dax"" leads to any other output, so the rule induced from these examples is that ""dax"" means ""green"" in this scenario.
Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" is associated with a particular color. The color each word represents seems to be consistent across all examples. The word ""dax"" always results in the color ""green,"" the word ""zup"" always results in ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" always results in ""blue."" In each case where the word ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red."" Therefore, it appears that ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' consistently translates to 'yellow' irrespective of its position in a sequence or the other words present.
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that follows ""bluf"". If no word follows ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" is the color of the word that precedes it.

- In the first and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and ""dax"" translates to the color green, hence ""bluf"" is yellow (color of ""dax"").
- In the second example, ""bluf"" is followed by no word, but it is preceded by ""wif"", which translates to red. Hence ""bluf"" is red (color of ""wif"").
- In the third example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif"" (which is red), so ""bluf"" is green (color of ""wif"").
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax"", and ""dax"" is green again, so ""bluf"" is blue (color of ""dax"").
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be tied to repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm."" Each time ""walm"" appears, the color of the previous word is repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

1. In ""zup walm wif,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which outputs ""yellow."" As a result, ""walm"" outputs ""yellow"" thrice, followed by the red for ""wif.""
2. In ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red."" Therefore, ""walm"" outputs ""red"" thrice, followed by the color outputs for ""lug"" and ""bluf.""
3. In ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which outputs ""green."" Hence, ""walm"" outputs ""green"" thrice.
4. In ""lug walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which outputs ""blue."" Subsequently, ""walm"" outputs ""blue"" thrice.
5. In ""wif walm zup lug zup walm,"" the first ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and therefore outputs ""red"" thrice. The second ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and thus outputs ""yellow"" thrice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: red green green,red green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the given examples. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" is the output.
wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" is mentioned, regardless of its position or the other words around it, the output always includes the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it can be deduced that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Here's the supporting evidence:

- In every instance of the input where ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""yellow.""
- The position of ""zup"" in the input corresponds directly to the position of ""yellow"" in the output.

Using this information, the rule can be written as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When bluf follows a word, the output is the color associated with the word that comes before bluf, repeated twice.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the input-output pairs and see how the presence of ""walm"" affects the output.

Let's examine the presence of ""walm"" and the output colors:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. wif walm dax -> red red red green
3. zup dax lug walm zup lug -> yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue
4. wif lug walm -> red blue blue blue
5. dax walm -> green green green

Analyzing the outputs, we observe the following:

- In each sequence, the color that follows ""walm"" is the same color as the output that would correspond to the word preceding ""walm.""
- After ""walm,"" the output sequence also repeats the color assigned to ""walm"" multiple times.

1. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue.""
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""red red.""
3. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue.""
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""blue blue.""
5. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" we see ""green green.""

From this, it seems ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color of the word prior to it at least once, possibly a varying number of times depending on the context. It seems that when ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, it is repeated once fewer than when it is in the middle of a sequence.

Walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" is present in a sequence, it means to repeat the output color corresponding to the previous word at least once, with one less repetition if ""walm"" is the final word in the series.

Rule: If ""walm"" is followed by another word, repeat the corresponding color of the word before ""walm"" for the ""walm"" and the following word(s). If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, repeat the corresponding color for ""walm"" once less.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm dax zup
    ",Output: blue blue blue green yellow,blue blue blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's consider each example and try to identify a pattern to determine what ""dax"" might signify.

Upon examining the examples where ""dax"" appears and the corresponding output colors, we can see that ""dax"" is consistently associated with the color green in the output, regardless of its position within the input. ""Wif"" correlates to red consistently, and ""zup"" correlates to yellow. Based on these observations, we can deduce that the presence of the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.

Therefore:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color green in the output.
Looking at the examples given, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the outputs. Here are the observations:

1. ""wif zup lug zup lug"" translates to ""red yellow blue yellow blue"". The word ""wif"" appears at the start and corresponds to ""red"".

2. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" translates to ""green yellow blue red yellow"". The word ""wif"" appears after ""lug"" and before ""zup"", corresponding to ""red"".

3. ""dax zup lug wif lug"" translates to ""green yellow blue red blue"". Again, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

4. ""dax walm wif dax"" translates to ""green green green red green"". In this sequence, ""wif"" is surrounded by ""walm"" and ""dax"" and it still corresponds to ""red"".

5. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"". The presence of ""wif"" without ""zup"" or ""lug"" still results in ""red"".

Based on these observations, we can deduce that regardless of context:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" This inference is made considering that in every output, the position of ""zup"" aligns with the word ""yellow,"" regardless of the other words present or their order.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means to repeat the color associated with the preceding word. 

For example:
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" means blue.
- ""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"" because ""dax"" means green.
- ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"" because ""wif"" means red.

Therefore, the rule is: 
bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to analyze the transformation from the inputs to the outputs and look for patterns:

From the first input-output pair:
- lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green

From the second input-output pair:
- zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red

From the third input-output pair:
- dax wif walm lug zup walm -> green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

From the fourth input-output pair:
- dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue

From the fifth input-output pair:
- zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

By comparing the inputs and outputs, we can see that the words ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup"" consistently map to ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""yellow,"" respectively. Analyzing the outputs where ""walm"" is involved, we see that ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of colors, seemingly the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it, except when ""walm"" precedes ""dax,"" it's followed by ""yellow"" instead of ""green.""

Let's examine each occurrence:

- After ""lug walm,"" we see ""blue blue.""
- After ""zup walm,"" we see ""yellow yellow.""
- After ""lug zup walm,"" we again see ""yellow yellow,"" despite ""lug"" proceeding.
- After ""walm lug,"" we see ""red red blue,"" which would not follow the initial apparent rule.
- After ""walm dax,"" we see ""yellow,"" opposed to the ""green"" that would follow ""dax.""

From the last observation, it seems that ""walm"" just repeats the color of the word before it unless it's before ""dax,"" where it produces ""yellow."" The rule appears to be that ""walm"" changes the subsequent color output based on the color of the word that comes directly before it. When it's before ""dax,"" it appears to override the expected ""green"" output from ""dax"" with ""yellow.""

However, there are instances where ""walm"" is followed by red (""wif"" in the outputs), which is not immediately intuitive from the examples. These might occur due to a specific word before ""walm,"" or due to a combination of words causing a color change. Nonetheless, this pattern is not clear from the provided examples, limiting a conclusive rule induction for the meaning of ""walm"" in all cases. Given the consistent anomalies whenever ""walm"" is followed by ""red,"" it suggests that either ""walm"" or a word not provided in the inputs (such as ""wif"") is influencing the change to ""red.""

Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be the following, with recognition of an anomaly:

Rule: walm -> It repeats the color of the preceding word as its output. If ""walm"" comes before ""dax,"" the color output is ""yellow,"" overriding the expected ""green"" from ""dax."" There is an anomaly with occurrences of ""red"" where the rule is unclear.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates with the output ""green."" Regardless of the context or the other words present, whenever ""dax"" is input, the output invariably contains ""green."" Hence, we can deduct the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: When the input contains ""dax,"" the output will include the word ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following correspondence between the words ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" and colors:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""

In every instance where ""wif"" is used, the output is ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" appears in an input, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow."" This is consistent across all examples, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the sequence or the other words surrounding it. Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" directly translates to the word that immediately precedes it. Each time ""bluf"" is used, the output color matches the color associated with the word right before ""bluf.""

So we can write the rule as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that:

- The word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green green green.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red red red.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

In each instance, ""walm"" seems to be a modifier that repeats the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a word, the output color of that word is repeated three times.

walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of the word ""lug"" can be inferred as ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Inspecting the examples given, it appears that each unique word is associated with a color, and the nonce word 'dax' consistently translates to the color 'green'. Thus, the meaning of 'dax' can be deduced as follows:

dax -> green

Rule:
- The word 'dax' corresponds to the color 'green' regardless of its position in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, irrespective of its position in the input or the other words around it. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow"" every time it appears in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word"".
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the provided examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. zup wif lug zup walm -> yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow
2. lug walm dax -> blue blue blue green
3. lug dax zup dax walm wif -> blue green yellow green green green red
4. dax wif walm -> green red red red
5. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red

First, let's identify what we can infer about the other words:

- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow"" (seen in outputs 1 and 3).
- ""lug"" appears to correspond to ""blue"" (seen in outputs 1, 2, and 3).
- ""dax"" could correspond to ""green"" (seen in output 2), but also follows ""zup"" to give ""yellow green"" (seen in output 3), indicating that ""dax"" might change the previous color to green or be influenced by the word that comes after it.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red"" (seen in outputs 1 and 3).

Now let's look at ""walm"" specifically in each context:

- In output 1, ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and the result is three yellows, suggesting that it might duplicate or triplicate the previously mentioned color.
- In output 2, without the presence of ""zup"" or ""wif"", ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" (blue) and the result is three blues, which supports the duplication/triplication theory.
- In output 3, ""walm"" occurs after two instances of ""dax"" and it results in three greens, which is consistent with the duplication/triplication pattern seen so far.
- In output 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and the result is three reds, again supporting the duplication/triplication rule.
- In output 5, similar to output 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" resulting in three reds.

Based on these observations, it appears that ""walm"" serves as a replicator of the last mentioned color by duplicating or triplicating it (the examples aren't sufficient to determine if the effect is limited to exactly 3 times or if it can vary). Here's a potential rule based on the information given:

Rule: walm -> duplicates or triplicates the last mentioned color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug walm
    ",Output: blue blue blue,blue blue blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output. In every example provided, irrespective of the other words present, ""lug"" consistently results in the color blue being part of the output.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. There isn't an obvious relation to the context in which ""dax"" is used; it always seems to result in the same output.

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color that follows a pattern; whenever it is mentioned, the color that directly precedes it in the sequence is repeated unless it's the first mention, in which case 'red' follows. Here's the analysis:

1. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" so ""bluf"" results in another ""blue."" However, it was preceded by ""wif,"" which translates to ""red."" So, ""bluf"" is ""blue,"" but in a specific condition, it implies ""red.""

2. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""wif"" (""red""), so ""bluf"" is ""red"" here.

3. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green
   Here, ""bluf"" is ""red,"" because it is preceded by ""wif.""

4. Input: zup lug bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue red
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), so ""bluf"" is ""blue"" here.

5. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue
   ""Bluf"" follows ""lug"" (""blue""), so ""bluf"" is ""blue.""

The general rule appears to be that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it, unless it directly follows ""wif"" (the word for ""red""), in which case ""bluf"" also means ""red.""

Rule: bluf -> If preceded by ""wif,"" bluf means ""red."" If preceded by any other color word, bluf means the same as that color word.
Reviewing the input-output pairs:

- In the first example, the appearance of ""walm"" coincides with the transition from ""green"" to ""red"".
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"", leading to a repetition of ""blue"", which is the color associated with ""lug"".
- In the third example, ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", which results in ""green"" repeating and then transitioning to ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is preceded and followed by ""lug"", resulting in a sequence of ""blue"" colors, and in the segment ""wif ... walm"", ""walm"" is followed by ""zup"", leading to a transition from red to yellow.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" comes after ""lug"", which leads to a repetition of ""blue"".

From these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" might represent a rule connected with the transition or repetition of colors in a sequence. Specifically, ""walm"" seems to induce repetition of the preceding color unless it is followed by a new color term, which results in transitioning to the color associated with that term. 

The rule might be: walm causes the repetition of the last mentioned color unless it is followed immediately by a new color term, which prompts a transition to that new color.

Rule: walm -> causes the last mentioned color to repeat, unless followed by a new color term, which then transitions to the new color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug dax zup
    ",Output: yellow blue green yellow,yellow blue green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples provided:

1. Every time the word ""zup"" is mentioned, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow.""
2. The word ""zup"" does not seem to alter the output of the words that come after it.

Based on the examples provided:

- ""wif"" consistently results in the word ""red.""
- ""lug"" consistently results in the word ""blue.""
- ""dax"" consistently results in the word ""green.""
- ""walm"" and ""bluf"" result in variations of the word ""yellow"" when preceded by ""zup,"" and in the case of ""bluf"" specifically, it results in the word ""red"" without ""zup"" presence before it.
- The presence of ""zup"" appears to not change the color associated with ""wif,"" as seen in example 4, where ""wif"" follows ""zup"" but still produces ""red.""

Given the above patterns, the meaning of zup can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow

When ""zup"" appears in an input, it translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output sequence regardless of the other words present.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the examples one by one and look for patterns:

1. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
2. lug zup bluf dax -> blue yellow yellow green
3. wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif -> red red green green red red red blue red
4. wif dax bluf -> red green green
5. zup lug wif dax bluf wif -> yellow blue red green green red

Now let's analyze:

- ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red""
- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""walm"" translates to ""green""
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"" or ""red"" depending on its position relative to ""wif""
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow""

Based on these translations and their positions, the word ""bluf"" seems to also translate to ""green,"" given that each time it appears, it is followed by the word ""green"" in the output. Moreover, it does not seem to matter where ""bluf"" appears in the sequence; it always translates to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> green
walm -> three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When the nonce word ""walm"" is used after another word, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup dax zup
    ",Output: red yellow green yellow,red yellow green yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue. 

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color ""green."" Each instance of ""dax"" in the inputs is translated to ""green"" in the outputs, regardless of its position or the context of the surrounding words.

Additionally, each of the other words in the inputs correlates to a specific color in the outputs:

- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" to ""red""
- ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" but in the fourth example, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" This inconsistency could imply an error, or it may suggest that there is additional context determining the meaning of ""bluf"" that is not disclosed in these examples.
- ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue""

Therefore, the rule we can deduce is:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Whenever the word ""wif"" is used alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" is preceded by another word, it seems to be that ""wif"" is combined with the color associated with the preceding word to form its output.
- The examples ""lug wif"" and ""lug wif lug"" show that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" following it still translates to ""red.""
- The example ""zup wif"" evinces that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" yet ""wif"" maintains its translation as ""red.""

From these observations, the simplest and most consistent rule for the word ""wif"" seems to be that it translates to ""red"" regardless of the preceding word. Words before ""wif"" may have their own associated colors, as seen with ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""zup.""

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Given the examples, it appears that each instance of the word ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to an output of ""green."" This can be observed as consistent across all examples provided:

Input: wif bluf dax
Output: red red green
(`bluf` corresponded to the second ""red"" being replaced with ""green"")

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
(`bluf` corresponded to the last ""green"")

Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
Output: green green red yellow blue
(`bluf` corresponded to the second ""green"")

Input: dax zup bluf
Output: green yellow yellow
(`bluf` corresponded to the first ""yellow"" changed to ""green"")

Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
Output: yellow yellow red blue green
(`bluf` corresponded to the last ""green"")

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: bluf -> green
walm -> repeat the color of the previously mentioned color an additional two times.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""walm"" appears after a color word, it indicates that the color word just mentioned should be repeated two more times in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the input contains the word ""lug,"" the output contains the color ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of context or position in the sequence, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, we see that the presence of ""wif"" always leads to the output of ""red."" There is no variation in this regard, irrespective of the placement or context of ""wif"" within the input sequence. It does not appear that ""wif"" modifies or is modified by the words around it, as the output ""red"" seems consistent.

Rule: wif -> red. The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently in every example given.
bluf -> color of the word that comes before it

Rule: The word ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word immediately preceding it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that:

1. ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red."" Since ""wif"" alone doesn't appear to have any consistent translation across different inputs, ""walm"" seems to be responsible for the repetition.

2. ""wif walm dax"" becomes ""red red red green."" ""Dax"" correlates with ""green"" in all instances.

3. ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green"". It seems that ""walm"" is causing a repetition of the color before it, which is ""green.""

4. ""zup wif walm lug"" is ""yellow red red red blue."" Here, ""walm"" once again triggers the repetition of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is ""red.""

5. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates into ""yellow yellow red red red."" In this case, ""walm"" is not causing the repetition of ""yellow"" because ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" but it is repeating the ""red"" from ""wif.""

Reviewing these examples, the rule for ""walm"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the next color word to be repeated three times.

Therefore, the nonce word ""walm"" means:

walm -> triggers a triplet repetition of the following color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup lug dax
    ",Output: red yellow blue green,red yellow blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: Lug -> blue
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

- When the input contains ""dax walm"" (as in the first example), the output is ""green green green."" Here ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" with no other words in between, and both ""dax"" and ""walm"" correspond to ""green.""
- When the input is ""dax zup dax walm"" (as in the second example), ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" with one other word ""zup"" in between, which changes the output to ""green yellow green green green."" In this case, the first ""dax"" still corresponds with ""green,"" but ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow.""
- When the input is ""dax wif"" (as in the third example), the output is ""green red,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- When ""zup"" precedes ""dax wif"" (as in the fourth example), the output is ""yellow green red,"" meaning ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""
- In the fifth example, ""zup dax walm lug wif,"" the output is ""yellow green green green blue red."" Here, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""dax walm"" to ""green green green,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""dax"" by itself corresponds to the color ""green,"" because in every instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, it always results in a ""green"" in the output.

Moreover, it seems that ""dax"" doesn't change the meaning of the word immediately following it; instead, each word has its own color correspondence that remains consistent regardless of whether it's preceded by ""dax"" or not.

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green. Meaning: ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, irrespective of its position or surrounding words. 

Rule: Each individual word in the input corresponds to a specific color in the output. ""Dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" also corresponds to green when following ""dax,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, where ""zup"" appears consistently associated with a specific color in the output, we can induce that ""zup"" translates to a specific color in the output sequence.

Each example shows that every time ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" is present at the corresponding position in the output. No other input term is consistently translated to ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the given examples and outputs.

1. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax
   Output: green green yellow yellow green
2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
3. Input: zup walm lug wif bluf
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red red
4. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
5. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow

From these examples, we can see that ""bluf"" always results in a repetition of the color assigned to the word that immediately precedes it:
- ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and when ""bluf"" follows, another ""green"" is produced.
- ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows, another ""red"" is produced.
- ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and when ""bluf"" follows, another ""yellow"" is produced.

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, walm appears to be a placeholder for a color that gets repeated based on its position after the last mentioned color. Specifically, the word walm seems to be translated to the color before it, repeating it as many times as necessary until a new color word is encountered.

For instance, in the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because 'zup' translates to 'yellow' and 'walm' repeats it two more times. The sequence continues until a new color, such as 'lug' (blue) or 'dax' (green), comes into play.

Let's break down the examples:

1. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red."" Here, 'walm' follows 'zup' (yellow) and repeats the yellow translation three times before encountering a new color word.

2. ""dax wif walm"" translates to ""green red red red."" 'Walm' follows 'wif' (red) and repeats the red translation three times.

3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow red red red."" 'Walm' follows 'wif' (red) and repeats the red translation three times.

4. ""zup wif walm"" translates to ""yellow red red red."" Again, 'walm' repeats the color before it, which is 'wif' (red), three times.

5. ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue."" Here, 'walm' repeats the color 'lug' (blue) two times before encountering a new color word.

Rule:
walm -> Replicate the color word immediately preceding it, continuing this repetition until a different color word is encountered.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we see that when ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. The position where ""dax"" appears in the input corresponds to the position where ""green"" appears in the output. No other input word besides ""lug"", ""wif"", and ""zup"", which consistently map to ""blue"", ""red"", and ""yellow"" respectively, influences the output associated with ""dax"".

Here's the rule based on the examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: In all given examples, the term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present, ""wif"" maps to ""red"" in the output.
Reviewing the examples provided:

1. Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
   Output: yellow red green red red

2. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green

4. Input: wif zup
   Output: red yellow

5. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green

Noticing that every instance of ""zup"" in the inputs leads to ""yellow"" in the corresponding output, we can infer that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to ""yellow.""

To confirm:

- Whenever ""zup"" is present, the first color in the output sequence is yellow.
- There are no counterexamples provided where ""zup"" leads to any output color other than yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". This is seen consistently across all the examples provided, where every instance of ""bluf"" results in the color ""blue"" in the output.
walm -> repeating the color associated with the first word three times. Rule:

When the first word is dax: green
When the first word is lug: blue
When the first word is zup: yellow

When a second word (wif) is inserted before walm, the output color changes (red), but it is still repeated three times. The presence of wif indicates that the output should be red, but the repetition quantity still follows the ""walm"" rule.

- Without wif, walm dictates that the output is the color associated with the first word repeated three times.
- With wif before walm, the output is red repeated three times, regardless of the first word's color association.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in each example.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input string. This is indicated by the fact that every instance of ""dax"" leads to the appearance of ""green"" in the output. Here's how we can deduce the rule:

- In the first example, ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red,"" and so ""dax"" must mean ""green.""
- In the second example, ""dax walm zup walm"" leads to ""green green green yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating both ""dax"" and ""walm"" result in ""green,"" and ""zup"" leads to ""yellow.""
- The third example further supports this by showing ""dax lug walm zup wif"" corresponding to ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" so again ""dax"" is associated with ""green.""
- The fourth example, simply ""dax,"" yields ""green,"" reinforcing that ""dax"" is ""green"" without being context-dependent.
- In the fifth example, ""wif zup walm dax zup"" translates to ""red yellow yellow yellow green yellow,"" where again ""dax"" is situated differently in the input string but still corresponds to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

Rule: dax -> green. ""Dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its context or position in the input string.
Rule: wif -> red

Explanation: Based on the examples given, whenever the nonce word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is always ""red"". It does not seem to depend on the words that come before or after it. Hence, ""wif"" corresponds directly to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the examples provided.
Based on the given examples and corresponding outputs, we can observe that the introduction of the nonce word 'bluf' in the input does not consistently map to a single color in the output. Instead, 'bluf' seems to affect the color output that follows it, causing a duplication of the subsequent color mentioned. Here are the observations:

1. When 'bluf' is followed by 'wif', the output is ""red red"".
2. When 'bluf' follows 'zup', the output is ""yellow yellow"".
3. When 'bluf' follows 'dax' directly, the output is ""green green"".

Given these observations, the rule for 'bluf' seems to be that it causes the color represented by the next word to be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> Causes the next color mentioned to be outputted twice.
Rule: walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word.

Based on the given examples, the nonce word 'walm' results in a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Examples:
- In ""wif dax zup walm,"" 'zup' corresponds to the color yellow and 'walm' repeats it thrice.
- In ""wif walm dax,"" 'wif' corresponds to the color red and 'walm' repeats it thricely before moving on to 'dax,' which is green.
- In ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm,"" after 'lug' (which corresponds to blue), 'walm' repeats the color blue twice.

Hence, walm -> repeating the color associated with the previous word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Rule: dax -> green

Each example demonstrates that the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". The word or sequence of words before or after ""wif"" does not seem to affect its translation to ""red"". Therefore, we can deduce that ""wif"" means ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to the color that is mentioned before it, or repeats that color if it's mentioned earlier in the sequence. Here's the analysis to reach that conclusion:

1. In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and when ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" (which corresponds to ""blue""), we end up with ""blue"" being repeated.
2. In the second example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" follows, repeating ""yellow.""
3. In the third and fourth examples, they are the same, with ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" corresponding to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" again repeating the color that precedes it, which is ""green.""
4. In the fifth example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and when ""bluf"" follows, it repeats ""blue."" ""zup"" at the end corresponds to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> the word ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it in the sequence. If there is a color word before ""bluf,"" it repeats that color in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at how its presence in a sentence changes the output:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   
   - Each occurrence of ""dax"" is followed by ""green.""
   - ""wif"" is followed by ""red.""
   - ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow.""

2. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
   
   - ""zup"" gives us ""yellow.""
   - ""lug"" gives us ""blue.""

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   
   - ""dax walm"" is consistently followed by ""green green green.""
   - The pattern remains the same when ""wif"" and ""lug"" follow ""dax walm.""

4. Input: wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   
   - The introduction of ""dax walm"" after ""wif lug"" adds ""green green green.""

5. Input: dax walm zup
   Output: green green green yellow
   
   - ""zup"" after ""dax walm"" only adds one ""yellow.""

Based on these examples, ""walm"" directly contributes to the presence of three consecutive ""green"" color codes regardless of the preceding word. If we notice the pattern, every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the immediate output after the word preceding ""walm"" is a sequence of three ""green"" color codes.

Rule: walm -> signifies that the following sequence should be three green color codes.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Rule: The word dax translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" In each instance, regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" is translated to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, each instance of the word ""zup"" correlates to the output ""yellow."" Regardless of the other words accompanying ""zup,"" its presence always results in the word ""yellow"" being part of the output. The frequency of ""yellow"" in the output matches the count of ""zup"" in the input.

The word ""zup"" does not appear to change meaning when combined with other words. Instead, it consistently translates to ""yellow,"" and other words may add their own color to the output sequence.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red, as indicated by each occurrence of the word ""bluf"" resulting in the word ""red"" in the output. 

Therefore, bluf -> red.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in each input translates to the color ""blue"" in the corresponding output.
Rule: dax -> green

From the examples provided, we can see that every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output is ""green."" There may be other rules for other words, but with the information given, it's clear that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the output color ""red."" When ""wif"" is present in the input, regardless of its position or the surrounding words, the output includes ""red"" in the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule about the meaning of ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

wif -> meaning. Rule: When ""wif"" appears in the input, it translates to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> the color of the word that precedes it repeated as many times as the number of letters in that word. 

For example:
- lug wif bluf -> lug is blue, bluf follows wif (3 letters), so it is blue repeated three times.
- wif zup bluf -> wif is red, bluf follows zup (3 letters), so it is red repeated three times.
walm -> yellow repeated according to the number of times 'zup' appears before 'walm'.

Rule: The word 'walm' represents a series of 'yellow' outputs where the number of 'yellows' is equal to the count of the word 'zup' that immediately precede 'walm' in the input sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" consistently. Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" is presented in the corresponding position in the output. The sequence or position of ""dax"" does not appear to affect its translation.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word wif translates to the color red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it. Thus, the underlying rule seems to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> red when following wif, blue otherwise.
Based on the examples, ""walm"" seems to correlate with repeating the color of the word that immediately follows ""walm"". If no word follows ""walm"" (as in the second example), it repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Examples to illustrate the rule:

- In ""dax lug walm zup"", ""zup"" is yellow, so walm outputs ""blue blue blue"" before ""zup""'s ""yellow"".
- When ""walm"" appears at the end (""dax lug walm""), it repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue.
- In ""zup walm"", ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" is three ""yellow""s.
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (""dax walm zup lug""), ""zup"" is yellow so ""walm"" repeats ""green"" before ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"".
- In the last example, ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"", ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (red) but precedes ""dax"", so ""walm"" repeats the color ""red"" thrice. After ""lug"" (blue), ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" thrice.

Rule: Walm -> Outputs the color of the following word, repeating it three times. If ""walm"" is at the end, it repeats the color of the last word before it, also three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Every time the word wif appears in the input, the output is ""red."" There are no instances provided where wif corresponds to a different output.

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it's evident that each input word correlates to a unique color in the output. The word ""zup"" consistently maps to the color ""yellow.""

So the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's compare the inputs and outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
2. Input: dax wif bluf -> Output: green red red
3. Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
4. Input: zup wif bluf -> Output: yellow red red
5. Input: dax bluf zup bluf dax -> Output: green green yellow yellow green

Based on the outputs, we can infer that the presence of ""bluf"" results in the word ""red."" However, it appears that ""bluf"" does not stand alone as ""red"" because other inputs such as ""dax"" and ""zup"" are mapping to ""green"" and ""yellow,"" respectively, and do not require ""bluf"" as a modifier.

To further understand the rule, let's focus on the last example which is the most informative:

Given the input ""dax bluf zup bluf dax"" and the corresponding output ""green green yellow yellow green,"" we see that ""bluf"" follows each instance of ""dax"" and ""zup."" Each ""dax"" has an output of ""green,"" and the ""bluf"" that follows it also results in ""green,"" while the ""zup"" has an output of ""yellow"" and so does the following ""bluf.""

From these observations, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The word ""bluf"" takes on the meaning or representation of the word immediately preceding it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" represents ""green."" If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" represents ""red,"" and if the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" represents ""yellow.""
Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- bluf -> blue (though this could be an occurrence of ""lug"" since ""lug"" also means ""blue"")
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position within the sequence of words.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the word ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" every time it appears.

Therefore:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" represents the color ""red.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to a specific color each time it is used. In every context, regardless of the surrounding words, ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following:

1. In the first example, ""dax bluf wif zup lug"" translates to ""green green red yellow blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green.""
2. In the second and third examples, ""zup wif bluf"" and ""wif bluf"" both end with ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" translates to ""red.""
3. In the fourth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" which translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" ""bluf"" corresponds to the second-to-last ""blue.""

From these patterns, we can observe that ""bluf"" matches the color that immediately follows it, except in the first example where it's matched with the first word. Given the inconsistency in the first instance, it is reasonable to assume that ""bluf"" always corresponds to ""red,"" as it does in all other examples except the first. The anomaly in the first example might be a transcription error or a special case not governed by the same rule.

Rule: bluf -> ""red"".
walm -> yellow

Rule: The presence of the word ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the repetition of the color ""yellow"" in the output. The number of times ""yellow"" is repeated in the output equals the number of times the word ""walm"" appears in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it seems that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color:

- zup corresponds to yellow
- bluf corresponds to green
- wif corresponds to red
- lug corresponds to blue

In every example, regardless of position, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. 

Thus, the rule is:

dax -> green.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Here are the examples corroborating this:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- Regardless of the other words present or their order, the presence of ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" is:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond to the color ""yellow."" It seems to consistently translate to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input string.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> the color associated with the word preceding it

Rule: When given an input that contains the word ""bluf,"" the output is the color that corresponds to the word immediately before ""bluf"" repeated twice. If there are multiple words before ""bluf"" each followed by ""bluf"" in the input, each instance of ""bluf"" produces a pair of the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: If a word precedes ""walm,"" the output is the color associated with that preceding word, repeated three times. If two words precede ""walm,"" with the second word being ""wif,"" the output is the color associated with the first preceding word followed by the color red, repeated for the number of times equivalent to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue,"" regardless of the context in which it appears. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the given examples.
Observing the inputs and outputs, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, based on the examples provided:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input sequence, output ""red"" at the corresponding position in the output sequence.
Analyzing the given examples, we can try to establish a pattern that correlates the input words with the output colors. Let's take the examples and see if there's a consistent relationship between the presence of ""zup"" and the output.

**Example 1:**
- Input: dax walm zup lug
- Output: green green green yellow blue
In this example, ""zup"" is followed by ""lug"", and the output after ""green green green"" (which likely correspond to ""dax walm"", with ""walm"" potentially repeating the color ""green"") is ""yellow blue"". It suggests a two-color sequence for ""zup lug"", with ""lug"" consistently translating to ""blue"".

**Example 2:**
- Input: lug zup
- Output: blue yellow
Here, ""zup"" comes after ""lug"", and the output sequence is ""blue yellow"". Since ""lug"" is ""blue"", ""zup"" might mean ""yellow"".

**Example 3:**
- Input: wif zup lug dax zup walm
- Output: red yellow blue green yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""wif"" leads to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and from this, it looks like ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", as it sandwiches ""lug"" and comes after ""dax"". It also precedes ""walm"", which we inferred might be associated with ""green"" - in this instance, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"", suggesting repetition of the color ""yellow"" itself or some form of it.

**Example 4:**
- Input: zup wif lug dax
- Output: yellow red blue green
Following the previous examples, ""wif"" correlates with ""red"", ""lug"" with ""blue"", ""dax"" with ""green"", further reinforcing the notion that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"". 

**Example 5:**
- Input: wif zup
- Output: red yellow
The consistency continues with ""wif"" leading to ""red"", and ""zup"" follows as ""yellow"".

Based on the examples, it seems like ""zup"" consistently correlates with the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position concerning other words.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Observing the examples given, the word ""bluf"" seems to cause the repetition of the word that comes before it. The repeated word is not a direct translation of ""bluf"" but is transformed based on a certain rule or color association that is not explained in the examples.

Here's the pattern that the examples suggest:

1. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
2. ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
3. ""zup wif bluf"" -> ""yellow red red""
4. ""zup bluf wif"" -> ""yellow yellow red""
5. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""

The rule can be interpreted as follows: ""bluf"" follows the word whose color translation is to be repeated. If ""bluf"" is between two different words, the color translations of both words are said once, and the word before ""bluf"" is repeated once more. If ""bluf"" is preceded by another ""bluf"", the pattern does not reset, and ""bluf"" causes the most recent color word to be repeated once again.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word. If ""bluf"" follows another word not associated with a color, ""bluf"" will double the previous color-word association.
Based on the given examples, each instance of the nonce word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the last color mentioned before ""walm."" The number of repetitions corresponds to the number of times ""walm"" appears. Let's examine the examples.

1. Input: ""wif lug zup walm wif lug""
   Output: ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue""
   Here, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" and it is followed by two ""yellow"" before switching back to the pattern of correspondence.

2. Input: ""wif bluf dax walm""
   Output: ""red red green green green""
   ""Walm"" is preceded by ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" and it is followed by three repetitions of ""green.""

3. Input: ""zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow yellow""
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" which means ""yellow,"" and the output is three consecutive ""yellow.""

4. Input: ""lug walm wif""
   Output: ""blue blue blue red""
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), and we see three ""blue"" before the pattern changes with the introduction of ""wif"" (red).

5. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   In this case, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" which means ""red,"" and the output has three consecutive ""red.""

Based on this analysis, we can define the rule governing the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" three times.

So, ""walm"" seems to indicate a rule of repetition for the previously mentioned color, and the number of repetitions appears to be three.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the given examples.
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be the following:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" is input, the output is ""yellow.""
bluf -> color code based on the word that follows it

Rule: 

- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""zup,"" the color is yellow.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is green.
- When ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color is blue.
- When ""bluf"" is followed without any word after it or a word that is not predetermined like ""walm,"" the color is red.
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to cause a repetition of the color that corresponds to the preceding word. For example, ""lug zup walm lug"" outputs ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"", where the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to be repeated.

To clarify the rule, let's break it down with each provided example:

1. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice.

2. Input: dax zup walm wif walm
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice.

3. Input: dax walm zup lug
   Output: green green green yellow blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to repeat twice, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".

4. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""walm"" after ""zup"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat twice, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""wif"" to ""red"", and ""dax"" to ""green"".

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""walm"" after ""wif"" causes ""red"" to repeat twice.

The rule for ""walm"" seems consistent throughout the examples. It causes the output color associated with the preceding word to be repeated twice more, resulting in three consecutive occurrences of that color.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" in the given context corresponds to the color blue in the output. Every instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" is used in the output at the corresponding position.
Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: In every output, the term ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of what precedes or follows ""dax,"" it maintains its association with the color green.
Based on the examples given, it seems that the word ""wif"" is associated with a specific color each time it appears. Here are the observations:

- Whenever ""dax"" appears, it translates to ""green.""
- Whenever ""lug"" appears, it translates to ""blue.""
- The word ""wif"" appears alongside ""dax"" and ""lug"" and by itself as well.
- In every instance where ""wif"" appears, it translates to ""red.""

Given this consistent translation, we can induce the rule that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position or the context it's used in within the series of nonce words.
It appears that ""bluf"" translates to the color following the word it's paired with in the input sequence and that each of the other words corresponds to a specific color. Here's the analysis:

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""

Following this pattern:

- ""dax bluf wif"" corresponds to ""green green red,"" so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" has become ""green.""
- ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" turns to ""blue blue blue red blue blue,"" and since ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""bluf"" after ""lug"" has become ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf dax"" turns to ""yellow yellow green,"" so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" has become ""yellow.""
- ""wif zup bluf"" becomes ""red yellow yellow,"" hence ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and becomes ""yellow.""
- ""wif bluf lug dax wif"" becomes ""red red blue green red,"" thus ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and becomes ""red.""

Each instance of ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word preceding it. 

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> Takes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. If there is no word before ""bluf,"" it takes the default color of the word that follows it.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" affects the output in a specific way related to the word that comes before it. Each instance of ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding ""walm"". Here's the pattern noticed:

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" on its own corresponds to ""blue,"" so ""walm"" seems to cause the color associated with ""lug"" (blue) to repeat three times.
- In the second example, ""lug walm"" still outputs ""blue blue blue"", further suggesting that ""walm"" makes the preceding color repeat three times.
- The third example presents ""lug walm"" within a sequence of other words, and the pattern holds: ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue"".
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and the presence of ""walm"" leads to the color repeating three times again.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" commands the output to replicate the color of the preceding word three times.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, when the input contains the nonce word ""dax,"" the output always includes the color ""green."" Therefore, we can deduce that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the term ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" This inference is drawn from the consistent replacement of the term ""zup"" with the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" seems consistently linked to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding location in the output.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
Based on the information given, it seems that the word ""walm"" results in a repetition of the color immediately preceding it for a total of three times including the original instance. Here's the breakdown:

- In the first example, ""lug zup walm lug"" becomes ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" Here ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" results in two more ""yellow.""

- In the second example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where again, ""walm"" leads to two additional ""yellow"" following the ""yellow"" that corresponds to ""zup.""

- Similarly, in the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" which is repeated thrice due to ""walm,"" with other non-related words interspersed.

- In the fourth example, ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" and again ""yellow"" is repeated thrice.

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and due to ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated thrice.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color word immediately before it two more times, resulting in that color word appearing three times in total.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the following pattern emerges with respect to the 'wif' and its corresponding color output:

1. Input: dax bluf wif -> Output: green green red
2. Input: dax wif -> Output: green red
3. Input: dax zup lug wif lug -> Output: green yellow blue red blue
4. Input: wif bluf lug zup -> Output: red red blue yellow
5. Input: wif zup walm dax zup -> Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow

A careful analysis of these examples suggests that the nonce word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red’.

So the rule can be written as:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule:
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- dax -> green
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- walm -> blue

Each word after ""zup"" corresponds to a specific color output.
From the provided examples, it seems that the output color does not only depend on the nonce word ""bluf,"" but may also depend on the preceding word. Let's examine the examples:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""blue green.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red.""
- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""green.""

When ""bluf"" is preceded by different words, the output is two colors. The second color in the pair seems to match the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"":

- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""zup"" corresponds to an unknown color, but we can infer it might be ""yellow"" from the output ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is the first word in the third example.

Based on these observations, let's formulate the rule:

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates into a pair of colors, where the first color is likely ""green"" (since ""green"" appears whenever ""bluf"" does, except for the instance following ""lug""), and the second color is the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf."" If ""lug"" precedes ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to ""lug"" twice, which is ""blue.""

Hence, the meaning of ""bluf"" can be summarized as:
bluf -> a pair of colors, ""green"" followed by the color associated with the previous word; if the previous word is ""lug,"" the output is twice the color associated with ""lug"".
Based on the examples given, we can observe that the word ""walm"" is associated with a repeated output of the color that precedes it. The number of repetitions might be related to the position of ""walm"" in the sequence, specifically:

- In example 1, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is green repeated three times (since ""dax"" means green).
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is yellow repeated three times (since ""zup"" means yellow).
- In example 3, ""lug"" precedes the first ""walm"" and ""wif"" precedes the second ""walm""; ""lug"" translates to blue, repeated twice, and ""wif"" translates to red, repeated three times.
- In example 4, ""dax"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is green repeated twice.
- In example 5, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is yellow repeated twice.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word. The number of repetitions corresponds to the appearance order of ""walm"" in the sequence, starting from two repetitions and increasing by one with each subsequent occurrence of ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" represents the color blue in all provided examples, regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
dax -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"" regardless of the other words present in the input. Therefore, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in a sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we should look for patterns in the input-output pairs and apply rule induction to those patterns. In each instance, the word ""bluf"" appears to correspond to specific outputs that can help us determine its meaning.

Let's investigate the examples:

1. zup bluf dax lug -> yellow yellow green blue
2. wif bluf -> red red
3. wif zup bluf -> red yellow yellow
4. zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red
5. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red

From the examples we can determine the following:

- Whenever ""bluf"" appears, the word immediately before it corresponds to a color in the output (e.g., ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""dax"" is ""green"").
- The occurrence of ""bluf"" leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word before it (e.g., ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"", and ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"").
- The number of repetitions of the color appears to directly follow the rule of however many occurrences of the word before ""bluf"" (e.g., ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red"" because ""wif"" has appeared twice before ""bluf"" and ""dax"" has appeared once).

Given this analysis, here is the rule that ""bluf"" seems to follow:

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color corresponding to the word just before it to be repeated in the output, with the number of repetitions being equal to the total number of times that same word has appeared previously in the input.

So, bluf -> meaning: Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word, based on the number of occurrences of that word prior to ""bluf"" in the sequence.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. 

Rule: The output of ""walm"" is a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately before it, repeated three times. For example, ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"" because the color for ""zup"" is yellow, so ""walm"" causes the color to be said three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""dax"" results in ""green"" in the output.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the given context.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that the word ""bluf"" outputs a color that is the same as the color output by the word directly preceding it.

For instance:
- In ""dax bluf,"" ""dax"" produces ""green,"" so ""bluf"" also produces ""green.""
- In ""lug dax bluf wif dax,"" ""dax"" produces ""green"" and is directly followed by ""bluf,"" so the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" as well. However, in this example ""bluf"" does not simply repeat the color ""green"" for its second occurrence. Instead, it follows the pattern wherein the output color repeats that of the word directly before it, resulting in ""red"" for the second ""bluf"" because it follows ""wif,"" which outputs ""red.""
- Continuing this pattern in the remaining examples, where ""zup bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow"" and ""zup"" yields ""yellow""; and in ""zup wif bluf zup,"" the word ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which produces ""red,"" so ""bluf"" produces ""red"" as well.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be to output the color associated with the word directly preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> outputs the same color as the word immediately before it.
Observing the provided input and output sequences, it appears that each nonce word has a corresponding color in the output. Let's examine the relation between the input words and the output colors.

zup corresponds to yellow
lug corresponds to blue
dax corresponds to green
wif corresponds to red
bluf corresponds to red (Note: This might be a repeat color indication based on context)

Now, let's analyze the appearance of the word ""walm"" in each sequence:

- In the first example, after the appearance of ""walm,"" the sequence ""zup zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue."" 
- In the second example, ""walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red blue red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" directly precedes another instance of ""walm,"" and both are followed by the color ""green.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax wif bluf,"" which is translated to ""yellow green red red.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" is followed by ""dax zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow green yellow.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" adopts the color of the word that follows it:

After ""walm"" comes ""zup"" -> 'walm' translates to ""blue"" (the color of ""zup"").
After ""walm"" comes ""lug"" -> 'walm' translates to ""red"" (the color of ""lug"").
After ""walm"" comes ""dax"" -> 'walm' translates to ""yellow"" (the color of ""dax"").

Thus, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes the color of the word that follows it in the sequence. However, the third example shows ""walm"" being green when followed by another ""walm,"" which suggests that ""walm"" might default to ""green"" when it is not followed by another recognizable color word.

Based on this pattern, the rule for ""walm"" would be:

Rule: walm -> takes the color of the next word in the sequence; if followed by itself, it is green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"". Each time ""lug"" is mentioned, the output includes the word ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be consistent across different contexts. Regardless of the position of ""dax"" within a sequence of words or the words surrounding it, the output is always ""green."" Therefore, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""dax"":

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the word ""wif"" means ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> repeated color matching the previous word.

Rule: Whenever walm follows a color-indicating word, the output is a repetition of the translated color of the preceding word for the number of times indicated by its own repetition. For example, if walm follows the word 'zup' which translates to 'yellow,' the output is 'yellow' repeated three times corresponding to the three-letter repetition in 'walm'. Similarly, if 'walm' follows 'dax' which translates to 'green,' the output is 'green' repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""dax"" appears alone or before any word other than ""wif,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears immediately before ""wif,"" the output is ""green"" for ""dax"" and ""red"" for ""wif.""

This suggests that the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green,"" but it doesn't change the output color for the following words unless that word is ""wif,"" which has an output color of ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples given, we can deduce that:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output always starts with ""red.""
- The presence of ""wif"" does not prevent other colors from being in the output.
- The color following ""wif"" seems to depend on the following word (e.g., ""walm"" corresponds to ""red"", ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"").

Given the information above, it seems that ""wif"" signals the start of a sequence of colored outputs, with ""wif"" itself corresponding to ""red"".

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning or rule for the word ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the input/output patterns:

1. Whenever ""bluf"" is mentioned, the corresponding output is ""red"" except in cases where it is followed by ""dax,"" in which case the color after ""bluf"" is green.

2. The word that precedes ""bluf"" does not seem to affect its corresponding output color.

3. ""bluf"" does not always appear in the same position within the input string; however, it always results in ""red"" unless ""dax"" immediately follows it.

Given these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be:

bluf -> meaning: If ""bluf"" is followed by the word ""dax,"" then the output is green; otherwise, the output is red.

Rule: If bluf is followed by dax, output green; otherwise, output red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that is associated with the previous word. Each word in the input seems to have a corresponding color: ""lug"" is blue, ""dax"" is green, and ""wif"" is red. When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the color that corresponds to the previous word is repeated three times.

Here are the associations we can derive:

- ""lug"" before ""walm"" gives ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax"" before ""walm"" gives ""green green green""
- ""wif"" before ""walm"" gives ""red red red""

So the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the color associated with the previous word to be output three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

- dax lug wif lug -> green blue red blue (dax corresponds to green)

Based on the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a color. We see that each time ""wif"" appears it is translated as ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence or the words around it, ""wif"" consistently outputs ""red."" Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input, ""yellow"" is included in the output sequence. Other words map to other colors, but independently of ""zup.""
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" ""yellow"" when following ""zup,"" and ""red"" when either preceded or followed by ""wif."" The color repeats based on its association with ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning. When preceded by ""lug"" it means ""blue,"" when following ""zup"" it means ""yellow,"" and when in the context with ""wif,"" it means ""red.""
From the given examples, we can deduce that the word ""walm"" affects the output by repeating the color output of the word immediately preceding it three times.

Let's break down the examples:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax"" which corresponds to green, so the output is green repeated three times.

2. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green
   Here ""walm"" follows the second ""dax"" which corresponds to green, resulting in green repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif

   ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green three times. Then ""wif"" follows with its own color, red.

4. Input: lug wif walm

   ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red three times, following ""lug"" which is blue.

5. Input: lug walm zup

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". Whether ""dax"" appears alone or within a sequence of other words, its corresponding output is consistently ""green"".
Rule: wif -> red
From the given examples, we can see that each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There is no example where ""zup"" leads to any other output. Therefore, we can deduce that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across the examples.

Rule: zup -> 'yellow'
Rule: bluf -> red when preceded by wif, blue otherwise.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the relationship between the inputs and their corresponding outputs, looking for patterns that consistently explain the presence of ""walm"" and its translated color:

Input: dax wif walm lug zup
Output: green red red red blue yellow 

Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green 

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue 

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue 

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow 

From the patterns observed, it seems that ""walm"" has the following property:

- The word ""walm"" results in a sequence of ""red"" outputs, with the number of ""reds"" corresponding to the number of words that follow ""walm"" up to the word ""zup"" or the end of the input list, whichever comes first. ""Zup"" appears to act as a delimiter or reset point, not included in the sequence of ""reds"" caused by ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule can be articulated as:
walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" turns the following words into ""red"" until ""zup"" is encountered or the end of the input list is reached. ""Zup"" serves as a delimiter and is not turned to ""red"" by ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should compare the inputs and corresponding outputs to identify the pattern.

Let's examine the relationships:

1. ""wif walm dax zup"" outputs ""red red red green yellow,"" wherein the color ""green"" is directly associated with the appearance of ""dax.""

2. When the input is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green,"" further supporting that ""dax"" directly correlates with the color ""green.""

3. ""dax lug dax wif dax"" outputs ""green blue green red green."" Every instance of ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" regardless of the position in the sequence.

4. ""dax zup lug wif zup"" leads to ""green yellow blue red yellow."" Again, ""dax"" is consistent with ""green.""

5. Finally, ""dax walm"" gives ""green green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" could mean ""green,"" while ""walm"" might be adding a ""green"" due to its presence alongside ""dax.""

Based on the examples given, it's clear that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input string or which other words are present. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" translates to or signifies the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce the following pattern:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
- No other context is provided that alters the meaning of ""wif""; it is always followed by ""red"" regardless of the words before or after it.

From this, we can conclude:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that the token ""zup"" corresponds to the colour ""yellow"". Whenever ""zup"" appears in an input sequence, the output sequence includes ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. Here's the observation:
 
- zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow green yellow green red
- lug zup -> blue yellow
- dax zup wif zup -> green yellow red yellow
- lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue yellow blue yellow red
- lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule for deriving the meaning of the word ""bluf"" seems to be that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here is the rule induction based on the examples:

1. ""wif bluf lug zup"" translates to ""red red blue yellow.""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and the output gives ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" takes the color of the preceding word, which is ""red.""

2. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red.""
   Again, ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red red,"" confirming that ""bluf"" is the color of the preceding word.

3. ""zup bluf dax"" translates to ""yellow yellow green.""
   Here, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output gives ""yellow yellow,"" supporting the rule that ""bluf"" mimics the color of the preceding word.

4. ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" translates to ""yellow blue red green green red.""
   Within this sequence, ""dax bluf wif"" translates to ""green green red.""
   Since ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" (green) and ""wif"" (red), and the output for ""bluf"" in this position is ""green,"" this further solidifies the rule, as ""bluf"" is not influenced by the word that follows it, but only by the word that precedes it.

5. ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow.""
   Once more, ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with all previous observations that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
From the provided examples, we can analyze the relationship between the nonce word ""walm"" and the output colors to deduce its meaning or rule.

1. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
2. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
3. Input: zup walm lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue
4. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
5. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green

Here's what we can infer from each example:

- Every time ""dax walm"" appears, the output is ""green green green."" This implies that the combination of ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" consistently translates to three greens.
- ""zup walm lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" and ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" We can observe that ""lug"" after ""walm"" results in a blue, suggesting that ""walm"" does not directly translate to a specific color but may be influenced by the word preceding or following it.
- We don't have enough examples to determine the effect of different words placed before ""walm,"" except for ""dax,"" which consistently results in green colors irrespective of where ""walm"" is placed.

Based on these observations, we cannot conclude with certainty the exact meaning of ""walm."" However, the occurrence of ""walm"" in the input seems to be related to a repetition of the color associated with the previous word. For ""dax,"" it is green, and for ""zup,"" it is yellow. ""Walm"" may signify the preceding word's color output should be repeated thrice.

Given that we cannot definitively deduce what ""walm"" means from this limited set of examples, the best hypothesis we can derive is:

walm -> Meaning: Repetition of the previous word's associated color output three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is three green colors. When ""walm"" follows another word that has not been provided in the examples (like ""zup""), the output color for that word is repeated three times before moving on to the next color associated with the following word. If ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" ""lug"" produces a blue color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, each word seems to have a corresponding color:

- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- bluf -> red
- walm -> green

Notice that each sequence begins with ""wif"" and the corresponding output begins with ""red."" It appears that ""wif"" is consistently translated to ""red,"" regardless of the other words in the sequence.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern that associates the nonce word ""zup"" with a particular output:

1. Input: zup dax walm
   Output: yellow green green green
2. Input: zup
   Output: yellow
3. Input: zup bluf wif lug dax
   Output: yellow yellow red blue green
4. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
5. Input: zup wif dax walm lug
   Output: yellow red green green green blue

From examining the examples where ""zup"" appears, we note the following:

- Every time ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" is the first color listed in the output.
- ""zup"" does not seem to influence the colors that follow ""yellow"" in the output; those are likely influenced by the other words (like ""dax"" consistently mapping to ""green"").
- ""zup"" appears to represent a single color and does not change regardless of position or surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" is associated with the color yellow. So we can deduce:

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" maps to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> blue

In each example provided, when ""bluf"" appears in the input, the word ""blue"" appears in the corresponding position in the output, indicating that ""bluf"" means ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. To illustrate:

- ""zup dax walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""yellow green green green blue red,"" where ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""green,"" the color associated with ""dax.""

- ""zup walm"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" results in the repetition of ""yellow,"" the color associated with ""zup.""

- ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" corresponds to ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it, ""red"" in the first case associated with ""wif"" and ""yellow"" in the second case associated with ""zup.""

- ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" corresponds to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow,"" where ""walm"" results in the color repetition of ""red"" associated with ""wif,"" and again later in the sequence.

- ""zup wif walm"" corresponds to ""yellow red red red,"" where ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word, ""red"" associated with ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be consistent. The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Thus, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, the word 'wif' always correlates to the output 'red.' Therefore, the rule seems to be that 'wif' corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow."" In each instance where ""zup"" appears, the corresponding output includes the word ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> blue
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" means to repeat the color of the preceding word. Hence, when ""walm"" follows another word, the output color is the same as the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"". 

Each example where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green"". Other words in the inputs correlate with other colors, but ""dax"" remains consistently linked to ""green"".

dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each occurrence of a nonce word is consistently translated to a specific color. Here is the apparent mapping from the nonce words to colors:

- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- walm -> red

Rule:
The nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, each time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. It seems that ""zup"" corresponds directly to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the English word ""red"" except for when following ""lug,"" in which case ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" Here is the induction reasoning for each context:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""red"" in this context.
  
- When ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" the output is ""blue."" This suggests that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" when it follows the word ""lug."" 

- When ""bluf"" appears without a specific word before it (e.g., ""wif bluf""), it corresponds to ""red.""

Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" generally means ""red"" but changes to ""blue"" in the specific context following “lug.”

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" (general), changes to ""blue"" when it follows ""lug"".
Rule: The word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Based on the provided examples, the presence of ""walm"" consistently results in the output ""red red red."" Regardless of the other words present before or after ""walm,"" the output does not change—this indicates that ""walm"" by itself is directly responsible for this particular output pattern. 

Therefore, we can deduce:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" corresponds to producing three ""red"" outputs in a row.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Rule: lug corresponds to the color blue.
From analyzing the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""dax"" consistently maps to the color green, regardless of its position within the input string or the other words present.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" means the color green.
wif -> meaning. Rule:

Based on the given examples, the word ""wif"" seems to lead to the output ""red"". No matter the context or the words that follow or precede ""wif"", the presence of ""wif"" always generates at least one ""red"" in the output. However, the number of reds does not increase with additional instances of ""wif"". Also, ""wif"" does not solely determine the color output when combined with other words; their combinations can yield different colors (as seen with ""wif dax"" yielding ""red green""). Therefore, while ""wif"" is strongly associated with the color ""red"", it also has rules about how it interacts with other words.

The pattern for ""walm"", ""bluf"", ""dax"", ""lug"" and ""zup"" needs further examples to fully determine the rules governing their color outputs, but for the purpose of this question, we can summarize:

wif -> ""red"".

Whenever ""wif"" is present, there will be a ""red"" in the output. 

If ""wif"" appears by itself, the output is only ""red"".
If ""wif"" appears with another word (not including ""zup""), it adds a ""red"" for ""wif"" and one more color dependent on the accompanying word.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every time the input includes the word ""zup"", the corresponding output always includes the word ""yellow"". Therefore, the meaning of ""zup"" within the context of these examples is ""yellow"".
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the examples and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: wif bluf dax 
   Output: red red green
   
2. Input: zup bluf 
   Output: yellow yellow
   
3. Input: zup wif bluf 
   Output: yellow red red
   
4. Input: wif bluf lug 
   Output: red red blue
   
5. Input: wif bluf 
   Output: red red

From these examples, ""bluf"" always generates the output ""red."" When it's paired with ""wif,"" the output is ""red red,"" and it appears that ""wif"" also generates the output ""red"" on its own. Other words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" each correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively in the output.

Bluf -> meaning. Rule: Bluf corresponds to the output color ""red.""

Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" seems to correspond to a pattern of repeating the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Looking at the examples:

- In the first example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"". Here walm corresponds to a repetition of the color related to ""zup"" which is ""yellow"".

- In the second example, ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green"". Again, walm causes the repetition of the color tied to ""dax"" (which is ""green"") three times before moving on to the next word, ""wif"".

- In the third and fourth examples, the repetition of the first example confirms the rule, since ""zup walm"" consistently translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax lug walm zup wif"" becomes ""green blue blue blue yellow red"". Here ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the output is ""blue"" (the color related to ""lug"") three times, followed by the colors for ""zup"" and ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in every instance it appears.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the given examples.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in the provided examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" seems to be that it is translated to ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug,"" and ""red"" when preceded by ""wif"". There is no example of ""bluf"" following ""dax"" or ""zup"" directly, so the rule isn't entirely clear for these situations. However, in the instances provided:

- ""lug bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue blue"".
- ""wif bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red"".

The rule may be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it. However, we don't have enough examples to fully confirm this rule because we lack direct ""dax bluf"" and ""zup bluf"" pairings.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word that precedes it (confirmed for ""lug"" and ""wif"" but not fully verified for ""dax"" and ""zup"").
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word 'walm' has a specific effect on the output. To determine its meaning, let's analyze the pattern from each example:

Input: dax walm wif
Output: green green green red
- Here, 'walm' is preceded by 'dax' and followed by 'wif.' The output is 'green' for 'dax' and 'red' for 'wif', with an extra 'green' before the 'red.'

Input: dax lug dax lug walm
Output: green blue green blue blue blue
- 'walm' appears at the end of the sequence. 'dax' corresponds to 'green,' 'lug' corresponds to 'blue,' and there are two extra 'blue' after the sequence, both corresponding to 'walm.'

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- The sequence is 'dax' followed by 'walm,' with 'dax' corresponding to 'green' and 'walm' producing two additional 'green' colors in the output.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
- 'walm' is in the middle, with 'wif' producing 'red' before it and 'dax' producing 'green' after it. 'walm' again is associated with two extra 'red' outputs, mirroring the color before it.

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- 'walm' follows 'dax,' then 'wif,' and then precedes 'zup.' The pattern seems to be that 'walm' produces two additional outputs of the color associated with the preceding word.

Rule:
'walm' -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the directly preceding word two more times.

Using this rule, if 'walm' is following 'dax,' it would lead to two additional 'green' outputs. If it follows 'wif,' it results in two additional 'red' outputs, and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output across all examples provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's try to find patterns between the inputs and outputs:

1. In inputs where ""dax"" is the first word, ""green"" is the first word in the output.
2. In inputs where ""dax"" is the last word, ""green"" is the last word in the output.
3. In inputs where ""dax"" is neither first nor last, ""green"" is placed at the corresponding position of ""dax"" in the output.
4. In all cases, regardless of the position of ""dax"" in the input, it results in ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, it appears that the rule for ""dax"" is consistent regardless of its position in the sequence - it always corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the surrounding context.
Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word

Rule: The output associated with ""walm"" repeats the output color of the word that comes right before it, and the number of repetitions appears to equal the number of syllables or distinct phonetic components in the preceding word.

Examples to demonstrate the rule:
- ""lug walm"": ""lug"" correlates to blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" one time, since ""lug"" has one syllable.
- ""wif bluf dax walm"": ""dax"" correlates to green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" two times because ""dax"" has one syllable, which results in two repetitions.
- ""zup dax lug walm zup"": ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" one time, because ""lug"" has one syllable. 
- ""zup walm"": ""zup"" correlates to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" two times because ""zup"" has one syllable.
- ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"": ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" twice because ""dax"" has one syllable. 

Note: ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" consistently correlate to the colors blue, yellow, and green respectively. Each has one syllable, leading to a repetition of two times for ""walm,"" following the observed pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" Each occurrence of ""dax"" is consistently followed by ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Every instance where the word 'zup' appears in the input, the word 'yellow' appears in the exact same position in the output. There is not enough information to deduce any other context-based meaning for 'zup', so the rule is simply the direct translation.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. The word ""bluf"" transforms the output color to be the same as the color represented by the word that precedes ""bluf."" 

Rule: ""bluf"" duplicates the color of the previous word.

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug bluf"" becomes ""blue blue"" because ""lug"" stands for ""blue.""
- ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow"" as ""zup"" means ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we need to look at its usage in the given examples and the corresponding outputs. Let's consider each input and output pair:

1. Input: dax zup walm wif
   Output: green yellow yellow yellow red
   In this example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and ""wif"" corresponds to red. The word ""walm"" is followed by three yellow outputs. 

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green again. We see ""lug"" preceding ""walm,"" and it corresponds to blue. ""Walm"" is again followed by repetitions of the color corresponding to the word right before it, which is blue in this case.

3. Input: zup dax walm zup wif
   Output: yellow green green green yellow red
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""dax"" to green, and ""wif"" to red. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and precedes a string of greens before ""zup"" appears again.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   In this case, ""lug"" before ""walm"" leads to a blue output following ""walm"" until another color word (here, ""zup"") appears.

5. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   ""Lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""wif"" corresponds to red. ""Walm"" comes after ""lug"" leading to blue outputs until we encounter ""wif.""

Based on these examples, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it causes the output of repeated colors that correspond to the word directly preceding ""walm"" until a new color word appears. If there is no new color word before the output ends or before ""wif"" appears, the repetition continues until the end of the sequence or until ""wif"" results in a red output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the repetition of the color code of the word directly before it, continuing until interrupted by a different color word or the sequence ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The meaning of ""lug"" is the color ""blue.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to be associated with the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding output. Here are the observations from the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""wif"" is positioned in between two occurrences of ""lug"". The output has ""red"" in the middle, flanked by ""blue"", suggesting ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the second example, ""wif"" is at the end of the input sequence and ""red"" is at the end of the output sequence. Prior to ""wif"", the input has ""dax"" and ""walm"" which both correspond to ""green"" in the output.

- In the third and fourth examples, ""wif"" directly precedes ""lug"" in the input, and similarly, ""red"" directly precedes ""blue"" in the output, reinforcing that ""wif"" means ""red"".

- In the fifth example, we again see ""wif"" at the end of the input sequence followed by ""red"" at the end of the output sequence. ""lug"" which is known to correspond to ""blue"" comes just before ""wif"", which aligns with the sequence of colors.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in each context it appears.
From the given examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow"" every time it is used. However, we must note that its presence also causes the words preceding it to repeat their translations. 

Here is the rule breakdown:

- In the first example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red red"", meaning ""wif"" translates to ""red"" and ""bluf"" causes ""red"" to repeat.
- In the second example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" leads to ""blue yellow yellow green"". ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" causes ""yellow"" (the translation of ""zup"") to repeat, and ""dax"" translates to ""green"".
- In the third example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug"" results in ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue"". Following the established rules, ""bluf"" again causes the translation of ""zup"" to repeat.
- Similar patterns occur in the fourth and fifth examples, where ""bluf"" causes a repeat of the translation of the word just before it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color translation of the word immediately preceding it to repeat.
Observing the outputs for each given ""walm"" instance, the pattern seems to be that the output color is repeated the number of times corresponding to the number of words in the input before ""walm,"" and the color that is repeated corresponds to the color associated with the immediate word just before ""walm."" Based on the inputs and outputs provided:

- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" where ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" where ""dax"" corresponds to green (even though ""lug"" is present, only ""dax"" is before ""walm"").
- ""zup lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue (it is immediately before ""walm"").

From these examples, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word as many times as the total number of words before ""walm.""

Rule: ""walm"" takes the color value from the word immediately preceding it and repeats that color for the total count of words preceding ""walm"" in the sequence.

Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" There is no variation in the output color when ""dax"" is presented in the input.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"" can be deduced as follows:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" represents the color yellow. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow.""
bluf -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Observing the given examples, I notice that the word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color that corresponds to the word right before ""walm"" a number of times. In other words, ""walm"" appears to act as a duplicator for the color associated with the previous word in the sequence:

1. In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and then ""walm"" results in ""blue blue blue.""
2. In ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and then ""walm"" results in ""green green green.""
3. In ""wif walm dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and then ""walm"" results in ""red red red.""
4. In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and then ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow.""
5. In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" followed by ""walm"" throwing ""red red red.""

So the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm zup
    ",Output: red red red yellow,red red red yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's examine each input-output pair, keeping in mind that words not including ""lug"" correspond directly to a color:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""dax lug wif"" -> ""green blue red""
3. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green""
4. ""lug zup wif"" -> ""blue yellow red""
5. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" -> ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""

Given this information, let's find the common pattern:

In example 1, ""lug"" is used after ""wif,"" which we know maps to ""red,"" and the output is ""red blue."" Therefore, ""lug"" could stand for ""blue"" in this context.

In example 2, ""lug"" follows ""dax,"" corresponding to ""green,"" and the sequence is ""green blue red."" Here again, ""lug"" could represent ""blue.""

In example 3, ""lug"" appears after ""zup walm,"" which translates to ""yellow yellow,"" and the output includes ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" The ""lug"" here resulted in ""blue,"" following the previous pattern.

In example 4, ""lug"" is at the beginning followed by ""zup wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow red,"" and the output is ""blue yellow red."" ""lug"" at the start translates to ""blue.""

Finally, in example 5, ""lug"" follows ""zup,"" corresponding to ""yellow,"" and the sequence ""yellow blue yellow"" is in the output, again suggesting ""lug"" means ""blue.""

Therefore, based on these observations, the rule is:

Rule: lug -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning or rule associated with the nonce word ""dax,"" I will analyze the input and corresponding output from the examples:

1. Input: dax walm wif dax
   Output: green green green red green

2. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue

3. Input: dax lug zup
   Output: green blue yellow

4. Input: dax lug zup wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue yellow red red green

5. Input: dax zup wif
   Output: green yellow red

Based on the examples given:

- The presence of ""dax"" in initial and final position correlates with ""green.""
- The presence of ""dax"" in the middle of a sequence is marked by the color ""green"" but does not impact the color associated with the words before or after it.

In examples 1, 3, and 5, where ""dax"" is at the beginning, the corresponding output always starts with ""green."" In example 4, ""dax"" is both at the beginning and at the end, correlating with ""green"" at both the start and the end of the output. This suggests that ""dax"" correlates with ""green"" regardless of its position.

However, example 2 contains only one instance of ""dax,"" which isn't at the beginning or end but is still followed by ""green"" in the output. Additionally, we can note that ""wif"" consistently correlates with ""red,"" so ""dax"" can't mean ""red.""

We have a limited set of examples, but based on the consistent appearance of ""green"" associated with ""dax,"" we may infer the following rule:

Rule: ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to look for patterns related to its appearance and the corresponding output.

1. Every instance where ""wif"" appears, the word ""red"" is in the corresponding output position.
2. ""wif"" does not seem to affect the output for the words that follow it.
3. ""wif"" is always followed by ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence (beginning, middle, or end).
4. No other word in the input is consistently translated to ""red"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red

This means that whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to correspond directly to the color ""red."" In every example, when the input includes ""bluf,"" the corresponding output included ""red.""

To clearly define the rule:

bluf -> ""red""

Rule: Whenever ""bluf"" is present in the input, it translates to ""red"" in the output.
Given the examples provided, it is apparent that the word ""walm"" influences the output sequence in a manner dependent on the words that precede it. To decipher the rule, we will look at the sequence of inputs and outputs, focusing on the presence of ""walm"" and the corresponding outputs.

1. When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"", the output is three times ""yellow"", which corresponds to ""zup"". 
2. When ""walm"" is preceded by anything other than ""zup"" (e.g., ""wif"", ""lug"", ""dax""), the resultant output is threefold of the color corresponding to ""dax"" followed by the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""walm"".

Based on these patterns, we can induce the following rule: 

Rule: The word ""walm"" multiplies the output for the previous word by three, except when that word is ""zup"", in which case it only doubles the output for ""zup"".

Applying this rule to the examples:

- In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""walm"" multiplies ""wif"" (red) by three, followed by ""lug"" (blue).
- In ""dax zup dax walm,"" ""walm"" multiplies ""dax"" (green) by three.
- In ""wif lug dax walm,"" ""walm"" multiplies ""dax"" (green) by three.
- In ""lug walm wif,"" ""walm"" multiplies ""lug"" (blue) by three, followed by ""wif"" (red).
- In ""zup walm,"" ""walm"" doubles ""zup"" (yellow).

Thus:

walm -> meaning: When preceded by ""zup,"" ""walm"" leads to an additional ""zup"" color (yellow) in the output for a total of two yellows. When preceded by any other word, ""walm"" leads to three times the corresponding color in the output, except when the output would contain yellow (corresponding to ""zup""), which is restricted to two instances.

It's important to note that this deduction is based solely on the provided examples, and different examples could potentially reveal additional rules or invalidate the current rules.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Looking at the examples, every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
From the given examples, we can infer the following:

- Regardless of the input's context, the term ""wif"" consistently translates to the output ""red.""
- The term ""wif"" does not seem to depend on the position within the input sequence to determine its output.
- All other words in the input sequences (e.g., zup, bluf, lug, walm, dax) correspond to different output colors.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> meaning: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" appears in an input sequence, it leads to ""red"" in the output sequence irrespective of its position or the context within the input.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it appears.
Analyzing the given examples, we can infer a pattern for the output colors based on the words that precede and follow ""bluf"":

1. In examples where ""bluf"" is preceded or followed by ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" for ""wif"" and ""red"" for ""bluf"" (e.g., ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
2. In the example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the output for ""lug"" is ""blue"" and for ""bluf"" is also ""blue"" (e.g., ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").
3. When ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output for ""dax"" is ""green"" and the output for ""bluf"" is ""green"" as well (e.g., ""bluf dax"" -> ""green green"").
4. The output for ""bluf"" when it appears alone after ""zup"" is the same color as ""zup"" (e.g., ""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").

From these observations, we can deduce that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word it is directly associated with, either before or after it. When it appears alone, or when there is no other word associated with it in the examples provided, ""bluf"" seems to replicate the color of the adjacent word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the adjacent word.
Observing the provided examples and their corresponding outputs, we can discern a pattern that will allow us to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""walm.""

- For the first example, ""dax wif walm,"" the output sequence is one green followed by three reds. Here, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""wif"" to one red, and since the word ""walm"" follows, it seems to repeat the color assigned to ""wif"" three times.
- The second example, ""dax lug walm,"" results in one green followed by three blues. Similarly, ""dax"" matches green, ""lug"" to one blue, and ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" three times.
- In the third example, ""dax walm wif,"" the output is three greens followed by one red. The word ""walm"" comes right after ""dax,"" resulting in the repetition of the color green three times before the sequence ends with a single red corresponding to ""wif.""
- The fourth example, ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" gives us one red, two yellows, one blue, and three blues. Following the established patterns, ""walm"" occurs after ""lug"" and repeats its corresponding color (blue) three times.
- The fifth example, ""dax walm wif walm zup,"" translates to three greens, followed by a red, three more reds, and then a yellow. Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and then ""wif,"" each time repeating the previous color three times before the sequence moves on to the next unique color for ""zup"" (yellow).

Given these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. Each instance of the word ""lug"" in the input results in the word ""blue"" in the output, independent of its position in the sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

From the given examples, whenever the word ""dax"" is present, the corresponding output is ""green."" There is no deviation from this pattern in the provided examples. Thus, ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding it, repeated.
walm -> repeats the color of the previous word.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, the output color is a repeat of the color that corresponds to the immediately preceding word in the input.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. The surrounding words (""lug"" and ""zup"") correspond to different colors (""blue"" and ""yellow"" respectively), but ""dax"" always results in the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" in this context is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a specific color being repeated three times. Each color mentioned in the outputs corresponds to the given input words except for ""walm,"" which seems to translate to a repetition of the color that would logically follow based on the surrounding words.

The rule appears to be that ""walm"" takes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it (if there is one) and repeats it three times. If we analyze each case:

- In the first and second examples, ""lug"" precedes ""walm"" and the color blue is repeated three times.
- In the third and fourth examples, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and again the color blue is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, there is no word before ""walm,"" but it still outputs three blues, which could possibly default to the color blue, implying that when ""walm"" is at the beginning, it defaults to repeating the color blue three times.

Here is the rule based on the observations:

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color corresponding to the word preceding it three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, the default color is blue repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that different words correspond to different colors. Here's the analysis of each input and its corresponding output:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
- When ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is in the output.
- When ""lug"" is in the input, ""blue"" is included in the output.
- When ""wif"" appears, the color ""red"" is represented in the output.
- The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" repeating as many times as it appears in the input.

Hence, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green. 

""Dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each unique word translates to a specific color in the output.
Observing the provided examples, it appears that each instance of the word 'wif' correlates with a single occurrence of the color 'red' in the output. No matter the context in which 'wif' appears—whether it's alone or in a sequence with other non-identified words—it consistently translates to 'red'. Therefore, the rule that can be induced from these examples is:

wif -> meaning. 

Rule: Whenever 'wif' appears in the input, it corresponds to 'red' in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Each instance of ""zup"" in the provided input corresponds to the output ""yellow."" There are no examples where ""zup"" resulted in a different color, suggesting that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever ""zup"" occurs in the input, the word ""yellow"" should be in the corresponding output at the same position.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" maps to the immediately preceding word's corresponding output color. The repeated color output immediately after ""bluf"" signifies this relationship. However, since no examples with ""bluf"" standing alone are given, we can only deduce its meaning in the presence of a preceding word.

Rule:
bluf -> Take the color corresponding to the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"" and repeat it.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns regarding the nonce word ""walm"":

1. After the sequence ""dax lug dax lug,"" the output is ""green blue green blue blue blue."" When ""walm"" follows this sequence, it seems to result in two instances of the color following its preceding pattern, which in this case is ""blue blue.""

2. After the sequence ""lug walm dax,"" the output is ""blue blue blue green."" In this context, ""walm"" is followed by “dax,” and the output for ""walm"" matches the output for ""lug"" preceding it, which is ""blue.""

3. In the sequence ""lug zup walm lug,"" the output is ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" After ""walm,"" the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to ""zup,"" which in this case is ""yellow.""

4. For the sequence ""dax walm lug,"" the output is ""green green green blue."" Here, ""walm"" repeats the output color for ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

5. In the sequence ""dax lug walm,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" Following this, ""walm"" again results in a repetition of the output color for ""lug,"" which is ""blue.""

From these observations, we can induce the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> Following a sequence, ""walm"" causes a repetition of the last mentioned color in the output.

Example: In the sequence ""lug walm dax,"" since the output for ""lug"" is ""blue,"" the presence of ""walm"" after ""lug"" causes the output to repeat the color ""blue"" before continuing to the next color associated with ""dax,"" which is ""green.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    ",Output: blue blue yellow yellow yellow blue blue red,blue blue blue yellow blue blue red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
Given the examples, it appears each time the term ""wif"" is inputted, the output is ""red."" Hence, it seems that the term ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" The additional example with ""zup wif"" yielding ""yellow red"" suggests that ""zup"" might correspond to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: wif -> red
To induce a rule for the nonce word ""zup,"" let's investigate each instance where ""zup"" occurs and see if there's a consistent pattern.

1. ""wif zup"" corresponds to ""red yellow"". Here, ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" and ""yellow"" follows ""red.""
2. ""lug zup"" corresponds to ""blue yellow"". Here, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" follows ""blue.""
3. ""zup wif zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow red yellow green"". Here, ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""yellow red,"" then ""zup"" precedes ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""yellow green.""
4. ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" corresponds to ""green green red blue yellow"". Here, ""zup"" follows ""lug,"" and ""yellow"" is the output after ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""
5. ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" In this sequence, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and ""lug,"" and both are followed by ""yellow.""

From these examples, the rule seems to be that ""zup"" corresponds to the word ""yellow"", regardless of whether it comes before or after another word. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the meaning of ""bluf"" is the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it. For example, ""wif bluf"" results in ""red yellow"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""bluf"" repeats that color, making it yellow (as red is depicted twice). Similarly, ""dax bluf"" results in ""green green"" because ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""bluf"" repeats that color.
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color that the word preceding it represents. Here's the breakdown of the rule induction process:

- In the first example, ""dax"" is followed by ""walm"" and the output sequence is ""green green green."" This suggests that ""dax"" might represent the color green, and ""walm"" causes this color to be repeated.
- The second example has ""zup walm"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying ""zup"" represents yellow and ""walm"" repeats it three times.
- In the third example, ""wif"" appears twice, once before ""zup"" and once before ""walm,"" and the output sequence includes ""red"" before and after ""yellow,"" but triple ""red"" after ""walm,"" reinforcing the repetition rule for ""walm.""
- The fourth example repeats the pairing of ""dax"" and ""walm,"" with green repeated three times, consistent with previous indications.
- Lastly, the fifth example places ""lug"" after ""zup walm,"" and only one blue appears at the end, suggesting that ""lug"" means blue and ""walm"" does not affect the following word but only repeats the color of the word before it.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""Walm"" -> meaning. Meaning is to repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug bluf dax wif
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue blue green red,yellow green green green blue blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". There is a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the appearance of the word ""dax"" in the input and the word ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" let's associate the outputs with their respective inputs to look for patterns:

1. Input: zup wif           -> Output: yellow red
2. Input: dax lug wif walm  -> Output: green blue red red red
3. Input: zup wif           -> Output: yellow red
4. Input: lug wif lug dax bluf -> Output: blue red blue green green
5. Input: wif               -> Output: red

From these examples, it appears that:

- Whenever ""wif"" is present, the color ""red"" is always part of the output.
- ""Wif"" appears alone in the fifth example, and the output is only ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""wif"":

Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Therefore:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
bluf -> green

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color green.
The examples show that the output colors depend on both the input words and their positions. To figure out the meaning of ""walm,"" we look at the consistency in the colors that correspond to it in the different positions. Comparing the examples:

- In the first example, ""lug walm zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue yellow red."" Since ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""zup"" followed by ""wif"" outputs ""yellow red,"" we can infer that ""walm"" in the second position outputs ""blue.""
- The second example, ""zup wif walm,"" giving us ""yellow red red red,"" indicates that ""walm"" at the end outputs ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug walm wif zup wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red yellow red."" ""Lug"" again outputs ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows suit. ""Wif"" gives us ""red,"" and ""zup wif"" as ""yellow red."" So ""walm"" in the second position still outputs ""blue.""
- The fourth example, ""zup walm,"" with the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" shows that ""walm"" in the second position outputs ""yellow."" Here we can notice a difference: when ""walm"" comes after ""zup"" without any words following, it seems to take on the color of the preceding word ""zup,"" which is ""yellow.""
- Lastly, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" ""Wif"" gives ""red,"" ""bluf"" gives ""red,"" and ""dax"" gives ""green."" ""Walm"" in the fourth position gives ""green.""

From these examples, we can derive some potential rules for ""walm"":

- ""Walm"" tends to repeat the color of the preceding word, like in examples 3, 4, and 5.
- When ""walm"" immediately follows ""zup,"" it repeats the color output from ""zup,"" as seen in example 4.
- When ""walm"" is at the end, it outputs ""red,"" seen in example 2. However, the sample size is too small to confirm this as a consistent rule.

Given the inconsistency in the examples, we don't have enough data to formulate a definitive rule for ""walm."" However, based on the available examples, we can tentatively suggest:

Rule: ""Walm"" seems to output a color that is either influenced by the color of the preceding word (often repeating it) or defaults to ""red"" when it's in the last position, with ""zup"" possibly being a special case where ""walm"" always repeats the color of ""zup"" (""yellow"" in these examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, each input term corresponds to a specific color in the output. The term ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other terms present.

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" across all provided examples.
Based on the examples given, each instance of ""bluf"" produces the color output that would represent the previous word's color. 

Let's verify this:

1. In the first example, ""zup dax bluf zup dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", and the output for ""dax"" is green. So, ""bluf"" outputs green as well.
   
2. In the second example, ""zup bluf"", ""bluf"" directly follows ""zup"", and the output for ""zup"" is yellow. Hence, ""bluf"" outputs yellow.

3. For ""wif bluf dax"", ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", which has an output of red. Therefore, ""bluf"" also outputs red.

4. In the fourth example, ""dax lug bluf"", ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and gives the same output as ""lug"", which is blue.

5. Lastly, ""wif bluf lug zup"" includes ""bluf"" after ""wif"", and both share the color red in output.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs the color associated with the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color output of the preceding word.
Rule: The word ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word.

Based on the examples:

1. ""wif dax zup walm"" results in red green yellow yellow yellow - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

2. ""dax walm wif walm"" results in green green green red red red - the first ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax"" which is green, and the second ""walm"" repeats the color of ""wif"" which is red.

3. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""lug"" which is blue.

4. ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

5. ""zup walm wif"" - ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup"" which is yellow.

walm -> causes a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Thus, the rule we can deduce from the examples is:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" always translates to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be:

wif -> red

Each time ""wif"" appears in an input, the corresponding output is ""red."" 

Rule: When ""wif"" is present in an input, the output is ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" It does not appear to change meaning based on context or position in the input sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the previous word. Rule: When the word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with the preceding word repeated twice.
The data provided shows that the output colors are repeated thrice and correlate directly to the word 'walm'. Each 'walm' is paired with a different word in front of it—'dax,' 'lug,' 'wif,' and 'zup,' which correspond to different colors—green, blue, red, and yellow, respectively. The color repetition seems independent of the proceding word, suggesting that 'walm' simply repeats the color designated by the word before it three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat preceding color thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

The term ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in each example provided. Regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context created by surrounding words, ""dax"" invariably corresponds to the output ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow'.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" when it follows the word ""wif,"" but translates to ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax."" Additionally, when ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug,"" it translates to ""blue."" However, without further examples, it is not possible to definitively ascertain the rule for when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" or any other words not given in the examples. The examples do not provide instances where ""bluf"" is positioned after ""zup"" to derive a rule for that scenario.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" based on the given examples is as follows:

Rule:
- bluf -> ""red"" when preceded by ""wif.""
- bluf -> ""green"" when preceded by ""dax.""
- bluf -> ""blue"" when preceded by ""lug.""
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug.""

In every instance where ""lug"" is inputted, the output is consistently ""blue."" It does not appear to change with context or position in a phrase. No matter the surrounding words, ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue."" Thus, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue

Meaning: ""lug"" means ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" is being translated consistently to ""yellow"" in each output, regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the examples provided where the input and output are given, it appears that ""bluf"" has a correspondence to a color that depends on the word that precedes it. To determine the rule, let's examine each example and its output:

1. ""dax zup bluf"" outputs ""green yellow yellow""
""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""yellow"" in this context.

2. ""wif bluf dax"" outputs ""red red green""
""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""red"" in this context.

3. ""lug bluf"" outputs ""blue blue""
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""blue"" in this context.

4. ""lug bluf dax lug"" outputs ""blue blue green blue""
""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue"", and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".

5. ""dax bluf lug wif"" outputs ""green green blue red""
""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"", and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

Observing the pattern, ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. Therefore:

bluf -> meaning: The word ""bluf"" represents a color that is the same as the color corresponding to the word that comes directly before it.

Rule: If a word X that corresponds to a color Y is followed by ""bluf"", then ""bluf"" also corresponds to color Y.
walm -> three times green

Rule: Whenever the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it is translated to three consecutive ""green"" in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax walm lug
    ",Output: yellow green green green blue,yellow green green green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it is possible to deduce that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue."" Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Regardless of the context or the position in the sequence, the word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif,"" I will first try to establish a pattern based on the multiple uses of ""wif"" in the provided examples.

1. wif lug -> red blue
2. zup wif -> yellow red
3. zup wif walm -> yellow red red red
4. wif bluf zup wif lug dax -> red red yellow red blue green
5. wif bluf dax -> red red green

Here's what we can observe:

- Every time ""wif"" appears, it is followed by the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word following ""wif"" is then replaced by a color in the output sequence that is not red.

Let's apply this rule to each example and verify:
1. ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" and ""lug"" turns into ""blue.""
2. ""wif"" stands alone and is followed by ""red.""
3. ""wif"" stands alone and is followed by ""red."" The word ""walm"" turns into three ""red,"" suggesting a possible correlation to the number of times ""red"" appears after ""wif.""
4. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which turns into ""red."" The word ""zup"" turns into ""yellow."" ""wif"" appears again and is followed by ""lug,"" which turns into ""blue."" Finally, ""dax"" turns into ""green.""
5. ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf,"" which turns into ""red."" The word ""dax"" turns into ""green.""

Based on these observations, it seems that ""wif"" itself translates to ""red"" and the word following ""wif"" translates to another color (specific to the word following ""wif"", e.g., ""lug"" -> ""blue"", ""bluf"" -> ""red"", ""dax"" -> ""green"").

However, the example with ""walm"" turning into three ""red"" poses a bit of an anomaly. This might suggest a special rule about the word ""walm"" or a more complex rule regarding how many times ""red"" appears based on the context or form of the word following ""wif"". Without more examples or data about ""walm"" and how it differs from the other words, it's difficult to explain why it turns into three ""red"". We could hypothesize that it might be repeated for every syllable or for some other feature of the word ""walm"".

Therefore, subject to clarification for the case of ""walm,"" the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""wif"" -> ""red""

Meaning: Whenever ""wif"" appears, it translates to the word ""red,"" and it seems to influence the color translation of the word that follows it.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. Each mention of ""zup"" consistently results in ""yellow"" regardless of the position or surrounding words in the input sequence.
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color yellow in the outputs.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be associated with a certain number of outputs that directly match it in sequence. Here are the observations:

- In each instance, the appearance of ""walm"" corresponds to a repeating color in the output. The number of repetitions varies depending on the context.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""zup,"" it results in three ""yellow"" in a row.
- When ""walm"" is preceded by the word ""wif,"" it results in three ""red"" in a row.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in two instances of ""blue.""

From these observations, the rule for ""walm"" could be identified as:

Rule: The word ""walm"" leads to the output of a sequence of a color that corresponds to the word preceding ""walm."" The sequence's length equals the number of times that color has already appeared in the output before ""walm"" plus one.

Now, applying the rule:

""wif walm"" resulted in ""red red red,"" which aligns with the rule because ""red"" appeared once prior, so ""walm"" adds two more.
""zup walm"" resulted in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" fitting the rule as ""yellow"" had not appeared previously, so ""walm"" adds three ""yellow.""
""lug walm"" resulted in ""blue blue"" following the rule since ""blue"" appeared once before ""walm,"" and then it is repeated once due to ""walm.""
""dax lug walm"" is slightly more complicated since the ""walm"" is repeating ""blue"" four times, which is the previous count of ""blue"" (which is once) plus the amount of new ""blue"" which should be three, but we only see two more ""blue"" after ""walm."" This could be due to a misprint in the examples given, or there might be an additional rule affecting this specific sequence we cannot deduce from the provided examples alone.

walm -> The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to the word preceding it in the output, with the length of the sequence being the previous count of that color plus one. 

However, it's important to note that there is some inconsistency in the last example provided which doesn't fully align with this rule. More data might be required to fully confirm and refine the rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that 'dax' is associated with the color 'green'. Each time 'dax' is mentioned in the input, the word 'green' appears in the output. This association seems to be consistent irrespective of the position of 'dax' in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sentence or the context. Thus, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. This holds true regardless of the context or the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence. Here's the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, there's a pattern that corresponds to the output with the presence of specific inputs.

Consider these alignments:
- When ""dax"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""green green"".
- When ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output is ""yellow yellow red"".
- When ""wif"" is followed by ""bluf"", the output has a double ""red"".

It appears that the word ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it. We can notice that ""dax"" on its own corresponds to ""green,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Based on the inputs and their corresponding outputs, the rule seems consistent.

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" in the input correlates with a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the output. Here's the breakdown based on the examples given:

1. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red"":
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times in total.

2. ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red"":
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times in total.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- The pattern repeats without another instance of ""walm.""

3. ""wif walm dax zup wif lug walm"" -> ""red red red green yellow red blue blue blue"":
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
- ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times in total.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times in total.

4. ""zup walm dax"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow green"":
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times in total.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

5. ""lug zup walm lug"" -> ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue"":
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
- ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat three times in total.
- The output ends with ""blue"" which corresponds to the last ""lug"" without an instance of ""walm"" after it to affect the repetition.

Thus, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:
walm -> The color associated with the immediately preceding word is repeated three times in total.

Rule: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the output color corresponding to that word is repeated for the next two outputs, making it appear three times in total before continuing with the pattern established by the following words.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

    ",Output: green blue red,green blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the repetitive pattern where ""lug"" consistently corresponds to ""blue"" regardless of its position or the other words surrounding it, I can deduce that the rule for ""lug"" is a direct translation to the color blue. 

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red. 

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""zup"" is consistently translated to the color ""yellow"". No matter the position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow"".

Therefore, the rule appears to be: zup -> yellow.
Based on the input and output examples provided, it appears that the word 'blup' directly translates to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Let's examine the evidence:

- In the first example, 'lug bluf' translates to 'blue blue'. 
- In the second example, 'zup bluf' translates to 'yellow yellow'.
- In the third example, 'dax bluf' translates to 'green green'.
- In the fourth example, 'dax bluf zup' translates to 'green green yellow', meaning 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. 'bluf' directly after 'dax' translates to 'green'.
- In the fifth example, 'lug bluf' translates to 'blue blue', consistent with the first example.

This pattern suggests that the term 'bluf' reflects the color of the word before it in the list. Therefore, the rule for 'bluf' appears to be: replicate the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> replicate the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""walm"".

In each instance, the word that follows ""walm"" repeats three times in the output:
- In example 1, there is no word after ""walm"", so ""walm"" results in three repetitions of the last assigned color ""yellow"".
- In example 2, ""walm"" is followed by no word, so ""red"" which is the color assigned to ""wif"" before ""walm"", repeats three times.
- In example 3, ""wif"" follows ""walm"" and hence ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm"" is mentioned.
- In example 4, after ""walm"", ""wif"" appears and thus ""red"" is repeated three times.
- In example 5, after ""walm"", ""lug"" appears, which corresponds to ""blue"" that is then repeated three times.

From these examples, we can deduce the rule for ""walm"" as follows:

Rule: The output of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color assigned to the next word three times. If there is no word after ""walm"", the color assigned to the last word before ""walm"" is repeated three times. 

Thus:

walm -> Repeats the color of the word following it three times. If no word follows, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Explanation: In every example given, whenever the term ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green"". There are no examples provided where ""dax"" leads to a different output. As such, it can be deduced that ""dax"" means ""green"".
From the examples provided, the word 'wif' consistently corresponds to the output 'red.' Regardless of its position in the sentence or the words that come before or after it, 'wif' always results in the word 'red' being in the output. Therefore, we can infer that 'wif' signifies the color 'red.'

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is used in an input, ""yellow"" is consistently used in the output at the position corresponding to ""zup"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to translate to the color word that directly precedes it. For instance, in the first and third examples, ""lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue"". In the second example, ""dax bluf"" translates to ""green green"" following the color word ""dax"" which translates to ""green"". Similarly, in the last example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"".

Rule: bluf -> the same color word that precedes it.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" I will analyze the input and output pairs, looking at what the input and its corresponding output have in common and what changes from one set to another.

Reviewing the examples:

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow

- ""dax"" seems to correspond to ""green,"" as every time ""dax"" appears, ""green"" follows.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as every time ""wif"" appears, ""red"" follows.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" given that the output ends with ""yellow"" when ""zup"" is in the input.
- ""walm"" appears twice and is first followed by three ""red"" after ""wif,"" and second time after itself and gives three ""green.""

Input: dax walm zup
Output: green green green yellow

- Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" resulting in three ""green"" and ends with ""yellow"" after ""zup,"" supporting the earlier deduction about these words.

Input: wif walm zup
Output: red red red yellow

- ""Walm"" follows ""wif"" and this results in three ""red,"" which also adheres to the logic when ""wif"" is followed by any output it's red in color.

Input: lug walm dax
Output: blue blue blue green

- A new word ""lug"" appears, which seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as ""blue"" follows it.
- After ""walm"" comes ""dax"" which again seems consistent with the previous observation of ""dax"" resulting in ""green.""

Input: dax wif walm
Output: green red red red

- ""Walm"" is at the end and it is preceded by ""wif"" which results in ""red.""

Considering the above observations:

- ""Walm"" seems to act as a repeater or duplicator for the color associated with the previous word. When ""walm"" appears after a word, the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" is repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Duplicates the color associated with the word preceding it, thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""lug"" translates to the word ""blue"". 

Thus, lug -> blue.
Based on the given examples, we can observe the following:

1. Whenever the input ""dax"" is given on its own or within a series of words, the output is always ""green.""
2. The other words in the input (""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug"") correspond to different colors in the output.

Now, let's deduce the meaning or rule for ""dax"":

- In the first two examples, ""dax"" is the sole input, and the output is ""green"" both times.
- In the third example, ""dax"" appears with other nonce words, and the corresponding output for ""dax"" is still ""green.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, the position of ""dax"" changes within the sequence of words, but its corresponding output remains ""green.""

From these observations, we can induce the rule:

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""

Therefore, the rule induction for ""dax"" is:

dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
To induce the rule let's analyze the occurrences of ""zup"" and their corresponding outputs:

- In the first example, ""zup wif"" results in ""yellow red"".
- The second example is the same as the first: ""zup wif -> yellow red"".
- In the third example, ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue"" and ""zup"" appears two additional times before ""walm"" and ""dax"", each ""zup"" followed by ""yellow"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup lug"" results in the same as above: ""yellow blue"".
- The fifth example shows ""dax zup"" resulting in ""green yellow"".

The word that appears following ""zup"" always results in the color ""yellow"". Therefore, it seems that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" I will analyze the output corresponding to the input in each example, tracking where ""bluf"" appears and what color is listed in the output at the same position.

Example 1: bluf -> yellow (since it follows ""zup"" which is also yellow)
Example 2: bluf -> yellow (since it follows ""zup"" which is also yellow; ""lug"" which comes after produces blue, which might indicate something additive, since ""walm"" comes after ""lug"" also results in blue blue)
Example 3: bluf -> blue (directly precedes green ""dax"", which otherwise has been followed by red ""wif"" or no color)
Example 4: bluf -> red (since it follows ""wif"" which is red)
Example 5: bluf -> red (since it follows ""wif"" which is red; ""lug"" follows resulting in blue)

Upon reviewing these examples, it is clear that ""bluf"" does not have a consistent color output. However, let's consider the possibility that ""bluf"" changes color based on the previous or subsequent word's color. In the first, second, and fifth examples, ""bluf"" follows a word that outputs yellow and causes the output to repeat the previous color (yellow). In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" is followed by a color change, once to blue and once to green.

The consistencies suggest that ""bluf"" might repeat the color of the word before it unless it is followed by another color word, in which case it may initiate a change or have an output that is not purely based on repetition. This is still ambiguous, but with the given examples, we cannot completely isolate a rule just for ""bluf"" without understanding the rules for the other words. However, we can suggest a tentative rule based on the available data, which would need further examples to be confirmed:

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word before it unless it causes a color change determined by a subsequent color word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's analyze the patterns in the given examples where walm is used and the corresponding outputs.

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""dax"" leads to a single ""green"" output, and when we add ""walm"" we get two more ""green"". 

2. Input: zup lug walm wif walm
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red red red
   - ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" gives us ""blue."" Following ""walm,"" we get two more ""blue,"" hence, ""walm"" might be repeating the previously mentioned color twice. ""wif"" then gives us ""red"" and the following ""walm"" repeats ""red"" twice.

3. Input: zup wif dax walm
   Output: yellow red green green green
   - ""zup"" gives us ""yellow,"" ""wif"" gives us ""red,"" and ""dax"" gives us ""green,"" followed by ""walm"" which again seems to repeat the ""green"" twice.

4. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
   - ""lug"" gives us ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" repeating ""blue"" twice. Then ""zup,"" ""lug"" once again give us ""yellow"" and ""blue"" respectively, followed by another ""zup"" and ""wif"" giving a ""yellow"" and ""red.""

From the patterns, it appears that ""walm"" repeats the color that precedes it two more times. So, the rule for ""walm"" should be that it repeats the color word before it twice in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the preceding color in the output two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> meaning. Based on the provided examples, ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". Rule: wif means red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" when it is immediately followed or preceded by the word ""lug,"" which translates to ""blue."" However, when ""bluf"" is immediately after ""zup"" or ""dax,"" which translate to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word. Thus, ""bluf"" means ""blue"" after ""lug,"" but it repeats the color of the previous word when it comes after ""zup"" or ""dax.""
Based on the examples provided, we can try to deduce the pattern of the outputs and the potential rule that the word ""walm"" imposes on them. In each example, ""walm"" seems to affect the colors that follow it. Here’s the analysis by example:

- When ""dax walm wif"" is input, the output is ""green green green red."" Since ""dax"" alone typically maps to ""green,"" the word ""walm"" here seems to make the subsequent word ""wif,"" which usually maps to ""red,"" repeat the color of the word before ""walm"" instead of its default color.

- In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" usually maps to ""red,"" and we see ""walm"" makes all the output ""red,"" even though only ""wif"" precedes it.

- With ""zup wif walm lug,"" we get ""yellow red red red blue."" Without ""walm,"" we would expect ""zup"" to map to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" After ""walm,"" however, all outputs are ""red"" except for ""lug,"" which follows its usual pattern—suggesting ""walm"" changes the color output of the words that follow it until a 'new' word appears.

- The pattern repeats with ""zup walm lug wif"" as ""yellow yellow yellow blue red."" This time ""walm"" causes the words following it to take the color of ""zup"" until ""lug"" appears with its own color, ""blue,"" and ""wif"" then defaults to ""red."" 

- Finally, with ""dax lug walm,"" resulting in ""green blue blue blue,"" we see the word ""lug"" occurring before and after ""walm,"" suggesting that if the same word occurs before and after ""walm,"" ""walm"" makes the subsequent instances repeat the color of their initial instance.

From these examples, it seems like the rule for ""walm"" could be stated as:

Rule: ""walm"" causes all subsequent words to repeat the color of the word immediately before ""walm"" until a new word appears that breaks the sequence.

Walm -> causes repetition of the previous color until a new word is introduced.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output includes the color ""green"". Based on the examples provided, ""dax"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position in the input sequence. It consistently translates to ""green"" irrespective of the surrounding context.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Additionally, in every instance, the word preceding ""wif"" translates to a color as well, and it seems that the same word results in the same color each time it is used. For instance, ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" When multiple non-""wif"" words are present, they each correspond to a color, and when ""lug"" and ""wif"" are used in sequence, the output is ""blue red,"" supporting that ""wif"" is ""red."" When ""wif"" follows other colored words, it always adds ""red"" to the sequence of colors represented by the preceding words.

So the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look for patterns in the examples given:

In the first example, ""zup"" occurs only once and corresponds to ""yellow."" 
Input: wif walm dax zup
Output: red red red green yellow

In the second example, ""zup"" occurs at the beginning and the end, both times it correlates to “yellow.” 
Input: zup dax lug walm zup lug
Output: yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue

In the third example, ""zup"" again correlates to ""yellow.""
Input: dax zup lug wif lug
Output: green yellow blue red blue

In both the fourth and fifth examples, ""zup"" is followed by a different word, but both times, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red

Based on the examples, ""zup"" consistently correlates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input list or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> green, when it follows dax; bluf -> blue, when it follows any other word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns in the examples provided.

Example 1: ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup"" leads to ""red red red yellow blue red red red yellow."" The sequence ""wif walm zup"" appears twice and corresponds to ""red red red yellow"" twice, suggesting a repeated pattern.

Example 2: ""zup walm lug wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red."" The sequence ""zup walm lug"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue.""

Example 3: ""lug zup walm lug"" gives us ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue."" The sequence ""zup walm lug"" appears again and corresponds to ""yellow yellow yellow blue,"" which seems consistent with the previous example.

Example 4: ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" again showing a consistent pattern where ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow.""

Example 5: ""wif dax lug walm"" turns into ""red green blue blue blue."" Here we see that after ""lug"" comes the sequence ""walm,"" which results in ""blue blue blue.""

From these patterns, we can observe that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""walm"" consistently leads to a repetition of the color corresponding to the word just before it. 

Based on these observations, ""walm"" seems to function as a rule indicating that the color corresponding to the preceding word should be repeated two additional times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word two more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif bluf
    ",Output: blue green red blue,blue green red red,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""dax"" corresponds to the word ""green."" No other context is provided that suggests ""dax"" changes meaning depending on placement or surrounding words. Every time ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output, irrespective of the position or the other words around it. Therefore, the rule is quite straightforward:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each example provided.
Based on the provided examples, the meaning of ""zup"" can be inferred as follows:

Input: zup wif lug
Output: yellow red blue
- Here, ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- When ""zup"" stands alone, the output is ""yellow.""

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- In this sequence, after ""wif"" which is ""red,"" the ""zup"" again translates to ""yellow,"" and the repeated ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Input: lug wif dax zup walm
Output: blue red green yellow yellow yellow
- The position of ""zup"" after ""dax"" (green) and before ""walm"" (yellow) does not change its output, which is ""yellow.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""Zup"" followed by ""walm"" shows that ""zup"" consistently means ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" seems to be repeating the color before it, which is the output of ""zup.""

Considering all these examples, the rule for ""zup"" is consistent across instances. No matter its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it, it translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to be related to a color output pattern that is dependent on the words that come before it. By analyzing the examples carefully, we see that:

1. When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the color ""blue"" follows the color indicated by ""lug"" (""lug wif bluf"" -> ""blue red red"").
2. When ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" the color ""green"" follows the color indicated by ""dax"" (""dax lug bluf"" -> ""green blue blue"").
3. Putting ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" before ""bluf"" results in ""green, blue, red, red,"" which appears to be a combination of the rules from (1) and (2), but with green first (""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red"").
4. When ""bluf"" comes immediately after ""dax"" and is followed by other words, ""green"" seems to be repeated (""dax bluf lug wif"" -> ""green green blue red"").
5. And finally, a similar rule applies when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" with a different set of words after it (""dax bluf wif zup"" -> ""green green red yellow"").

From these observations, we can deduce a general rule:

Rule: When ""bluf"" is present, it instructs us to repeat the color output of the immediate preceding word, if the immediately preceding word is ""dax"" (to output ""green"") or ""lug"" (to output ""blue""). Otherwise, ""bluf"" does not seem to change the pattern of color outputs.

Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" seems contextually based on the presence and position of certain specific words like ""dax"" and ""lug.""

bluf -> meaning. When preceded by ""dax"" or ""lug,"" repeat the color output of that word (green for ""dax,"" blue for ""lug""). Otherwise, no discernible repeated effect on the color output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we look at the number of repeated color words in the output each time the word ""walm"" appears in the input.

- In the first example, ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"" – a repetition of three blues.
- In the second example, ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red,"" a repetition of red three times after one yellow.
- In the third example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" produces ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" where green appears three times after one yellow and before one yellow and one red.
- In the fourth example, we have ""lug walm"" again, producing ""blue blue blue,"" the same output as the first example, reinforcing the pattern.
- In the fifth example, ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green,"" where yellow is repeated three times consecutively immediately following the first instance of ""walm.""

Based on these examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" corresponds to the repetition of the color word that comes immediately before it, three times. Therefore:

walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, it is translated to the word ""blue.""
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"" consistently. In every instance where ""wif"" is mentioned, the output is ""red.""

So the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" seems to correspond with the color ""yellow."" The word does not appear to change its meaning based on its position in the sequence. Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm seems to transform the preceding word into the color it represents, and then repeats that color three additional times. For example, ""dax"" becomes ""green,"" and then it is followed by ""green green green."" 

Therefore, walm -> takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and then repeats that color three more times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" appears to correspond to the color ""green"" each time it is used, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" signifies the color green.
Based on the provided examples, wif is always translated to the color red, regardless of its position or the other words around it. Therefore, wif consistently corresponds to the color red.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" is associated with repeating the color of the word that comes before it.

Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, the word before ""bluf"" is ""dax,"" which corresponds to the color green. So, ""bluf"" translates to green here (""dax bluf"" -> ""green green"").
- In the second example, ""zup"" comes before ""bluf,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. So ""bluf"" becomes yellow (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- In the third example, ""wif"" which is red, comes before the first ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" which is green, comes before the second ""bluf."" So the first ""bluf"" corresponds to red and the second to green (""wif bluf dax bluf"" -> ""red red green green"").
- The fourth example is just ""dax"" followed by ""bluf,"" which is again ""green green.""
- In the fifth example, ""lug"" which is blue, comes before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" corresponds to blue here (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> The same color as the word before it.
From the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the pattern by analyzing the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Below are the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup walm              | Output: yellow yellow yellow
2. Input: lug zup dax walm      | Output: blue yellow green green green
3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup  | Output: green red red red blue yellow
4. Input: wif walm dax zup      | Output: red red red green yellow
5. Input: zup walm              | Output: yellow yellow yellow

To break down the pattern, let's examine the first and last examples, which are identical:

- Input: zup walm  | Output: yellow yellow yellow
- Input: zup walm  | Output: yellow yellow yellow

Given that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and the output repeats ""yellow"" three times, it may suggest that ""walm"" means to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it two additional times (resulting in a total of three times for that color).

Now let's check if this rule applies to the rest of the examples:

2. Input: lug zup dax walm      | Output: blue yellow green green green
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- Following our hypothesized rule, ""walm"" would repeat the color associated with ""dax"" (green) two more times.

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup  | Output: green red red red blue yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- Here, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and repeats the color ""red"" two more times.

4. Input: wif walm dax zup      | Output: red red red green yellow
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- The ""walm"" comes after and repeats ""red"" two additional times.

Based on the analysis, the rule appears to be consistent across the examples.

Rule: walm -> means to repeat the color of the word that precedes it two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Given the examples provided, the word 'lug' consistently translates to the color 'blue'. Therefore, it seems that the rule is:

Rule: lug means blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in all given examples.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is consistently ""red"". It appears that ""wif"" does not depend on context or position in the sequence for its meaning. It translates directly to ""red"" regardless of what other words are present or their order.

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sentence.
Rule: bluf -> red
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's inspect each line where it appears and compare it to the corresponding output:

1. Input: wif walm dax zup
   Output: red red red green yellow

2. Input: wif walm zup lug wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow blue red red red yellow

3. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

4. Input: lug walm wif
   Output: blue blue blue red

5. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue

- When ""walm"" appears in the input, the word immediately before ""walm"" ('the preceding word') has a corresponding output color that repeats three times, followed by the color corresponding to ""walm"".
- The colors that correspond to ""walm"" in each output are red, red, red, and blue in the last two cases where ""lug"" precedes ""walm"".
- ""Wif"" precedes ""walm"" in examples 1, 2, and 3, and it leads to the color red being repeated three times before a new color.
- ""Lug"" precedes ""walm"" in examples 4 and 5, and it leads to the color blue being repeated three times before a new color.
- In examples where a word does not precede ""walm"" (which aren't present), it is impossible to determine the output based on the given data.

Although the dataset is limited, the rule we can deduce from the information provided is:

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times, followed by the color blue if preceded by ""lug"" and red in other cases seen.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: When preceded by a particular word, ""walm"" causes that word's corresponding output color to be repeated three times, followed by ""walm""'s specific color output which depends on the preceding word (blue when preceded by lug, and red otherwise).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
According to the provided examples, it appears that the word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color blue.

Here is the analysis of each line to determine the meaning:

- Input: dax wif lug dax -> Output: green red blue green
  ""lug"" here is matched with ""blue"", and ""dax"" at both ends matches with ""green"".

- Input: wif dax wif lug wif -> Output: red green red blue red
  ""lug"" in this line also corresponds to ""blue"".

- Input: zup lug zup lug wif -> Output: yellow blue yellow blue red
  Here, ""lug"" appears twice, both times translating to ""blue"".

- Input: wif walm zup lug zup walm -> Output: red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
  ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in this sequence as well.

- Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
  And in this last example, ""lug"" is once again translated as ""blue"".

Therefore, based on the examples given, the rule can be stated as:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" in the given outputs. The color associated with ""dax"" is consistent across all examples.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" by looking at the corresponding outputs.

1. ""wif zup"" results in ""red yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
3. ""wif bluf zup"" results in ""red red yellow""
4. ""wif dax wif"" results in ""red green red""
5. ""dax wif"" results in ""green red""

Let's examine the patterns:

- Whenever ""wif"" appears, ""red"" is a part of the output.
- The order in which ""wif"" appears in the input seems to correspond to the order in which ""red"" appears in the output.

This gives us the rule:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""zup"" in the input correlates with the output color ""yellow."" Thus, regardless of its position or the other words present, ""zup"" consistently translates to the same color in the output sequences. The other words (""bluf"", ""lug"", ""dax"") each correspond to their own color as well (""yellow"", ""blue"", ""green"" respectively), but the instruction focuses specifically on the word ""zup.""

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" results in an output that repeats the color associated with the word that comes just before it.

- In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and when ""bluf"" follows, the output is another yellow.

- In the second example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" follows and the output is another green.

- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""bluf"" follows and the output is another green.

- In the fourth example, like the first, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and ""bluf"" causes the output to be another yellow.

- In the fifth example, ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""bluf"" results in another yellow; ""wif"" gives red, ""walm"" does not appear before ""bluf"" but seems to continue the pattern of red as in the word before it.

Rule: bluf -> causes the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that appears immediately before it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we should identify the patterns associated with the word and its position relative to other words and their respective outputs in color. Let's look at the examples given:

1. dax walm wif bluf -> green green green red red
2. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
3. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
4. wif lug zup walm wif lug -> red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

First, we notice that ""walm"" always precedes a sequence of identical colors in the output. The number of times this color appears also corresponds directly to the number of times ""walm"" appears. Additionally, it seems that ""walm"" affects the word that comes immediately after it.

Now let's try to deduce the rule for ""walm"" from the patterns we observe:

- In Example 1, ""walm"" precedes ""wif,"" and we see three greens before the pattern changes. This suggests that ""walm"" might correspond to repeating the color associated with the next word three times.
- In Example 2, ""walm"" is the last word, and we again see three repetitions, indicating that the pattern holds true even at the end of the sequence.
- Example 3 and 4 further support this pattern, as we see that ""walm"" causes the next word's color output to be repeated three times.

Taking all these observations into account, we now define the meaning of ""walm"":

Rule: When ""walm"" is used before another word, the color associated with the following word is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

From the given examples:
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue,"" and ""wif"" alone in another context translates to ""red,"" implying ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- ""lug dax lug"" translates to ""blue green blue,"" and ""dax"" alone in another context translates to ""green,"" implying that each instance of ""lug"" means ""blue.""
- ""wif walm lug bluf"" translates to ""red red red blue blue,"" and we know from previous examples that ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" often corresponds to ""blue"" (likely a plural or similar compound form). Thus, ""lug"" appears as ""blue"" once again.
- ""dax lug zup"" translates to ""green blue yellow,"" where ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" leaving ""lug"" to be ""blue.""
- ""lug zup dax walm"" translates to ""blue yellow green green green,"" where ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""walm"" does not correspond directly to a single color but may imply repetition, considering how it turns a single ""green"" into three. ""lug"" remains ""blue."" 

The consistent translation of ""lug"" across different sentences, despite the context, is ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Thus, we can deduce:

Rule: dax -> green. 

Meaning that ""dax"" corresponds to or signifies the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to correlate the nonce word ""bluf"" with the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. The color scheme referenced (green, blue, yellow, red) appears to be linked to certain words and ""bluf"" acts as a duplicator of the color of the preceding word.

For example:
- ""dax"" correlates to green, so ""bluf"" after ""dax"" also produces green.
- ""lug"" correlates to blue, so ""bluf"" after ""lug"" produces another blue.
- ""zup"" correlates to yellow, so ""bluf"" after ""zup"" results in another yellow.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color of the preceding word.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the word immediately preceding it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" across all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule for ""dax"" appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the sequence, ""wif"" always results in the color ""red"" in the output. Thus, we can deduce that:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" irrespective of its position or context within a sequence.
The word ""zup"" does not have a consistent, single color output across the examples; however, ""zup"" always corresponds to the color yellow in every instance where it appears. This suggests that the word ""zup"" in this context signifies the color yellow.

Therefore, the rule is:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's examine the patterns between the input and the output sequences.

Input: zup wif bluf
Output: yellow red red

Input: lug wif bluf
Output: blue red red

In the first two examples, the word ""bluf"" is at the end, and both outputs end in ""red red."" ""Wif"" seems to cause ""red"" as the first output color when ""bluf"" follows since ""zup"" and ""lug"" lead to ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively. So, it seems ""bluf"" might correspond to ""red"" when it is the last word. But let's analyze more examples to see if this pattern holds.

Input: dax bluf wif zup
Output: green green red yellow

Here ""bluf"" is in the middle and is followed by ""wif zup."" The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" (from previous examples), and again ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" So it appears that when ""bluf"" is between ""dax"" and ""wif,"" it outputs ""green."" However, ""green"" is already paired with ""dax"" so this might not be conclusive. 

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

In this input, ""bluf"" occurs twice and ""lug"" is before each occurrence. Both times, it is followed by ""wif"" and then the first time ""lug"" again and the second time ""zup."" The outputs here are interesting: we have ""blue blue red"" for ""lug bluf wif"" and ""blue blue yellow"" for ""lug bluf zup."" The presence of ""wif"" after ""bluf"" still produces ""red"" but the color before it is ""blue,"" which corresponds to ""lug.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

In this last example, ""bluf"" appears twice. The first instance is after ""dax"" and is followed by ""wif zup,"" leading to ""green red yellow."" The second occurrence is after ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" which gives ""yellow yellow blue."" Considering ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue,"" we observe that ""bluf"" doesn't affect the next color which is based on the following word.

So, the pattern seems complicated, but here's what we can deduce from the given example:

1. When ""bluf"" comes before ""wif,"" it causes an output of ""red,"" regardless of the prior word.
2. When ""bluf"" is followed by any other word except ""wif,"" the next color is not affected by ""bluf,"" and is instead determined by the word that follows ""bluf.""

Rule:
bluf -> a rule that corresponds to the color ""red"" when it precedes the word ""wif,"" otherwise it does not have an independent color meaning and its impact is contextually dependent on the sequence of words.
Analyzing the provided examples, let's see how ""walm"" is used in conjunction with other words:

1. Input: zup wif walm   
   Output: yellow red red red
   
2. Input: dax lug walm   
   Output: green blue blue blue
   
3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm   
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow
   
4. Input: dax walm wif zup   
   Output: green green green red yellow
   
5. Input: dax walm   
   Output: green green green

Examining the patterns:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" The first color corresponds to ""zup,"" and the next three are identical and associated with ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green blue blue blue."" The first color corresponds to ""dax,"" and the next three are identical and associated with ""walm.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is ""red red red."" The first color corresponds to ""wif,"" and the next three are identical and associated with ""walm.""

The rule seems to be: when ""walm"" appears after a word, the output color for ""walm"" is three repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word. 

So based on the information provided:

walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be the color ""blue.""

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Every instance of ""dax"" in the input examples translates to ""green"" in the output examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" appears to consistently correspond to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. No matter where ""wif"" appears or how many times it is repeated, the output color associated with ""wif"" remains constant.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided:

- Every time the word ""zup"" appears, the output is ""yellow"".
- ""Zup"" does not seem to depend on position or surrounding words to determine its output.
- ""Zup"" consistently translates to a single color regardless of the context in which it appears.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Analyzing the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"" by finding patterns in the input and output.

In each instance where ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output consists of two identical color words. Let's consider each case:

1. Input: zup lug zup bluf lug | Output: yellow blue yellow yellow blue
2. Input: dax bluf | Output: green green
3. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red
4. Input: lug dax bluf | Output: blue green green
5. Input: wif bluf | Output: red red

A pattern emerges when we look at the word that appears immediately before ""bluf"":

1. ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", and in both cases where ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" appears in the output.
2. ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""green"" follows in the output.
3. ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", and ""red"" follows in the output.
4. In the sequence ""lug dax bluf"", ""dax"" is the word before ""bluf"", and the corresponding output repeats ""green"".

This pattern suggests that ""bluf"" causes the color word corresponding to the immediately preceding word to be repeated twice in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word in the input sequence, the output sequence will contain the color word corresponding to that preceding word twice in a row.

Bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the output.
walm -> meaning. Looking at the examples, the word 'walm' produces three words of the same color back to back. However, that color changes dependent on the context.

Rule: 'walm' replicates the color of the word immediately preceding it, producing it three times. For instance, if 'wif' (red) comes before 'walm,' the output is 'red red red.' If 'dax' (green) comes before 'walm,' the output is 'green green green,' and so on.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup dax
    ",Output: blue yellow green,blue yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""lug"" appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue

This rule seems consistent across all examples given, as every instance of ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- Whenever the word ""dax"" appears, the word ""green"" is its corresponding output.
- ""Dax"" does not seem to change meaning based on its position in the input.
- The other words in the input have their own corresponding colors, but ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green.""

Given the data we have, the most logical deduction is that ""dax"" directly maps to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> meaning. Rule: From the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- In the first example, ""dax wif"" translates to ""green red"", so we may infer that ""dax"" is ""green"" and ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""dax lug wif"" translates to ""green blue red,"" further indicating ""dax"" is ""green"", ""lug"" is ""blue"", and ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In the third example, ""zup wif dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red green red red"". The double presence of ""wif"" both times corresponds to the color ""red"", and ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"", which supports the idea that ""wif"" is ""red"" as it is the second color in the output.
- The fifth example, ""wif dax wif"", translates to ""red green red"", and once again, each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".

Thus, the rule appears to be: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in each given example, regardless of position or surrounding words.
Based on the examples provided, the rule appears to be:

**Rule:** The word ""bluf"" translates to a color, and this color is determined by the word immediately preceding ""bluf."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" translates to ""blue."" The word ""wif"" contributes ""red"" to the output but it does not influence the translation of ""bluf.""

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

**bluf -> meaning.** The meaning is determined by the preceding word and follows this mapping:
- If preceded by ""zup"" -> ""yellow""
- If preceded by ""lug"" -> ""blue""
walm -> meaning. Meaning appears to be repetition; the word ""walm"" causes the preceding color to be repeated multiple times.

Rule:
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""zup,"" the color red is repeated three times (as seen in ""zup wif walm"" -> ""yellow red red red"").
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""dax,"" the color green is repeated; the number of repetitions is equal to the number of words from ""dax"" until ""walm"" (as seen in ""zup wif dax walm"" -> ""yellow red green green green"" and ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow"").
- If the word before ""walm"" is ""lug,"" the color blue is repeated; the number of repetitions is not clear from the given examples, as there is only one example where ""lug"" precedes ""walm."" In that case, it is repeated three times considering the addition of ""wif lug"" at the end (as seen in ""lug walm wif lug"" -> ""blue blue blue red blue""). However, ""wif"" does not affect the outcome, so it's possible that ""lug"" always results in blue being repeated three times when followed by ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green,blue red green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" Whenever ""dax"" is an input, ""green"" is part of the output. There is insufficient information to deduce the meanings of the other words (""zup,"" ""walm,"" ""wif,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf""), but ""dax"" clearly is associated with ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" is used in the input, the output includes ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the sequence of words.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""bluf,"" let's examine the input and output pairs and establish the context for each occurrence of ""bluf.""

First, let's line up each input with its corresponding output:

1. Input: wif dax bluf       | Output: red green green
2. Input: lug bluf wif       | Output: blue blue red
3. Input: dax bluf wif zup   | Output: green green red yellow
4. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug | Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
5. Input: lug dax bluf       | Output: blue green green

We will try to match words in the input with the colors in the output:

- ""wif"" always corresponds to ""red.""
- ""lug"" always corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" always corresponds to ""green.""
- ""zup"" always corresponds to ""yellow.""

With these associations, we observe that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the immediately preceding word's output color:

1. dax (green) bluf (green)
2. lug (blue) bluf (blue)
3. dax (green) bluf (green)
4. zup (yellow) bluf (yellow)
5. dax (green) bluf (green)

According to this pattern, ""bluf"" means ""repeat the color of the previous word.""

Rule: bluf -> repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, it can be deduced that the nonce word ""walm"" indicates the repetition of the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes ""walm"". The number of repetitions is three times. Using the examples to confirm this rule:

1. ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow"". ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and it is repeated three times.
2. ""zup wif dax walm lug"" translates to ""yellow red green green green blue"". ""dax"" corresponds to green, and following ""walm"", green is repeated three times before moving on to ""lug"" which is blue.
3. ""zup wif walm"" yields ""yellow red red red"". As previously, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and it is repeated three times after ""walm"".
4. ""dax walm wif walm zup"" results in ""green green green red red red yellow"". Each occurrence of ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color of the word before it, three times.
5. ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"". ""dax"" is equivalent to green, thus it is repeated three times following ""walm"".

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax lug walm
    ",Output: yellow green blue blue blue blue,yellow green blue blue blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue
From the given examples, we can induce the following:

1. Whenever the word ""dax"" appears alone, the output is ""green"":
   Input: dax
   Output: green
   
2. When ""dax"" appears followed by ""walm"", the output is multiple ""green"":
   Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   
   This indicates that there might be a rule where ""walm"" following ""dax"" multiplies the output.

3. When ""dax"" appears followed by ""walm"" and then ""zup lug"", the output is ""green"" for each occurrence of ""walm"" followed by colors that vary for ""zup"" and ""lug"":
   Input: dax walm zup lug dax
   Output: green green green yellow blue green

   This suggests that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". However, the output for ""dax"" remains consistently ""green"".
   
4. The word ""wif"" follows ""dax"" and the output color is ""red"":
   Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

   The above input indicates that ""wif"" may output a single ""red"" but the following ""walm"" seems to output additional ""red"". This example does not provide enough clarity on the behavior of ""wif"" and ""walm"".

From these observations, the most consistent rule that we can induce is:

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"". This rule is supported by every occurrence of ""dax"" leading to the output ""green"". The behavior of ""walm"", ""zup"", ""lug"", and ""wif"" vary and are not as consistent, making it difficult to extract specific rules for their output without additional examples or information. 

Thus:

dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently maps to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output consistently includes ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following rules for determining the output colors given the input words:

1. lug is consistently mapped to blue.
2. wif is consistently mapped to red.
3. dax is consistently mapped to green.
4. walm is consistently mapped to yellow.

With each example, the input sequence has the word zup flanked by other words that map to specific colors in the output sequence. In each case, regardless of what word comes before or after zup, the word zup itself is followed by the output color yellow.

Therefore, we can induce that the word zup maps to the color yellow. The fact that its placement in the input doesn't seem to affect surrounding words further supports this conclusion.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeated color

Rule: ""bluf"" means to repeat the color word that comes immediately before it. In the context of the examples provided, if ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" then ""zup bluf"" results in ""yellow yellow."" Similarly, if ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" then ""wif bluf"" yields ""red red."" The repetition count of the color word is one less than the number of syllables in ""bluf."" Thus, ""bluf"" causes the preceding color word to be output twice.
The examples provided indicate that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it three times.

Here's the breakdown of the given examples:

Example 1:
- wif -> red
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

The output ""red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue"" suggests that ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times.

Example 2:
- lug -> blue
- dax -> green (new information from this example)

The output ""blue green green green"" implies that ""walm"" after ""dax"" causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Example 3:
- zup -> yellow

With the output ""yellow yellow yellow,"" ""walm"" after ""zup"" leads to ""yellow"" being repeated three times, consistent with prior examples.

Example 4 provides the same data as Example 3 and leads to the same conclusion.

Example 5 combines previously seen elements:
- zup -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- bluf -> not used before but by process of elimination is ""red"" (since we see ""red red"" at the end of the output)

With the output ""yellow yellow yellow blue red red,"" the pattern is consistent, with ""walm"" after ""zup"" leading to ""yellow"" being repeated three times. The word ""bluf,"" which has not appeared previously, is followed in the output by ""red red,"" suggesting that ""bluf"" is similar to ""wif"" in meaning and thus associated with the color ""red.""

Rule:
walm -> causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine where it occurs and the corresponding output:

- In the first example, ""dax"" comes before ""walm wif zup"" and the output is ""green green green red yellow."" In this string, ""walm"" is followed by ""green,"" ""wif"" is followed by ""red,"" and ""zup"" is followed by ""yellow."" Since ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" the immediate output for ""dax"" is ""green.""

- In the second and third examples, ""dax"" is the only input, and the output is consistently ""green.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax"" is followed by ""wif"" with outputs ""green red,"" adhering to the rule noted from earlier outputs that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

- The fifth example is a longer sequence, where ""wif dax zup wif dax bluf"" leads to ""red green yellow red green green."" Near the end, we have ""dax bluf"" resulting in ""green green,"" suggesting that ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green"" and introducing ""bluf"" also corresponds to ""green.""

From these observations, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" Therefore, the rule seems to be that every instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""red"" regardless of its position or the context in the sentence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears, it corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, we can infer the following:

1. In the first example, ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow,"" which suggests that 'zup' and 'bluf' both mean 'yellow'.
2. In the second example, ""zup bluf dax lug"" translates to ""yellow yellow green blue,"" with 'dax' meaning 'green' and 'lug' meaning 'blue'. Here 'bluf' appears between 'zup' (yellow) and 'dax' (green) and since its translation is also 'yellow', it shows that the meaning of 'bluf' does not change with position.
3. In the third example, ""dax bluf wif lug zup"" translates to ""green green red blue yellow,"" and here 'wif' is shown to mean 'red'. 'bluf' appears between 'dax' (green) and 'wif' (red). It still means 'yellow'.
4. In the fourth example, ""lug zup bluf dax"" translates to ""blue yellow yellow green,"" and just like the previous examples, 'bluf' follows 'zup' (known as 'yellow') and is also translated as 'yellow'.
5. In the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow red red,"" and given the pattern, 'bluf' should translate to 'yellow'. However, in this example, it is translated to 'red', which does not fit the pattern observed so far.

The first four examples suggest a consistent meaning for 'bluf'—it translates to 'yellow'. The last example is an anomaly based on the information given, as 'bluf' translates to 'red'. Assuming there is no error in the examples, this discrepancy is difficult to explain with the given data and appears to break the pattern.

Based on the consistent meaning in the first four examples, the rule we can infer is:
bluf -> yellow

Meaning: 'bluf' means 'yellow'.

However, we must note that the fifth example contradicts this rule and no explanation can be provided for this inconsistency with the given data. If the examples are presumed to be correct, we might suspect an unexplained context-sensitive rule affecting the translation of 'bluf' in the last example.
walm -> green. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm dax
    ",Output: yellow green green,yellow yellow yellow green,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples where the nonce word ""lug"" is used, we can deduce the following pattern:

Whenever ""lug"" is mentioned in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the meaning of ""lug"" is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red 

The rule derived from the examples provided suggests that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output, independent of its position or the context in which it appears.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided.
From the given examples, we can observe the relationship between the input and output strings to isolate the meaning of the word ""bluf"". Let us examine the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. ""lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug"" -> ""blue blue red blue red red red blue""
2. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
3. ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" -> ""green yellow red red blue""
4. ""wif bluf"" -> ""red red""
5. ""dax lug bluf wif"" -> ""green blue blue red""

In every case, the output color that follows ""bluf"" is the same color as the one that precedes it with one exception, where ""walm"" is out of pattern, likely because it changes the subsequent color:

- In example 1, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""blue.""
- In example 2, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""red.""
- In examples 3 and 4, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"" and followed by ""red.""
- In example 5, ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" and followed by ""blue.""

Therefore, it seems the rule is that ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the previous word.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" contributes to the repetition of a color in the output sequence. Examining the input that does not include ""walm"" helps in isolating its effect:

1. ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
2. ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" in the output.
3. ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
4. ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.

When ""walm"" is present in the input:

- In example 1, ""zup wif dax walm"" translates to ""yellow red green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated multiple times.
- In example 2, ""lug walm dax"" results in ""blue blue blue green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated before the ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In example 3, ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red,"" where ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" repeated before proceeding with the normal sequence.
- In example 4, ""dax lug walm"" results in ""green blue blue blue,"" where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated after the ""green"" for ""dax.""
- In example 5, ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated.

From the pattern, it's clear that ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it to repeat three times in total. It appears that, regardless of what word ""walm"" follows, the rule is consistent. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> Causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" to be repeated three times in total in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green. Whenever ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the output.
From the examples provided, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". 

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the given examples, every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow."" It appears that ""zup"" directly translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words around it.
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word 'bluf' consistently translates to the color 'blue' in every example given.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" is consistently translated to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which implies that ""walm"" corresponds to a tripling of the color yellow.

Rule: walm -> ""yellow yellow yellow""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax wif
    ",Output: blue green red,blue green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, it appears that ""lug"" translates to ""blue."" Here's the reasoning:

- In the first example, the word ""lug"" corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
- In the second example, ""lug"" again corresponds to ""blue,"" and it appears regardless of the surrounding words.
- Similarly, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, every instance of ""lug"" aligns with the word ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue
dax -> green. 

Rule: In each example, the word dax corresponds directly to the color green in the output.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red,"" regardless of the context. Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" is the first color in the corresponding output sequence.

For instance:

- In the first example, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" so we can infer that ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- In the second example, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red."" Since ""bluf"" is matched with ""red"" here and there's no other context to suggest that ""bluf"" can result in a different color, we can deduce that ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- In the third example, ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" and ""dax"" each correspond to colors mentioned previously, but ""zup"" is new and positioned before ""yellow"" so it likely corresponds to ""yellow."" The initial ""wif"" still corresponds to ""red.""
- In the fourth and fifth examples, ""wif"" stands alone or is followed by ""dax,"" and in both cases, ""red"" is part of the output right after ""wif"" is in the input.

Considering these observations, we can establish the following rule:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern that associates each word with a color. Here's what we can deduce:

- Whenever ""zup"" appears, ""yellow"" is produced in the output.
- The word ""lug"" is associated with ""blue"".
- The word ""wif"" is associated with ""red"".
- The word ""walm"" produces multiple ""red"" outputs, except when preceded by ""lug.""

Using these observations, we can infer the following:

zup -> ""yellow""

Given that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input or the other words around it, we can conclude that ""zup"" means ""yellow.""

Rule: The presence of the word ""zup"" in the input results in the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: The nonce word ""bluf"" translates to the English word ""red"" when following the word ""wif,"" and it translates to the word ""blue"" when following the word ""lug."" If ""bluf"" follows any other word or sequence, its meaning is not consistent based on the given examples.

bluf -> ""red"" when following ""wif""
bluf -> ""blue"" when following ""lug""
Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to represent a repetition of the color associated with the word that precedes it.

Verification of the rule:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm,"" the output is ""red red red,"" which is a repetition of the color represented by ""wif.""

- In the second example, ""walm"" follows the sequence ""lug wif,"" where ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""wif"" to red. The output after ""walm"" is ""red red red blue,"" which is a repetition of the color red (associated with ""wif"") three times, followed by blue (associated with ""lug"").

- In the third example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""dax"" is associated with green. The output is ""green green green,"" which is a repetition of the color green.

- The fourth example is similar to the third one, with ""zup"" associated with yellow followed by ""walm,"" yielding ""yellow yellow yellow.""

- In the fifth example, ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" and ""dax"" is associated with green. The output is ""green green green,"" repeating the color associated with ""dax.""

Based on the provided examples, ""walm"" appears not to be a translation to a specific color but a rule that the color of the preceding word is to be repeated three times in the output.

Walm -> meaning: Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue,yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the input and output pairs provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Here's how we arrive at this conclusion:

- When the input is just ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" is accompanied by other words, no matter their position, the corresponding output for ""dax"" is still ""green.""

Furthermore, we can infer some potential rules for the other words:

- ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" as every instance of ""lug"" in the input results in ""blue"" in the output.
- ""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" as every instance of ""zup"" in the input results in ""yellow"" in the output.
- ""wif"" seems to correspond to ""red,"" as every instance of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output.

We can't infer the meaning of the word ""walm"" from one instance alone, as it's not clear if ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" or if its output color is based on a more complex rule that we cannot discern with the given examples. The word ""bluf"" similarly cannot be confidently assigned a meaning from just one instance, and so it is not part of the analysis.

Therefore, the rule appears to be:
dax -> green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" I will look at the patterns before and after each instance of ""wif"" and the corresponding output.

Here are the instances of ""wif"" from the inputs and their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif                Output: yellow red
2. Input: wif bluf                Output: red red
3. Input: dax wif bluf            Output: green red red
4. Input: wif dax zup wif        Output: red green yellow red
5. Input: lug walm zup lug zup wif  Output: blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red

Based on these examples, ""wif"" always translates to ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input. There doesn't appear to be a contextual dependence or change in the meaning based on surrounding words. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: ""wif"" always corresponds to the color ""red.""

wif -> red
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the same position in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze the correlation between the input words and the color outputs.

1. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
2. wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue
3. dax bluf wif zup lug -> green green red yellow blue
4. zup bluf lug -> yellow yellow blue
5. wif bluf lug -> red red blue

By looking at the above examples, it seems that ""bluf"" might be related to the color repetition in the output. Notice that each time ""bluf"" appears, the color just before it is repeated:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to green and following ""bluf"" there are two greens.
- In the second example, ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"" and the output gives two blues after three reds.
- In the third example, ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red) surround ""bluf,"" leading to a repetition of green and then red.
- The fourth and fifth examples repeat the color corresponding to ""zup"" (yellow) and ""wif"" (red) respectively.

Rule: bluf -> causes the color corresponding to the word immediately before it to be repeated in the output.
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

Rule: When walm is used in a sequence, it takes the color associated with the word immediately before it and repeats that color three more times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" always results in the output ""blue.""

So the rule seems to be:
lug -> blue

Rule: When the nonce word ""lug"" is an input, the corresponding output is the color ""blue.""
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" appears to be as follows:

Whenever the word ""dax"" is said, the output is ""green."" This pattern holds true regardless of the words that precede or follow it in the inputs provided. 

Additionally, there are other words and patterns to note:
- The word ""lug"" consistently results in the output ""blue,"" again regardless of its position in the sequence.
- The word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the output ""green."" However, the first example shows a sequence where ""lug dax walm"" leads to a ""red"" output before returning to ""green."" This could suggest an interaction effect or a more complex rule, but the given examples don't provide enough information to deduce the specifics of this interaction.
- The word ""zup"" has only appeared once, and the corresponding output is ""yellow,"" so with the available information, it can be tentatively assumed that ""zup"" results in ""yellow.""

Based on these observations, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
Rule: ""zup"" seems to indicate the color ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input sequence. It does not appear to be context-dependent.

Therefore:

zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Based on the given examples, bluf means repeating the color word before it.

Rule: When bluf appears in a sequence, it indicates that the color word immediately preceding it should be duplicated. For example, if ""wif"" (red) precedes ""bluf,"" the output will include ""red"" twice. If ""lug"" (blue) precedes ""bluf,"" the output will include ""blue"" twice, and so on.
Walm -> ""repeat the last color mentioned three times""

Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in the input, it results in the last color mentioned being repeated three consecutive times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> ""yellow""

Applying the rule to the examples:

- ""zup lug"" translates to ""yellow blue""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf"" translates to ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red""
- ""zup bluf"" translates to ""yellow yellow""
- ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
bluf -> repeats the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: When bluf follows another color word (wif, zup, dax, lug), it takes on the same color value as the word that precedes it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the previous color

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
Based on the above examples, the rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"" seems to be dependent on its position relative to other words, as it always corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. It does not show any variation depending on adjacent words; ""dax"" leads to ""green"" regardless of the words that come before or after it. Other words like ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and so forth correspond to other colors like ""red,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" when they precede or follow ""dax.""

Therefore, the rule can be defined as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red in the output sequence. Each occurrence of ""wif"" in the input results in ""red"" being in the respective position in the output.
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output regardless of the other words (or nonce words) around it. Thus, the rule induced from the examples is:

zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""bluf"" is being translated as ""red"" regardless of its position in a sequence or the surrounding words. Here is the pattern observed from the examples:

- When ""wif"" is present, the output is ""red"".
- When ""dax"" is present, the output is ""green"".
- When ""zup"" is present, the output is ""yellow"".
- When ""lug"" is present, the output is ""blue"".

In every instance, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"". Thus, the meaning of ""bluf"" appears consistent:

Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to repeating the last color mentioned in the output. Analyzing the patterns in each given Input/Output set:

1. 'zup dax walm' translates to 'yellow green green green.' Here, 'walm' results in repeating 'green' three times.
2. 'dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax' translates to 'green blue blue blue green red red green.' In this sequence, 'walm' yields 'blue' repeated three times.
3. 'zup bluf wif walm' translates to 'yellow yellow red red red.' Here, 'walm' corresponds to repeating 'red' three times.
4. 'wif walm zup lug zup walm' translates to 'red red red yellow blue yellow yellow yellow.' In this example, the first 'walm' results in repeating 'red' twice more, and the second 'walm' results in repeating 'yellow' three times.
5. 'lug dax walm' translates to 'blue green green green.' Once again, 'walm' corresponds to repeating the previous color, 'green,' three times.

Based on this pattern, the rule for 'walm' is that it causes the last color mentioned to be repeated three times. 

Rule: walm -> Repeat the last mentioned color three times.

    Rules:

The examples provided indicate a consistent pattern where each word is translated to a color. The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green,"" while the other words translate to other colors consistently. The translations appear to be as follows:

- ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"".
- ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"".
- ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"".

Using these translations, the following rule can be deduced:

Rule: dax means green.
wif -> red

Rule:
The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow.""

Thus, the rule is:

zup -> yellow.
bluf -> red when following ""wif"" and blue when following ""dax"" or ""lug"". Rule: The color associated with ""bluf"" depends on the preceding word.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" translates to an action that duplicates the color word that comes before it. Each instance of ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color word associated with the word that precedes it. 

For example, in the first input, ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue""; in the second input, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green""; in the third input, ""zup lug zup walm"" leads to ""yellow blue yellow yellow"", repeating the blue; and in the fourth input, ""dax walm"" again results in ""green green"".

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that each word has a color associated with it, and ""dax"" reliably translates to the color ""green."" Here's the breakdown:

- In every input where ""dax"" appears, the corresponding output is ""green.""
- Other words seem to correspond with different colors consistently as well. For example, ""wif"" matches ""red,"" ""lug"" matches ""blue,"" ""walm"" matches ""blue,"" and ""zup"" matches ""yellow.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" is:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" when included in a sequence of words. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position within the input sequence. Therefore, the rule for the word ""zup"" seems to be a direct mapping to the color yellow without any context dependency.

Rule: zup -> yellow

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. 

Rule:
Based on the examples, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of context. The additional words appear to translate as follows: ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" and ""bluf"" both translate to ""blue"". Thus, ""lug"" on its own or when followed by other words results in ""blue"" appearing first in the output sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output, irrespective of its position or the presence of other words in the input.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the examples, the corresponding output includes the color ""red."" Therefore, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can observe the following:

- When ""zup"" appears after ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears after ""dax,"" the output repeats ""yellow"" thrice.
- When ""zup"" appears after ""walm,"" there is no direct example, but given the pattern after ""dax"" it's likely that it would repeat ""yellow"" twice (as ""walm"" corresponds to ""green"" twice).

From these observations, we can induce that ""zup"" may mean to repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""zup"" with ""yellow"" following the pattern of repetition observed. For ""lug"" and ""wif"" there is no repetition, but for ""dax,"" the color green is repeated twice followed by yellow repeated thrice.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be to output the color associated with the preceding word, and if the preceding word is ""dax,"" additionally repeat ""yellow"" twice more (creating a triplet of ""yellow"").

Rule: zup -> Repeat the color of the word that comes before ""zup,"" and if that word is ""dax,"" output two additional ""yellow"" colors.
Rule: bluf -> the color word immediately preceding it.
walm -> meaning. Looking at the pattern of outputs, it seems that ""walm"" translates to a color, but the color it translates to varies depending on the word(s) that come before it. Examining the specific color patterns in the outputs, it correlates to the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm."" For example:

- In 'wif walm zup', ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, so ""walm"" is also red. 
- In 'dax lug walm', ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, so ""walm"" is also blue. 
- In 'zup walm', ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow so ""walm"" is also yellow.
- In 'lug dax walm', ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, and ""walm"" is green here.
- In 'wif walm zup lug zup walm', ""walm"" follows directly after ""zup"" twice, which corresponds to yellow, so in both cases, ""walm"" translates to yellow.

Rule: The meaning of ""walm"" changes to match the color of the word that precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> meaning. Meaning: red

Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following meanings for the words including ""zup"":

- The word ""zup"" when it appears by itself signifies the color ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" when followed by ""bluf"" signifies the color ""red"" twice (as the output is ""red red"" when ""wif bluf"" is inputted).
- The word ""walm"" signifies repeating the color previously mentioned three times (as the output is ""yellow yellow yellow"" when ""zup walm"" is inputted).
- The word ""lug"" signifies the color ""blue.""

From this, we can deduce that ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""bluf,"" let's look at the patterns in the input and output pairs provided.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Input: dax bluf
Output: green green

Following patterns can be deduced:

- ""bluf"" after ""wif"" yields red.
- ""bluf"" after ""lug"" yields blue.
- ""bluf"" after ""dax"" yields green.
- In all cases, the output of ""bluf"" matches the output of the word that precedes it.
  
Therefore, the general rule seems to be:

Rule: ""bluf"" -> takes the color of the preceding word. If the preceding word represents a color, ""bluf"" repeats that same color.
Observing the patterns between the input and the output, here's what we can deduce from each instance:

- The word ""walm"" always corresponds with a sequence of a color being repeated.
- The color that ""walm"" corresponds with is the color that directly follows ""walm"" in the output.
- The count of the repeated colors is not clear from the input (i.e., ""walm"" doesn't tell us how many times the color will be repeated); this might depend on other words or rules in the sequence.

Let's analyze each sentence:

1. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" repeated three times.

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the output is ""green"" repeated three times.

3. Input: dax walm wif lug dax walm
   Output: green green green red blue green green green
   Here ""walm"" occurs twice; first after ""dax,"" producing ""green"" repeated, and second following another ""dax,"" again producing ""green"" repeated.

4. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   In this example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

5. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   Here ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

From this, we can infer that ""walm"" indicates repetition of the next color mentioned in the sequence, and based on these examples, it's a repetition of three times. However, it's essential to note that with only these five examples, we cannot determine if ""walm"" is always a triple repetition or if the number of repetitions may vary in other unseen examples.

Rule: walm -> indicates that the next color in the sequence should be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Rules:
Based on the examples given, each word translates to a unique color:

- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- walm -> green green green
- zup -> yellow

When ""lug"" appears, the output always includes ""blue,"" regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, ""lug"" translates to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example provided.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red red

Taking into account the patterns in the provided examples, it can be inferred that the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red red"" in the output, regardless of the other words and their corresponding colors.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's consider the input and the corresponding output for each example:

1. **Input:** wif walm
   **Output:** red red red

   From this example, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red.""

2. **Input:** dax walm zup walm
   **Output:** green green green yellow yellow yellow

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Each instance of ""walm"" following these words seems to repeat the color of the word preceding it three times.

3. **Input:** dax lug walm
   **Output:** green blue blue blue

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue."" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" three times.

4. **Input:** dax walm
   **Output:** green green green

   ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" Following the pattern, ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.

5. **Input:** lug walm dax
   **Output:** blue blue blue green

   ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and repeats ""blue"" three times.

Considering the above examples, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the word immediately preceding it, three times. If it is the first word and no color is available to repeat, it defaults to repeating ""red.""

**Rule:**
walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times. If ""walm"" is the first word, the color to be repeated is ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup bluf
    ",Output: yellow red red,yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue. When combined with other nonce words like ""zup"" or ""walm,"" it maintains its meaning, and the other nonce words add additional colors or repeat the color depending on the word. For instance, ""zup"" adds yellow, and ""walm"" repeats blue two more times.
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following rules for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

- When ""dax"" appears at the beginning of the input, the first color in the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears in the middle of the input, the color corresponding to its position in the output is ""green.""
- When ""dax"" stands alone as an input, the output is solely ""green.""

From these observations, we can deduce that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output regardless of its position in the input. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, every instance of the word ""wif"" directly translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position or the context within the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" appears to correspond with the output ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is mentioned in the input, the word ""yellow"" is produced in the output. 

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to consistently correspond to the output ""red,"" regardless of its position within the input sequence. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input results in ""red"" in the output, suggesting that ""walm"" directly translates to the color red.

Rule: walm -> red

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the outputs. There is no example given that contradicts this correlation. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words. There is no context to indicate that ""zup"" changes meaning based on surrounding words or any other factors.

Thus, the rule induced from the examples is:

zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the input-output pairs and the apparent color-coding system where each word seems to correlate to a color, the word ""bluf"" appears to consistently correspond to ""red"" unless it follows the word ""lug"", where it instead corresponds to ""blue"".

Bluf -> meaning:

If the word prior to ""bluf"" is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" In any other context, ""bluf"" means ""red"".

Rule:
- ""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue""
- In all other cases, ""bluf"" -> ""red""
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" is associated with the repetition of the color that corresponds to the word that immediately precedes it. When ""walm"" is present, the color that matches the previous word is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" mandates. Here are the mappings we can deduce from the examples:

- ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
- ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""bluf"" also corresponds to the color yellow.
- ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Let's examine the patterns in the examples:

- In the second input ""dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"", which maps to green, and the output is ""green green green"". Hence, ""walm"" seems to cause the previous color to be outputted three times.
- In the third input ""wif bluf dax walm"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and again, the color green is repeated three times in the output.
- In the fifth input, ""lug dax walm wif"", ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and three greens are outputted before the final ""wif"" red.
- In the fourth input ""wif zup walm dax zup"", ""walm"" follows ""zup"", and the pattern is disrupted with ""yellow yellow"" instead of three yellows. This could be because 'walm' occurs in the middle of the sequence and is immediately followed by a different word, 'dax', so it didn't have the chance to repeat the color three times.

Taking into account the fourth example as a possible exception or a different contextual usage, the general rule could be as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word, it usually results in the corresponding color being repeated three times, unless ""walm"" is immediately followed by a different color word, in which case the repetition could be less than three times or the pattern could be disrupted.

However, with the limited examples provided and the possible exception seen in the fourth example, it's possible that the exact rule for ""walm"" may need further context or examples to be precisely defined.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in the outputs, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, whenever ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green.""
Observing the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the words around it. Here is the rule I have induced:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" always translates to the color ""red.""
From the examples provided, the pattern suggests that each word is associated with a specific color:

- lug -> blue
- walm -> red
- wif -> red
- dax -> green

The word ""zup"" appears to consistently result in the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the context of other words around it. 

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, the word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""red"" every time it is preceded by the word ""wif,"" and to the color ""blue"" when it is not preceded by ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""bluf"" appears to be:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it translates to ""red.""
- When ""bluf"" does not follow ""wif,"" it translates to ""blue.""

Rule: bluf -> ""red"" if preceded by ""wif""; otherwise, ""blue.""
Analyzing the provided examples and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax zup dax walm
   Output: green yellow green green green

2. Input: wif lug zup walm wif lug
   Output: red blue yellow yellow yellow red blue

3. Input: dax wif walm lug zup
   Output: green red red red blue yellow

4. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

5. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

From the data provided, it's observable that the output associated with ""walm"" is a repetition of the color immediately preceding it, three times.

In examples 1, 2, and 5, ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which results in ""yellow"" being repeated three times. In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which results in ""red"" being said three times. Last, in example 4, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> It repeats the meaning (color) of the word before it three times.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color blue in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, whenever the word dax appears in the input, the color green appears in the output at the corresponding position. Thus, dax seems to translate to the color green, regardless of its position in the sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, we can infer that the word 'zup' translates to the color 'yellow.' Every instance of 'zup' in the input is followed by 'yellow' in the corresponding output. 

Additionally, we can note that other words translate consistently to particular colors as well:

- 'wif' -> red
- 'lug' -> blue
- 'dax' -> green

Given this, the rule for 'zup' seems to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can infer that each nonce word is mapped to a specific color in the outputs. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color corresponding to the word just before ""walm"" three times.

Here are the observations:

1. When ""walm"" follows ""zup"", the output is ""green green green"". In the first example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", but it is followed by ""dax"" which corresponds to ""green"". The ""walm"" then repeats ""green"" three times, as seen in the sequence ""yellow green green green"".

2. When ""walm"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red red"". In the second example, ""wif"" again is followed by ""walm"", and the three ""red"" colors are repeated.

3. The third example, ""wif walm"", solidifies the rule as it directly follows ""wif"" with ""walm"" and the output is simply ""red red red"".

4. When ""walm"" follows ""lug"", the output is ""blue blue blue"". This is observed in the fourth example, ""lug walm"" resulting in ""blue blue blue"", and is consistent with the established pattern.

5. The final example, ""lug walm wif bluf"", incorporates both ""lug"" and ""wif"" before and after ""walm"" respectively. Following the pattern, ""lug"" leads to three ""blue"" colors and then ""wif"" results in two ""red"" colors, as per the sequence ""blue blue blue red red"".

Therefore, the rule we can deduce for ""walm"" is as follows:

Walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" three times.

Rule: When ""walm"" is used after a word, it causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" across all provided examples.
In each example, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" It does not seem to change its meaning based on its position or the context within the sentence. The examples consistently show a one-to-one relationship between the input ""dax"" and the output ""green.""

Therefore, the rule is:

dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the inputs directly corresponds to ""red"" in the outputs. Therefore, we can establish the following rule:

Rule: wif -> ""red""
zup -> meaning. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> red
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" let's analyze the examples given:

1. zup wif dax walm -> yellow red green green green
2. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
3. zup bluf lug zup walm -> yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. dax walm wif dax -> green green green red green

We can notice that the output color sequences have a varying number of colors compared to the input words. This variation seems to correlate with the presence of the word ""walm.""

Example analysis:

- In example 1, the sequence ends with triple ""green,"" and the last word in the input is ""walm.""
- In example 2, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" resulting in ""red red red.""
- In example 3, the sequence ends with double ""yellow,"" which corresponds to ""walm"" being the last word.
- In example 4, we see ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" and then ""walm"" again, correlating with the colors ""yellow"" and ""red"" repeating, respectively.
- In example 5, no repeating sequence of colors appears after ""walm,"" but it comes after ""dax,"" which corresponds to a single ""green.""

From these observations, it seems like ""walm"" has a rule of repeating the last color listed before it. For the exact rule, we should also notice that the amount of repetition seems to be tied to the position of ""walm"".

In examples 1, 3, and 4, we see that when ""walm"" is at the end or followed by ""wif"" (which yields the color red), the previous color is repeated three times for ""walm"" at the end (green) and twice for ""walm"" followed by ""wif"" (yellow).

Contrarily, in example 5 where ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is not at the end of the sequence, nor followed by ""wif,"" ""walm"" results in just a single repetition of the preceding color (""green"" from ""dax"").

Therefore, we can infer that the rule for ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color associated with the preceding word to repeat. The number of repetitions depends on the position of ""walm"" and the following words:
- If ""walm"" is at the end or before ""wif,"" the previous color repeats three times.
- If ""walm"" follows ""dax"" without being the last word or followed by ""wif,"" it repeats the color once.

With the given examples, the rule is:
walm -> Causes the repetition of the previous color, amount varies by position and surrounding words.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Each instance where ""lug"" appears in the input, the term ""blue"" appears in the output at the same position.

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output. There doesn't appear to be context-dependent variation; ""dax"" always results in ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words. Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""wif"" correlates with the color ""red"" consistently. Each time ""wif"" is presented in the input, the output includes ""red"" at the corresponding position.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can induce the following patterns:

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow
- 'lug' leads to 'blue'
- 'walm' leads to 'blue'
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow'

Input: zup dax wif zup
Output: yellow green red yellow
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow' at both the first and last positions
- 'dax' leads to 'green'
- 'wif' leads to 'red'

Input: zup dax bluf
Output: yellow green green
- 'zup' leads to 'yellow'
- 'dax' leads to 'green'
- 'bluf' presumably leads to 'green'

Input: zup
Output: yellow
- 'zup' by itself also leads to 'yellow'

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow
- 'wif' leads to 'red'
- 'zup' again leads to 'yellow'

Based on these observations, the rule we can induce for the nonce word ""zup"" is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word has a corresponding color. Let's look at the consistent color that appears after each instance of the nonce word ""bluf.""

- In examples 1 and 4, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""dax,"" the output is ""yellow green.""
- In example 3, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow blue.""
- In example 5, when ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug dax,"" the output is ""yellow blue green.""

From these patterns, it seems that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" as every time ""bluf"" is mentioned, ""yellow"" is the color that follows in the output. The following word then corresponds to its own specific color as well (e.g., ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""). The word ""bluf"" does not appear to alter the color associated with the subsequent word.

Rule: bluf -> yellow.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the patterns:

1. ""dax zup dax walm"" results in ""green yellow green green green."" We know that ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Since ""walm"" is followed by only ""green,"" it seems to repeat the color of the word before it.

2. ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green."" This strengthens the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the word before it because ""dax"" is ""green,"" and after ""walm,"" there are two more ""green.""

3. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" results in ""green blue blue blue yellow red."" Here, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" is followed by two more ""blue,"" suggesting it continues the pattern of the previous word, which is ""lug"" (blue). ""zup"" changes the sequence to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red.""

4. ""dax walm wif dax"" results in ""green green green red green."" ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green) and results in two more ""green."" However, ""wif"" does not follow the pattern by not matching the color before it, which is ""green,"" instead changing it to ""red.""

5. ""dax zup walm wif"" results in ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and we see a series of ""yellow"" after ""walm"" again, with ""wif"" changing the sequence to ""red.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the color of the word before it. Whenever ""walm"" is used, it results in an output that extends the color of the previous word.

Rule: walm -> repeats the color of the word before it in the output sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: Based on the examples given, wherever 'lug' appears in the input, 'blue' appears in the corresponding location in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""dax"" corresponds with the color green in the output. When ""dax"" appears, no matter the preceding or following words, the output consistently includes the color green.

Here is the correspondence:

- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green"" (with ""yellow"" likely tied to ""zup"").
- ""dax bluf"" corresponds to ""green green"" (with the second ""green"" likely tied to ""bluf"").
- The repeat of ""zup dax"" gives the same ""yellow green"" output, reinforcing that ""zup"" maps to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" maps to ""green.""
- ""zup lug dax"" corresponds to ""yellow blue green"" (with ""yellow"" tied to ""zup"", ""blue"" likely tied to ""lug"", and ""green"" to ""dax"").
- ""dax wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green red red"" (with ""green"" tied to ""dax"" and ""red"" likely tied to both ""wif"" and ""bluf"", suggesting that ""bluf"" has a dual meaning depending on context).

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the other words present or their corresponding colors.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"".
Rule: bluf -> the color word preceding it.
To figure out what ""walm"" means, let's analyze the patterns before and after ""walm"" in each example:

Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
Pattern before ""walm"": red yellow
Pattern after ""walm"": yellow green yellow

Input: zup dax walm

Pattern after ""walm"": blue

Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
Output: red red green green red red red blue red
Pattern before ""walm"": red red green green red red red
Pattern after ""walm"": blue red

Observing the patterns, we can infer that the word ""walm"" causes the color immediately preceding it to repeat three times in the output.

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" is:
walm -> Repeat the color that immediately precedes ""walm"" three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color word immediately before it to be repeated three times in the output sequence.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
From the given examples, we can infer the association of colors to words as follows:

- ""zup"" yields ""yellow""
- ""wif"" yields ""red""
- ""walm"" yields ""red""
- ""lug"" yields ""yellow""

With this in mind, we can analyze the occurrences of ""dax"" and the output color sequences:

1. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   Analysis: Since ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" in this context would map to ""green.""

2. Input: zup walm lug zup wif dax
   Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green
   Analysis: ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" ""walm"" and ""lug"" both map to ""yellow,"" and ""wif"" maps to ""red."" There's an unknown mapping leading to ""blue"". As per rest of the sequence, ""dax"" again maps to ""green.""

3. Input: zup dax
   Output: yellow green
   Analysis: This is a repetition of the first example, reinforcing that ""dax"" represents ""green"" when following ""zup.""

4. Input: dax wif zup dax
   Output: green red yellow green
   Analysis: In this example, ""dax"" is before ""wif"" and results in ""green,"" ""wif"" then gives ""red,"" ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" and the final ""dax"" again results in ""green."" This suggests that ""dax"" consistently maps to ""green"" regardless of its position.

5. Input: dax wif walm
   Output: green red red red
   Analysis: ""dax"" at the beginning leads to ""green,"" and both ""wif"" and ""walm"" map to ""red.""

Based on these observations, we can conclude that ""dax"" is consistently mapped to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position or the other words present.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the meaning of the nonce word ""wif"" can be deduced as follows:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is ""red.""
- When ""wif"" appears in a sequence with other nonce words, it adds the word ""red"" to the output sequence.

Therefore, ""wif"" translates to ""red"" in this context. Every occurrence of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to an occurrence of ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, zup consistently results in the output ""yellow."" Each time zup is present in the input, the color yellow is present in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, we can induce the rule that zup corresponds to the color yellow.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> yellow

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we must look for patterns in the given examples. The color outputs after the ""walm"" word can give us the rule for what ""walm"" means.

Observing the examples:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. lug dax walm -> blue green green green
3. wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
4. zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
5. dax walm -> green green green

In each output, the word ""walm"" is directly followed by a sequence of ""green"" colors in the output. The rest of the words in the input do not consistently result in the color ""green"" in the output elsewhere, so they're not directly associated with the color green. The number of ""green"" outputs after ""walm"" also seems to vary, but it is never just one. Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" directly translates to a sequence of green outputs.

However, to deduce the rule accurately, we need to understand how the number of green outputs is determined. From the examples, we can deduce that the sequence of ""green"" is either equal to or exactly one more than the number of words in the input sequence following ""walm"":

1. wif walm dax zup -> two words follow walm -> three greens follow in output.
2. lug dax walm -> zero words follow walm -> one green follows in output.
3. wif bluf dax walm -> zero words follow walm -> one green follows in output.
4. zup lug walm wif dax -> two words follow walm -> three greens follow in output.
5. dax walm -> zero words follow walm -> one green follows in output.

The interpretation that walm is followed by a number of greens equal to the number of words that follow it, plus one, seems consistent across the examples.

So the rule appears to be:
Rule: ""walm"" -> The number of ""green"" outputs after ""walm"" is equal to the number of words that follow ""walm"" in the input plus one.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Input: wif lug wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red blue red yellow yellow,red blue red yellow yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
From the provided examples, we can attempt to infer the rule that defines the meaning of the non-word ""lug"" by examining the pattern of outputs it corresponds to.

In the first input-output pair, ""lug walm dax"" is translated to ""blue blue blue green,"" indicating that ""lug"" in this instance corresponds to ""blue.""

In the second input-output pair, ""wif lug"" corresponds to ""red blue,"" which again supports the notion that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

The third input-output sequence includes multiple instances of ""walm"" and ""dax,"" also including ""wif lug."" Given that ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green"" and ""wif"" to ""red,"" we again see that ""lug"" is followed by ""blue.""

The fourth example also supports this pattern, where ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue,"" consistently aligning ""lug"" with ""blue.""

Finally, the fifth input-output example further reinforces our rule, as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" when all other word-color correspondences (""zup"" with ""yellow,"" ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""bluf"" with ""red,"" and ""wif"" with ""red"") are taken into account.

Thus, we can infer the following rule:

Rule: lug translates to blue or represents the color blue.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Regardless of where ""dax"" appears in the sequence or how often it is repeated, the output is always ""green"" for each occurrence of ""dax"". There is no context given that would suggest the meaning of ""dax"" is dependent on other factors or changes with context.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the input and output examples provided, the pattern that emerges is as follows:

1. When the word ""wif"" is present, it consistently translates to the color ""red.""
2. ""wif"" does not appear to influence or change depending on its position in the sequence.

So, from the given information, the induction of the rule for the word 'wif' can be summarized as:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word `zup` appears to consistently translate to the color `yellow`. Each occurrence of `zup` in the input corresponds to `yellow` in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a specific color, and the same nonce word always results in the same color in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

- In the first example, ""wif"" appears three times and ""bluf"" once. The output is ""yellow red green red red."" Since ""wif"" appears directly before two reds in the other examples, we can deduce that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""bluf"" is surrounded by ""wif"" twice in the first example, and the sequence yields ""green red red."" Since we deduced ""wif"" is ""red,"" the color that appears once and is in between reds must correspond to ""bluf,"" which is ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" appears twice, and in both instances, it is followed by ""wif"" (resulting in ""yellow""). Since ""wif"" is red, the new color preceding it, which is ""yellow,"" must correspond to ""bluf.""

Therefore, based on the given examples, the rule can be written as:

bluf -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" creates repetitions of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. More specifically, it seems to create two additional repetitions of the previous color. Here's how the rule applies to the examples:

1. In the example ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""lug"" with blue. Following the last word ""lug,"" ""walm"" generates two additional ""blue"" outputs, resulting in ""green blue green blue blue blue.""

2. In the example ""dax walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green, and ""walm"" causes two additional repetitions of green, resulting in ""green green green.""

3. In the example ""dax wif walm,"" the word ""dax"" is associated with green and ""wif"" with red. After ""wif,"" ""walm"" generates two additional ""red"" outputs, resulting in ""green red red red.""

4. In the example ""lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" causes two additional repetitions of blue, resulting in ""blue blue blue.""

5. In the example ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green and ""lug"" with blue. After ""lug,"" ""walm"" generates two additional ""blue"" outputs, resulting in ""green blue blue blue.""

Therefore, the rule induced regarding the term ""walm"" is as follows:

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color word (e.g., ""dax"" for green, ""lug"" for blue, ""wif"" for red), it results in two additional repetitions of the last mentioned color.
 
Hence: walm -> Causes two additional repetitions of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" in each provided example.
Rule: bluf -> yellow

Each instance of the word bluf is translated to the word ""yellow"" in the output.
walm -> meaning. The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color preceding it.

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another color word, the color that word represents is repeated a certain number of times. In all given examples, ""walm"" caused the previous color word to be outputted three additional times (for a total of four sequential mentions of the color).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Lug consistently corresponds to the color blue in the given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
Based on the examples provided, each output color seems to correspond to the input word in its position. With this observation, we can deduce:

- Whenever dax appears, the output is green.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""walm"" and ""dax"" provide an output of green green green, which means ""walm"" also corresponds to green.
- ""zup"" and ""bluf"" correspond to yellow, since the output for ""zup bluf dax"" is yellow yellow green.
- ""wif"" corresponds to red.

Therefore, the rule appears to be that each word is directly mapped to a color, and dax consistently maps to green regardless of its position in the sequence.

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the output is ""red"". The presence of other words in the input seems to correspond to other colors, but regardless of their position or combination, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" echoes each preceding word by converting it into a corresponding color. The pattern is as follows:

- `wif` corresponds to ""red"".
- `lug` corresponds to ""blue"".
- `zup` corresponds to ""yellow"".
- `dax` corresponds to ""green"".
- `walm` corresponds to ""blue"" (repeated from `lug`).

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is to repeat the color names corresponding to the words immediately preceding it.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the output color for each preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times.

Rule:
When ""walm"" appears after a color-indicating word (e.g., ""zup"" for yellow, ""lug"" for blue, ""dax"" for green), it implies that the color word preceding ""walm"" should be repeated in the output more than once, specifically three times. ""Walm"" itself does not correspond to a color but rather to the action of repeating.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every example provided.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" is mentioned in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:
dax -> green
Analyzing the given examples:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Rule: The output is singular and correlates with the singular input 'wif.'

2. Input: dax lug wif lug
   Output: green blue red blue
   Rule: The word immediately after 'wif' is not repeated, but the color sequence remains symmetrical around 'wif.'

3. Input: wif zup walm dax zup
   Output: red yellow yellow yellow green yellow
   Rule: 'wif' is followed by a different color output 'yellow,' even though 'zup' appears twice after 'wif,' suggesting that 'wif' could change the subsequent word's output the first time it is used.

4. Input: wif dax bluf
   Output: red green green
   Rule: The 'dax' next to 'wif' does not change color, but 'bluf' becomes green instead of presuming a different color, which might suggest 'bluf' has a default color or is influenced by proximity to 'wif.'

5. Input: wif walm dax
   Output: red red red green
   Rule: 'wif' leads to 'red,' and 'walm' also outputs 'red,' only 'dax' changes the pattern but it's still influenced by the preceding 'wif' to be 'red' before reverting to 'green.'

Based on the above deductions, a possible rule for 'wif' is that it outputs 'red,' but it may also influence the next word to produce the same output (red) before reverting to its original output or a subsequent default (potentially green in the case of 'dax').

Rule: wif -> 'red' (with potential influence on the next word's output)
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each unique word is associated with a specific color. We can see that ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""bluf"" to ""yellow,"" when repeated in the last example. 

However, the word ""zup"" seems to be consistently associated with the color ""yellow"" in every example given. As such, the meaning of ""zup"" in these examples can be deduced to translate to the color ""yellow"" as well.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Analyzing the input and output pairs, it becomes clear that each word translates to a color. The results for ""zup"" consistently map to yellow, ""dax"" to green, ""wif"" to red, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" also to yellow. 

For the word ""bluf,"" each occurrence in the output is followed by the word ""red."" Unlike the other words, which translate to a single color, ""bluf"" adds a repetition of the color that the word immediately preceding it translates to. Here are the instances:

- In ""zup bluf"", ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", and ""bluf"" results in another ""yellow"".
- In ""wif bluf dax bluf"", ""wif"" and ""dax"" translate to ""red"" and ""green"", respectively, and each ""bluf"" results in the repetition of these colors.
- In ""wif bluf"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""bluf"" again makes it ""red red"".

Thus the rule seems to be:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the word before it.
walm -> meaning. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the preceding color word to be repeated three times. For example, ""lug wif walm"" translates to ""blue red red red"", ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green"", and ""zup walm"" produces ""yellow yellow yellow"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

    ",Output: red blue yellow yellow red red,red blue yellow yellow red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
Rule:
dax -> green

Based on the examples, every time the word ""dax"" is mentioned, the output consistently includes the color ""green"" after its occurrence. Thus, it appears that the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" is associated with the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, ""red"" is included in the output.

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow."" When ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output color is ""yellow.""

Rule: When the input contains the word ""zup,"" the output color associated with this word is yellow.
Rule: The term ""bluf"" repeats the color word that appears immediately before it. 

Thus:

bluf -> meaning

Meaning: Repeat the color word that precedes ""bluf"".

So, when ""bluf"" follows a color word, it takes on the meaning of that color word and repeats it.
To determine the meaning of ""walm,"" we can look at the association between the inputs and the outputs.

In the first example, ""walm"" corresponds to four ""yellow"" outputs.
In the second example, ""walm"" corresponds to three red outputs.
In the third example, ""walm"" corresponds to a sequence of two ""blue"" outputs.
In the fourth example, ""walm"" corresponds to two ""yellow"" outputs.
In the fifth example, ""walm"" corresponds to two ""green"" outputs.

Given the consistency in the outputs following ""walm,"" it suggests that ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the immediately preceding color in the output, with the number of repetitions depending on the other elements that follow ""walm"" (if any). This number might be influenced by the number of terms that follow ""walm."" However, without further examples, it is difficult to assert the number of repetitions precisely as a clear pattern is not evident.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" in the output sequence. The number of repetitions seems to vary, potentially depending on the context or subsequent elements, which cannot be determined conclusively based on the provided examples.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in the output. Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, it translates to ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is included in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence. Other words in the input correspond to other colors; for example, ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red."" 

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule:

For every occurrence of the word ""zup"" in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""

Every time ""zup"" appears, regardless of its position in the sentence or the words around it, it consistently translates to ""yellow"" in the output. Therefore:

zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf,"" we can analyze the pattern of inputs and outputs to identify the corresponding color for ""bluf."" By comparing all given examples, we can infer that:

- In the first example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second occurrence of ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second occurrence of ""blue.""
- In the third and fourth examples, ""bluf"" correlates with a second occurrence of ""blue"" and ""green"" respectively.
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" correlates with the second occurrence of ""red.""

From these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" means a repetition or second occurrence of the color that comes directly before it in the sequence. Seeing that it consistently represents the color of the word before it, we can deduce the general rule for the nonce word.

Rule: bluf -> the same color as the word immediately before it.
walm -> meaning. Meaning: the word walm is likely a command that means repeating the color of the word immediately before it three times.

Rule: Whenever walm is used after a word that represents a color, it should be translated into three instances of that color. For example, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" where ""lug"" is blue, and walm indicates that blue should be repeated two more times, making three in total.

Rule: dax -> green

Meaning: The appearance of the nonce word ""dax"" in the input correlates with the color ""green"" in the output.
Rule: wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we need to find a consistent pattern in the relationship between the input and output across the examples provided.

Examining the outputs corresponding to ""zup"" in each example:

- Example 1: ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- Example 2: ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- Example 3: ""zup"" results in ""yellow""
- Example 4: A single ""zup"" results in ""yellow,"" while a double ""zup"" (after ""lug"") results in ""yellow yellow.""
- Example 5: Both occurrences of ""zup"" result in ""yellow,"" whether it is preceded by other words or not.

From these examples, it seems that ""zup"" consistently maps to the output ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. None of the inputs suggest that ""zup"" has a conditional meaning or that it affects or is affected by adjacent words.

Rule: zup -> yellow. ""Zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the word ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. Below is the interpretation of the examples with this rule applied:

1. ""wif lug bluf"" translates to ""red blue blue"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug""
2. ""dax lug bluf"" translates to ""green blue blue"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug""
3. ""wif bluf"" translates to ""red red"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif""
4. ""lug wif bluf lug wif"" translates to ""blue red red blue red"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""wif""; the sequence is then followed by ""lug wif"", repeating their respective colors
5. ""lug walm wif lug bluf"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue blue"" — ""bluf"" repeats the color associated with ""lug""

Rule:
bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word. If the preceding word is ""wif,"" the color is red. If the preceding word is ""lug,"" the color is blue. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" the color is assumed to be the same as the color definition for ""dax"" (green in the given example).
walm -> meaning

Based on the examples provided, each time the nonce word ""walm"" appears in the input, the output is a sequence of the word ""green"" repeated three times. Regardless of the other words present in the input or their sequence, ""walm"" consistently translates to ""green green green"" in the output.

dax -> meaning. Meaning is the color ""green.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each nonce word corresponds to a color. The word ""wif"" consistently leads to the output ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. Therefore, we can determine the meaning of ""wif"" as follows:

Rule: wif -> red

Meaning: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red.
zup -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule: zup translates to ""yellow.""
Rule: `bluf` means repeating the color word that corresponds to the last word before `bluf`. 

Each word seems to associate with a specific color: 
- `wif` corresponds with the color red.
- `lug` corresponds with the color blue.
- `dax` corresponds with the color green.
- `zup` corresponds with the color yellow.

The word `bluf` triggers the repetition of the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. 

For example:
- ""wif bluf"" leads to ""red red"" because `wif` corresponds to ""red"" and is followed by `bluf`, which duplicates the color associated with the previous word.
- ""lug dax bluf"" results in ""blue green green"" because `dax` represents green, and `bluf` causes it to repeat.
- ""zup bluf"" gives us ""yellow yellow"" following the same rule.
- ""wif dax bluf"" outputs ""red green green"" - here, `dax` corresponds to ""green"" which is then doubled due to `bluf`.
- ""dax zup lug bluf"" turns into ""green yellow blue blue"" where `lug` stands for ""blue"", and `bluf` dictates that it's duplicated.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the preceding word.
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" appears to mean repeating the color associated with the word preceding it three times.

walm -> repeat the associated color of the preceding word three times.

zup -> meaning. Rule: ""zup"" takes the color of the word that comes after it. If ""zup"" is followed by ""bluf,"" the color is yellow. If ""zup"" is followed by ""lug,"" the color is blue. If ""zup"" is followed by ""dax,"" the color is green. If ""zup"" appears at the end of a sequence or without a following color-associated word, we default to the rule as if it is followed by ""bluf"", resulting in the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the correspondence between the inputs and outputs closely:

- Whenever ""walm"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output.
- The presence of ""walm"" does not change the color associated with the other words (""wif"" always corresponds to ""red,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"").
- The position of ""walm"" in the sequence does not appear to affect its output or the outputs of other words.

From these observations, we can deduce that ""walm"" consistently maps to ""red,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> red. ""Walm"" corresponds to the color ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in English regardless of its position or context within the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, each unique word seems to correspond to a specific color. The constant across all examples is the word ""wif"" and it consistently translates to the color ""red"". There are multiple occurrences of ""wif"" and each time it appears, the output color is the same.

Therefore, the rule seems to be that:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the output of two colors; the first is red and the second repeats the color of the word that immediately precedes it. If there is no preceding word, the second color is omitted.

Thus, bluf means -> Repeat preceding color and add red. If no preceding color, just add red.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the color associated with the prior word, with the number of repetitions being three. Each unique word before ""walm"" (other than ""walm"" itself) corresponds to a color:

- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue
- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""dax"" has been observed twice, corresponding to green both times

When ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is that word's corresponding color repeated three times. In the case where multiple words precede ""walm"", each word's corresponding color is repeated once in order, followed by the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm"" repeated twice more.

Rule: walm -> the preceding word's corresponding color is repeated three times; in a sequence, each unique color word is expressed once, followed by the immediate precursor to ""walm"" repeated twice more for a total of three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, the rule seems to be:

When ""dax"" appears in the input, it translates to ""green"" in the output.

Therefore, the meaning can be stated as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of ""dax"" in the input is replaced with ""green"" in the output.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following:

- When ""wif"" appears alone, the output is red (Example 4).
- When ""wif"" appears before any other word, the first element in the output is red (Examples 1, 2, 3, 5).

Based on this information, it seems that ""wif"" might trigger the color red in the output sequence, regardless of the surrounding words. It could indicate the color red directly or it could be a modifier that ensures red is included in the output sequence as the color associated with it or the position following it.

Hence, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""wif"" is used in the input, it corresponds to the color red in the output sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output. The surrounding words don't seem to alter the meaning of ""zup."" Hence, the rule is that ""zup"" translates directly to ""yellow.""
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""bluf"" directly corresponds to the color that was used to describe the word immediately preceding it. Here’s the pattern:

1. dax bluf wif zup -> green green red yellow
    - dax is green, and bluf is also green (matching the color of dax).

2. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
    - lug is blue, and bluf is also blue (matching the color of lug).

3. lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug -> blue blue red blue red red red blue
    - lug is blue, bluf is blue again (matching the color of lug). wif is red, and each subsequent wif and walm is red, with lug returning to blue.

4. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
    - zup is yellow, and bluf is yellow (matching the color of zup).

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
    - As in the previous example, zup is yellow, and bluf matches it.

From these examples, we can derive the following:

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> the word directly preceding ""walm"" is translated into a color repeated three times, based on the following mappings:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

Given this rule, when ""walm"" appears after a particular word, that word is turned into its corresponding color and the color name is repeated thrice. This is made evident as each instance of ""walm"" follows a word that has a color association (lug => blue, dax => green, wif => red) and the color repeats three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" is consistently translated to the color ""blue"" in each example given.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green. Each instance of ""dax"" in the input sentences is translated to ""green"" in the output sentences. Hence, the rule can be stated as follows:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" is present in the output, regardless of the other words. The other words in the inputs correspond to their respective colors in the output (e.g., ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" to ""green"").

Rule:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf corresponds to the color blue. 

bluf -> blue.
Analyzing the examples provided, we can deduce the following rules for the color outputs associated with certain words:

- lug -> blue
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow
- dax -> green
- bluf -> red

Looking at the pattern where the word ""walm"" is included, it appears that the output is a repetition of the color that follows the word appearing just before ""walm."" Moreover, regardless of the color preceding ""walm,"" three greens always follow.

Now let's derive the rule for ""walm"" based on the examples:

1. lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   Here, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (which is blue). Therefore, ""walm"" results in three instances of blue.

2. lug zup dax walm
   Output: blue yellow green green green
   ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is green). Therefore, ""walm"" results in three instances of green.

3. wif dax zup walm
   Output: red green yellow yellow yellow
   ""Walm"" follows ""zup"" (which is yellow). Thus ""walm"" results in three instances of yellow.

4. wif lug dax walm
   Output: red blue green green green
   Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which is green), causing ""walm"" to output three instances of green.

5. wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   Once more, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), leading to a triple-green output.

Given these observations, we can conclude the following rule for the nonce word ""walm"":

Rule: walm -> The word ""walm"" results in three consecutive instances of the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. However, if ""dax"" (green) appears before ""walm,"" irrespective of this rule, the color green will be outputted three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the context in which it is used but generally leads to three instances of a color, as described by the rule above, with a specific exception for when it follows ""dax.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, lug consistently translates to ""blue."" There isn't an indication that its meaning changes based on position or context within the given sequence.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: In all provided examples, the nonce word dax consistently correlates with the color green in the output.
To deduce the meaning of the word ""wif"" from the given examples, let’s observe the pattern of input and output:

1. Input: dax walm wif zup
   Output: green green green red yellow
   Analysis: The colors corresponding to 'dax' and 'walm' are 'green'. 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow'. After 'wif', the color is 'red', which is new and does not correspond to the colors that came before it.

2. Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
   Output: blue green yellow green green green red
   Analysis: The colors corresponding to 'lug', 'dax', and 'zup' are 'blue', 'green', and 'yellow'. Once again, after 'wif', we see the color 'red'.

3. Input: dax wif
   Output: green red
   Analysis: Here, 'dax' corresponds to 'green', and after 'wif', there is 'red'.

4. Input: wif
   Output: red
   Analysis: With just 'wif' in the input, the output is 'red'.

5. Input: zup wif bluf zup lug
   Output: yellow red red yellow blue
   Analysis: 'Zup' corresponds to 'yellow', and 'lug' to 'blue'. The presence of 'wif' is followed by 'red', and 'bluf' produces another 'red'.

Based on these observations, it seems that 'wif' directly corresponds to the color 'red'. It does not matter what comes before or after 'wif'; it always results in the color 'red'.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repeat the color associated with the word preceding it.

Rule: When the nonce word ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color associated with that preceding word, repeated twice.
Based on the examples provided, the term ""walm"" seems to be a rule that repeats the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" four times. In each example, the word that comes before ""walm"" gets translated to its corresponding color, which is then repeated four times.

Here are the associations based on the input and output pairs:

- First example: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is outputted four times.
- Second example: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", and after ""walm"", ""blue"" is outputted four times.
- Third example: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is outputted four times.
- Fourth example: the color before ""walm"" is ""zup"", which translates to ""yellow"", and is outputted four times after ""walm"".
- Fifth example: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and after ""walm"", ""green"" is outputted three times followed by ""red"", which is the translation of ""wif"".

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:
Rule: Repeat the color associated with the word immediately before ""walm"" four times in the output. If there is another word following ""walm,"" its corresponding color (if applicable) will come after the repetition.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: Every time the word 'wif' appears in the input, the output is 'red'.
Based on the inputs and corresponding outputs provided, we can infer the following associations:

- ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue""
- ""walm"" corresponds to the output ""red red red"" or ""red"" repeated three times
- ""wif"" corresponds to the output ""red""
- ""bluf"" is not present in the examples, but ""zup wif bluf"" results in ""yellow red red,"" which may suggest that ""bluf"" could correspond to an additional ""red,"" but there's not enough data to confirm this.
- ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green""

Given these associations, we can propose the following rules for the nonce word ""zup"":

1. ""zup"" by itself corresponds to the output ""yellow.""
2. When following ""zup,"" each subsequent word corresponds to a color or a series of colors.
3. ""walm"" specifically seems to amplify the output color associated with it by tripling the output (""red red red"").

Thus, based on the examples, the rule for ""zup"" seems to be: ""zup"" initiates a sequence where it is always followed by ""yellow,"" and each subsequent nonce word is mapped to specific color outputs, with ""walm"" repeating its color thrice.

Rule: 
zup -> ""yellow"" followed by the sequence of colors corresponding to each nonce word that comes after ""zup"" in the input, with certain words possibly repeating their associated color.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's look at the consistent patterns for that word across different inputs and outputs.

In the first input, ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""red red."" This suggests that ""bluf"" might translate to ""red,"" but there's a repetition of the color red in the output that is not present in the input.

In the second input, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue blue red,"" and in this case, the word ""bluf"" is repeated once—this matches the pattern of repeating the color.

In the third input, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue,"" but here, it is followed by another ""blue."" This could imply that ""bluf"" means ""blue"" with a repeat of the color output immediately following.

In the fourth and fifth inputs, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow red"" and ""blue red,"" respectively. Like previous observations, the ""bluf"" is associated with a color followed by ""red.""

Across all these examples, the common factor is that whenever ""bluf"" appears, the color corresponding to the preceding word is repeated followed by ""red.""

Therefore, the rule can be established that ""bluf"" indicates a repetition of the preceding mentioned color followed by the color red.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the previous color and follow it with red.
walm -> meaning. 

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding color word to repeat the number of times equal to the number of letters in that color word. For example:

- In ""wif walm zup lug wif walm zup,"" ""wif"" has three letters, so ""red"" is repeated three times after ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm zup wif,"" ""lug"" has three letters, resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times post ""walm.""
- In ""lug walm dax,"" ""lug"" again leads to ""blue"" being repeated three times.
- In ""zup bluf wif walm,"" ""wif"" at the end results in ""red"" being repeated three times.
- ""dax walm"" shows that ""dax"" results in ""green"" being repeated three times.

Therefore, the meaning of ""walm"" depends on the preceding color word and involves replicating the corresponding color name as many times as there are letters in the preceding color word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The nonce word lug translates to the color blue.

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each output. Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
zup -> yellow

Rule: In each example provided, the word 'zup' consistently correlates with the output 'yellow.'
bluf -> repeat the color of the preceding word.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows another word, the output is the color that corresponds to the previous word, repeated twice.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be a rule that indicates that the output color should repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""walm."" In other words, ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color related to the word just before it.

For a clearer rule induction:

1. dax lug walm zup wif -> green blue blue blue yellow red
   ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and after ""walm"" we see blue repeated.

2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
   ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and after ""walm"" we see yellow repeated twice.

3. wif walm -> red red red
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" we see red repeated twice.

4. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
   ""dax"" corresponds to green, and after ""walm"" we see green repeated twice.

5. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
   ""wif"" corresponds to red, and after ""walm"" we see red repeated twice.

So, the rule for ""walm"" is:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in the input, the color corresponding to the word immediately before ""walm"" is repeated for the number of times ""walm"" appears consecutively in the input after that word.

Rule: bluf -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word preceding it. Here's how we can deduce the meaning:

1. In the first example, ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red."" We see that ""zup"" stands for yellow and ""wif"" stands for red. The three repetitions of red suggest that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

2. In the second example, ""wif walm dax"" gives us ""red red red green."" ""Wif"" is consistent with red, and ""dax"" with green. Again, ""walm"" repeats the color of the word right before it (red in this case) before moving on to the color associated with ""dax.""

3. In the third example, ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" Here ""dax"" is consistently green and ""lug"" is blue. With ""walm"" following ""lug,"" we get three repetitions of the color blue.

4. In the fourth example, ""zup walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" implying that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""zup,"" which is yellow.

5. Finally, in the fifth example, ""dax walm"" converts to ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" repeats the color of ""dax,"" which is green.

By analyzing these patterns, we can construct the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" -> The rule for ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word that comes directly before it three times.

Based on the given examples, the rule seems to indicate that the word ""dax"" results in the output of ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. When ""dax"" is present with other words, the outputs corresponding to those words are also provided in the same sequence, but ""dax"" consistently corresponds to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""wif"" seems to consistently correspond to the output ""red"". It appears that each other word is assigned a unique color, with ""lug"" corresponding to ""blue"", ""bluf"" consistently leading to a ""red"" output (thus might be equivalent to ""wif""), ""walm"" corresponding to ""blue"", and ""zup"" corresponding to ""yellow"".

Here is the rule induction based on the given examples:

""lug"" -> blue
""walm"" -> blue (although it causes duplications in the output, which seems to be a rule in itself)
""bluf"" -> red (just like ""wif"")
""zup"" -> yellow
""wif"" -> red

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can find a pattern that associates the nonce word ""bluf"" with a color in the output. 

Let's analyze each example to derive the rule for ""bluf"":

1. dax wif dax zup bluf -> green red green yellow yellow
- ""dax"" correlates to ""green""
- ""wif"" correlates to ""red""
- ""zup"" correlates to ""yellow""

Since ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and results in the same color ""yellow"", we might infer that ""bluf"" also correlates to ""yellow.""

2. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- Here again, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow"" which is the same color associated with ""zup.""

3. lug bluf zup lug -> blue blue yellow blue
- ""lug"" correlates to ""blue""
- It's immediately apparent that ""bluf"" correlates to ""blue"" here, following ""lug.""

4. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red
- Here, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and leads to ""red,"" the same color output as ""wif.""

5. zup bluf -> yellow yellow
- This example confirms the pattern seen in the earlier ""zup bluf"" example.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" seems to be that it outputs the same color as the word that precedes it. To put this into the requested format:

bluf -> meaning. Rule: The word ""bluf"" outputs the same color as the word immediately before it.

So, the rule is:

Rule: bluf takes the color of the word directly preceding it in the list.
To determine the meaning of ""walm"", let's first list down the word combinations and their outputs systematically:

1st input/output pair:
- lug walm zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow red

2nd input/output pair:
- zup bluf wif walm -> yellow yellow red red red

3rd input/output pair:
- zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow

4th input/output pair:
- dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green

5th input/output pair:
- wif walm lug bluf -> red red red blue blue

Rule Deduction Attempts:

1. walm always appears to yield the color blue, but it's not always in the same position:
   - In the 1st and 4th inputs, ""walm"" leads to two blue outputs.
   - In the 3rd input, ""walm"" is in the second position and leads to a yellow output matching its preceding word ""zup"".
   - In the 2nd and 5th inputs, ""walm"" is at the end or near the end and leads to multiple red outputs.

2. The position of ""walm"" in the input seems to affect the number of times blue appears in the output:
   - When ""walm"" is followed by another word (1st input), we get one less blue than the number of preceding words.
   - When ""walm"" is at the end (2nd and 5th inputs), it seems to replicate the color of the previous word multiple times.
   - When ""walm"" is in the second position, with one word before it and none after (3rd input), it replicates the color of the preceding word once.
   - When it's sandwiched between the same word (4th input), blue appears only twice amidst other colors.

Based on the observations above, one might be tempted to characterize ""walm"" as a word that causes duplication of the last color emitted, except when it follows ""lug"", in which case it emits blue, but this is contradicted in the 4th input where it is preceded by ""lug"" but doesn't emit blue twice.

""Walm"" might be better characterized as a modifier word that largely depends on context in terms of its position regarding other words and the colors they represent.

Given these observations, it is difficult to provide a single consistent rule that applies to all inputs and outputs for ""walm"". However, let's try to synthesize a unifying rule considering the variability we have observed:

Rule: walm -> meaning. When ""walm"" is immediately followed by another word, output blue for ""walm"" and carry on the pattern of preceding color(s) once (as seen in 1st input). When at the end or followed by ""dax"", ""walm"" seems to replicate the preceding color twice if preceded by ""wif"" or once if preceded by any other word (as seen in 2nd, 5th, and 4th inputs respectively). When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" with no following words, it outputs the color represented by ""zup"" (3rd input). Hence, the meaning of ""walm"" seems context-dependent and does not have a singular, consistent color representation.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Output: green green green red yellow

Every instance of 'dax' consistently corresponds to the output of 'green', regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words around it. This indicates that 'dax' is independent of context and has a one-to-one relationship with the output of 'green'. 

Therefore, the rule is:
dax -> green
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is used in the input, ""red"" appears in the output. It does not seem to vary with position or the words around it.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the word ""zup"" seems to consistently translate to the color ""yellow."" There is no indication that ""zup"" changes meaning depending on context or position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red

Based on the examples provided, whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""red"". Here is the interpretation based on the provided examples:

- ""dax bluf wif lug"" corresponds to ""green green red blue"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" corresponds to ""red red green green green"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""lug bluf zup"" corresponds to ""blue blue yellow"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif"" corresponds to ""red red green green red red red blue red"", and both instances of ""bluf"" correspond to ""red"".
- ""dax lug wif bluf"" corresponds to ""green blue red red"", and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red"".

Therefore, the word ""bluf"" can be deciphered to mean ""red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's analyze the input-output pairs:

1. 'dax lug walm' -> 'green blue blue blue'
2. 'zup dax lug walm zup lug' -> 'yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue'
3. 'zup walm' -> 'yellow yellow yellow'
4. 'wif lug walm' -> 'red blue blue blue'
5. 'dax wif walm lug zup walm' -> 'green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow'

By comparing the inputs with their respective outputs, we notice that 'walm' always results in a sequence of the color word that directly precedes it. Let's break it down further:

- In the first and fourth examples, 'lug walm' results in 'blue blue blue,' which suggests that the meaning of 'walm' relates to repeating the color of the word before it three times.
- The second example supports this, with 'lug walm' once again resulting in 'blue blue blue.' The word 'zup,' however, doesn't follow the same rule since 'zup lug' results in 'yellow blue' instead of repeating blue three times. This could mean that 'walm' only triggers repetition for the color immediately before it and that 'zup' has its own output of 'yellow.'
- In the third example, 'zup walm' results in 'yellow yellow yellow,' further suggesting that 'walm' repeats the color word prior to it three times.
- The fifth example complicates matters slightly by showing that 'dax wif walm' results in 'green red red red' and 'zup walm' in 'yellow yellow yellow.' Thus it appears that 'walm' is acting upon the color word immediately before it, without affecting the first color in the sequence.
  
From the given examples, the rule for 'walm' appears to be that it causes the color associated with the word immediately preceding it to be repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Given the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue."" Therefore, the meaning of ""lug"" in this context can be deduced as follows:

lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the output is ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the given examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output regardless of what precedes it in the input sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the rule as follows:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" refers to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: bluf -> red
Based on the examples provided, ""walm"" seems to directly dictate the color output in a repeating pattern specific to the first word. The color output related to ""walm"" is repeated for as many times as ""walm"" appears, with the exception that when followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is added to the pattern. Here's the pattern derived from the examples:

- ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green,"" indicating that ""walm"" after ""dax"" translates to repeating the color ""green"" three times.
- ""zup wif walm"" results in ""yellow red red red,"" indicating that when ""walm"" follows ""zup wif,"" it gives two repetitions of the color preceding ""wif"" and then adds ""red"" as many times as ""walm"" appears (in this case, ""walm"" only appears once).
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red,"" which supports the idea that ""wif"" after ""walm"" appends an extra ""red"" to the repeating pattern of the color related to the word preceding ""walm."" 
- ""zup walm dax lug"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow green blue."" ""Walm"" after ""zup"" produces a triple ""yellow,"" then the pattern follows the word ""dax"" with ""green,"" and then ""lug"" with ""blue"" according to their individual color associations.
- ""lug walm wif lug"" results in ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which again supports the previous observations, where ""walm"" after ""lug"" results in triple ""blue,"" and ""wif"" following ""walm"" adds a single ""red,"" while the final ""lug"" returns its associated color, ""blue.""

Thus, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" when following a word, causes the output to repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times. If it is directly followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is included after the set of three repeated colors.

Walm -> When following ""dax,"" ""zup,"" or ""lug,"" ""walm"" produces three instances of the color associated with those words (""green"" for ""dax,"" ""yellow"" for ""zup,"" and ""blue"" for ""lug""). If followed by ""wif,"" there is an addition of ""red"" to the color pattern.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: In the given examples, the word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of context.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in the outputs. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the given examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" stands for the color ""blue."" In each instance where the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the corresponding output features the word ""blue."" A rule that captures this pattern could be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> ""blue""
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" we need to look for patterns in the examples provided.

Input: zup wif walm lug
Output: yellow red red red blue

Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

Input: dax zup dax walm
Output: green yellow green green green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: lug walm zup
Output: blue blue blue yellow

Observing the patterns, every time the word ""walm"" appears in the input, the color that immediately follows it is repeated in the output. In the third input, ""walm"" is followed by no color (as it's the end of the input), and the repeating color is green, which is the color corresponding to the word before ""walm"" (""dax"").

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: ""walm"" causes the color corresponding to the next word to be repeated. If ""walm"" is the last word, the color corresponding to the previous word is repeated. If ""walm"" is followed by a color word, that color is repeated; if it is followed by a non-color word like ""zup,"" the corresponding color (""yellow"") is repeated.

So, walm -> causes the repetition of the color indicated by the next word in the sequence or the previous color if there is no next word.

If we apply this rule:

- In the first input, ""walm lug"" leads to ""red red red blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat.
- In the second input, ""zup walm"" at the end leads to ""yellow yellow yellow"" because ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, and there’s no word after ""walm,"" causing the repetition of the previous color, which is yellow.
- In the third input, there is no word after ""walm,"" so the color of the previous word ""dax"" (green) is repeated.
- In the fourth input, ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"" because ""wif"" corresponds to red, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat.
- In the fifth input, ""lug walm zup"" leads to ""blue blue blue yellow"" because ""lug"" corresponds to blue, and ""walm"" causes it to repeat before moving to the next word ""zup,"" which corresponds to yellow.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Observing that the word ""lug"" consistently results in ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input string or the surrounding words:

lug -> blue. 

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Considering the examples given and the corresponding outputs, we can induce a rule by looking at the position of ""dax"" in the input and its corresponding color in the output.

1. In the first input, ""dax"" is followed by ""zup walm wif"" and the output is ""green yellow yellow yellow red."" 

2. In the second input, ""dax"" is followed by ""lug walm"" and the output is ""green blue blue blue."" 

From these two examples, it seems that ""dax"" translates to ""green"" regardless of what follows it.

3. In the third input, ""dax"" appears after ""zup lug zup walm"" and the word that follows it is ""wif."" The corresponding output after the sequence that precedes ""dax"" is ""yellow blue yellow yellow yellow"" and then ""green"" follows in the same position as ""dax"" in the input sequence.

4. In the fourth input, ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" which implies that the word ""dax"" is represented by ""green"" again.

5. Finally, in the fifth input, ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" translates to ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue,"" where ""green"" corresponds to the position of ""dax"" once more.

From these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output color ""green"". Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: dax -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's examine the input and output pairs and identify any patterns:

1. Input: wif lug → Output: red blue
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".

2. Input: lug dax bluf wif dax → Output: blue green green red green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""bluf"" to ""green"", and ""wif dax"" to ""red green"". 
   - ""dax"" by itself corresponds to ""green"".

3. Input: zup dax lug wif dax → Output: yellow green blue red green
   - ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", ""dax"" to ""green"", and again ""wif dax"" leads to ""red green"".
   
4. Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm → Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
   - ""walm"" appears to correspond to ""red"", ""dax"" to ""green"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""lug"" to ""blue"".
   - The sequence ""wif walm"" maps to ""red red"" and ""wif lug"" maps to ""red blue"".

5. Input: zup bluf wif dax wif zup → Output: yellow yellow red green red yellow
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"", ""bluf"" to ""yellow"" (note discrepancy from example 2 which could indicate a mistake or change), ""wif dax"" to ""red green"" and ""wif zup"" to ""red yellow"".

It seems that ""wif"" translates always to ""red,"" but the color that follows depends on the word that immediately follows ""wif"".

Thus, the rule appears to be:
- ""wif"" precedes a color word, and the pair of ""wif"" + [next word] together generate ""red"" + [color corresponding to the next word].

Rule: wif -> ""red"" followed by the color corresponding to the next word after ""wif"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red when it is the last word in the sequence; otherwise, bluf -> blue.
Observing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" triggers a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. In other words, ""walm"" seems to be a command that means 'repeat the color associated with the preceding word.' Here's how it applies to each example:

- In the first example ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and following ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.
- In the second example ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and following ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- In the third example ""wif lug zup walm,"" after ""zup,"" which corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""
- In the fourth example ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and following ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- In the fifth example ""zup wif walm,"" after ""wif,"" which corresponds to ""red,"" ""red"" is repeated three times following ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:
Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, repeat the color associated with the word immediately before it three times.

Written succinctly:
walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax
    ",Output: red green,red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" correlates to the color ""blue."" Each time ""lug"" appears in the input, the color ""blue"" appears in the corresponding output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue.
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following color mappings for each unique word:

- zup -> yellow
- bluf -> yellow
- lug -> blue
- walm -> red red
- dax -> green
- wif -> red

By comparing the input with its corresponding output, we can see that regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the sequence, it consistently translates to the color ""red."" No other word in the examples provided results in the color red when used as a standalone word, thus we can conclude that:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the given examples, the word 'zup' consistently corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the breakdown:

1. wif dax bluf -> red green green
2. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. zup bluf dax lug bluf dax zup -> yellow yellow green blue blue green yellow
5. wif bluf -> red red

In each case, the color that ""bluf"" represents matches the color of the word before it. Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the preceding word.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we must analyze the input and the associated output together. Let's look at each instance where ""walm"" appears, the output that corresponds to it, and the context it's used in.

1. ""wif walm dax"" -> Output: red red red green
2. ""zup walm"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
3. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> Output: blue red green green green yellow
4. ""zup wif walm lug"" -> Output: yellow red red red blue
5. ""zup walm lug zup wif dax"" -> Output: yellow yellow yellow blue yellow red green

In each case, ""walm"" appears to correspond to an output color that was mentioned earlier in the sequence. Let's see if there's a pattern:

- In example 1, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red) and then ""walm"" outputs red as well.
- In example 2, ""zup"" precedes ""walm"" and outputs yellow. ""Walm"" also outputs yellow afterward.
- In example 3, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (which outputs green) and outputs green itself.
- In example 4, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" (which outputs red) and outputs red again.
- In example 5, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (which outputs yellow) and it outputs yellow as well; later ""walm"" is followed by ""lug"" (which outputs blue) and ""walm"" does not appear after it, so we cannot use this instance.

Based on these examples, it seems that ""walm"" replicates the color output of the word immediately preceding it. 

Rule: walm -> meaning. ""Walm"" means to replicate the color output of the word that immediately precedes it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue yellow blue,yellow blue yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color blue in every example provided.
dax -> green

Based on the provided examples, every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output always includes the word ""green."" This direct correspondence allows us to deduce the meaning of ""dax"" as ""green"" in this context. 

Rule: Whenever the input contains ""dax,"" the output must include ""green.""
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, ""red"" is part of the output sequence. Thus, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word `zup` corresponds to the color `yellow` each time it appears in the input.
Based on the given examples, we can attempt to analyze the relationship between the input nonce words and the output colors. Here is a breakdown of each example with analysis to identify the rule for ""bluf"":

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   
   When ""bluf"" appears between ""zup"" and ""lug,"" it outputs two yellows and three blues.

2. Input: zup dax bluf
   Output: yellow green green
   
   After ""zup"" and ""dax,"" ""bluf"" outputs two greens.

3. Input: zup wif bluf
   Output: yellow red red
   
   After ""zup"" and ""wif,"" ""bluf"" outputs two reds.

4. Input: lug walm wif lug bluf
   Output: blue blue blue red blue blue
   
   ""Bluf"" appears as the last word and generates two additional blues, which is the color associated with the word just before ""bluf"" (""lug"").

5. Input: lug wif bluf
   Output: blue red red
   
   Similarly, after ""lug"" and ""wif,"" ""bluf"" outputs two reds, which corresponds to the color associated with ""wif.""

From these examples, ""bluf"" seems to double the color output that corresponds to the word that directly precedes it. Thus, if the word before ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue,"" you get two ""blue."" If it's ""red,"" you get two ""red,"" and so on.

Rule: bluf -> duplicates the color associated with the word immediately before it
walm -> repeats the color word that precedes it three times.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, it repeats that color thrice. For instance, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"" because ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in these examples. Similarly, ""dax walm"" becomes ""green green green,"" indicating that ""dax"" is associated with the color green.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup walm lug

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each given example.
dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time ""dax"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the equivalent position in the output.
To determine the meaning of the word ""wif,"" we need to examine its occurrences across different input strings and the corresponding outputs:

1. ""dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax"" -> ""green blue blue blue green red red green""
   ""wif"" occurs before ""bluf"" which corresponds to ""red.""

2. ""zup dax lug wif dax"" -> ""yellow green blue red green""
   ""wif"" occurs before the second ""dax"" corresponding to ""red.""

3. ""zup wif lug zup walm"" -> ""yellow red blue yellow yellow yellow""
   ""wif"" precedes ""lug"" which corresponds to ""red.""

4. ""dax zup dax zup wif"" -> ""green yellow green yellow red""
   ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

5. ""dax walm wif"" -> ""green green green red""
   ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to ""red.""

In these examples, regardless of the words that precede ""wif,"" it always corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red when it follows wif and blue when it follows lug.
Rule: walm -> ""repeat the following color word three times""

In each example, the word ""walm"" is followed by a repetition of the color word that comes immediately after ""walm"" three times.

Example mapping:
- dax -> green -> walm dax -> green green green
- lug -> blue -> walm lug -> blue blue blue
- zup -> yellow (note: this is an assumption as ""zup"" is not defined in other examples where a color might be inferred, but it is preceding a single ""yellow"" in the output of the second example)
- wif -> red -> walm wif -> red red red

Thus, ""walm"" seems to indicate that the color word following it should be repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples, regardless of its position or surrounding context.
Rule:
dax -> green 

Every time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""green."" Therefore, ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates directly to the color ""red"" in all given examples. Each subsequent word corresponds to a specific color: lug translates to blue, zup translates to yellow, and bluf translates to red. When ""wif"" is followed by these words, it appears before the color represented by ""red,"" indicating that it itself corresponds to the color red.
zup -> yellow. 

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position in the sequence.
From the given examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents the color immediately preceding it. Here's the breakdown of how ""bluf"" works in the examples:

1. Input: lug wif lug bluf
   Output: blue red blue blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""lug,"" which represents blue, so ""bluf"" means blue here.

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red
   ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" which represents red, so ""bluf"" means red here.

3. Input: zup dax bluf zup dax
   Output: yellow green green yellow green
   ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which represents green, so ""bluf"" means green here.

4. Input: wif zup bluf wif dax
   Output: red yellow yellow red green
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which represents yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow here.

5. Input: wif zup bluf lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue
   ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" which represents yellow, so ""bluf"" means yellow here.

Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" is that it represents the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. bluf represents the same color as the word directly preceding it.
Observing the outputs associated with different inputs where ""walm"" is present, it seems that the color outputted right after ""walm"" is mentioned is not consistent as it depends on the word preceding it. However, it always outputs a sequence of the same color. Let's summarize the possible precedents to ""walm"" and the resulting color:

- ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red""
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow""
- ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
- ""dax walm"" results in ""green""

It seems that ""walm"" causes the output to repeat the color associated with the word right before it, with the following exceptions:

- No word before ""walm"" leads to a sequence of blue, as seen in ""lug walm.""
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" it does not repeat the output color and only outputs ""green"" once.

Consequently, we can deduce the following general rule for ""walm"":

Rule: ""walm"" causes the repetition of the color associated with the preceding word three times, with the exception when ""dax"" precedes it, which results in one ""green,"" or when ""walm"" is the first word, defaulting to a blue sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the input and output correspondence, it seems that ""lug"" is consistently translated to ""blue."" Therefore, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" is translated to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to ""green"" in the output.
wif -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. 
Rule: wif translates to the color red.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""zup"" can be inferred as follows:

- Each time ""zup"" appears alone, it translates to ""yellow.""
- When ""zup"" appears in a sequence with other words, it still translates to ""yellow.""

Therefore, we can deduce:

zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in a sequence.
Given the sequences of input and output, I must determine the rule that associates the nonce word ""bluf"" with a specific color or attribute. I will examine each example and compare them to find a pattern.

- In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green.""
- In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the third example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green.""
- In the fourth example, where ""bluf"" appears alone with ""dax,"" the output is ""green green,"" indicating that ""bluf"" and ""dax"" individually correspond to ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and corresponds to ""red.""

It looks like the word ""bluf"" primarily corresponds to the color ""green."" However, in the context where ""bluf"" follows ""wif,"" it corresponds to ""red."" This might suggest that ""wif"" influences or changes the color associated with ""bluf"".

Combining the information, the rule could be stated as:
1. When ""bluf"" appears in a sequence not preceded by the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color green.
2. When ""bluf"" appears in a sequence immediately following the word ""wif,"" it corresponds to the color red.

Therefore, the rule is:
Rule: ""bluf"" typically means green, unless it directly follows ""wif,"" in which case it means red.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine each occurrence and the corresponding output:

Input: dax walm zup lug
Output: green green green yellow blue
- The words ""dax,"" ""zup,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively. When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it corresponds to the color green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
- The words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""lug"" correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" and ""blue"" respectively. When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it corresponds to the color blue.

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow. ""Walm"" in this instance also corresponds to yellow.

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to green. ""Walm"" in this instance also corresponds to green.

Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
- The words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" ""lug,"" ""dax,"" and ""lug"" again correspond to ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""yellow,"" ""blue,"" ""green,"" and ""blue"" respectively. After ""lug,"" ""walm"" corresponds to blue, and after ""dax,"" ""walm"" corresponds to green.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" takes on the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Each example associates the word 'lug' with the color blue, as shown by the consistent output whenever lug appears in the input. No matter the position or other words around it, lug always results in the color blue in the output.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, as evidenced by its consistent output regardless of its position in the input string.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" consistently in every instance. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow, regardless of the context in which it is used.
bluf -> red
In reviewing the examples provided, each occurrence of the word ""walm"" seems to be associated with the repeated output of the color word that is directly before it. Here's the breakdown:

Input: zup walm wif -> Output: yellow yellow yellow red
""zup"" correlates with ""yellow"", and ""walm"" seems to result in the repetition of ""yellow"" three times before moving to the next word, which correlates with a new color.

Input: dax walm wif bluf -> Output: green green green red red
""dax"" correlates with ""green"", and again ""walm"" leads to the repetition of ""green"" three times before proceeding to the next words, each corresponding with a new color.

Input: zup walm dax -> Output: yellow yellow yellow green
Here, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" followed by three ""yellow"", and ""dax"" follows with ""green"" without repetition, as ""walm"" is not following it.

Input: zup walm -> Output: yellow yellow yellow
Again, ""zup"" corresponds with ""yellow"" and ""walm"" results in three ""yellow"".

Input: zup wif dax walm -> Output: yellow red green green green
""zup"" results in ""yellow"", ""wif"" results in ""red"", and ""dax"" results in ""green"". As ""walm"" comes after ""dax"", it causes ""green"" to be repeated three times.

Based on these observations, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the color corresponding to the directly previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup lug
    ",Output: yellow blue,yellow blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> ""green""

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates directly to the color ""green"" in each example given. The output position of ""green"" correlates directly with the position of ""dax"" in the input, indicating that ""dax"" consistently means green regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: wif -> red

Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""wif"" is translated to the color ""red"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we must look at the patterns and how they map to the outputs provided:

Input: zup
Output: yellow

Here, ""zup"" corresponds directly to ""yellow.""

Input: zup bluf
Output: yellow yellow

Here, ""zup"" still corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" seems to also correspond to ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif zup
Output: yellow red yellow

In this example, ""wif"" appears to correspond to ""red,"" given its position between two instances of ""zup,"" which we've already established corresponds to ""yellow.""

Input: lug bluf wif lug bluf zup
Output: blue blue red blue blue yellow

Analyzing this example, ""lug bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" implying ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue."" The ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" again, and ""zup"" to ""yellow"" at the end of the sequence.

Input: zup bluf wif bluf
Output: yellow yellow red red

Here, ""zup"" is confirmed once again to correspond to ""yellow,"" and ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" based on the previous example. ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and it's followed by another ""bluf"" that produces ""red"" in this context.

However, the last output indicates a deviation from the previous pattern where ""bluf"" corresponded to ""yellow"" but in this context corresponds to ""red."" It seems that ""wif"" has an effect on the subsequent word, changing its output from its stand-alone meaning.

Based on these observations, the rule for ""zup"" seems consistent, but to determine the exact rule for ""wif"" and ""bluf"" and how they interact, we would need more examples or information. For this task, we'll focus only on ""zup.""

Rule:
zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, let's try to deduce the meaning or the rule for the nonce word ""bluf.""

1. In the first example, we have: 

   - Input: wif bluf
   - Output: red red

Here, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" There is no other context provided, but ""bluf"" also produces ""red.""

2. In the second example:

   - Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   - Output: green green red blue yellow

Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" The word ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green,"" which is the same output as for ""dax.""

3. In the third example:

   - Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   - Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

Once again, ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" retain their correspondences. However, now ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" which is the same as the color given for ""zup"" immediately preceding it.

4. In the fourth example:

   - Input: dax bluf wif zup lug
   - Output: green green red yellow blue

Here, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""green,"" which is the same as the output for ""dax,"" the word preceding it.

5. In the fifth example:

   - Input: lug zup bluf dax
   - Output: blue yellow yellow green

In this example, ""bluf"" yields ""yellow,"" which also matches the output for ""zup"" preceding it.

From these examples, the pattern seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the same output as the color corresponding to the word immediately before it in the sequence. If it appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red""; if after ""dax,"" it's ""green""; if after ""lug,"" it's ""blue""; and if after ""zup,"" it's ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the same color as the word immediately preceding it.

Therefore:
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is the color output corresponding to the word immediately before ""bluf"" in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" I will analyze the common patterns before, within, and after the occurrences of ""walm"" in the examples:

1. In every instance, ""walm"" is directly followed by a sequence of the color red. 
2. It's not clear from the examples if ""walm"" has a direct color association, as it does not consistently translate to the same color. 

Considering this analysis, observe the following pattern:
- When the word ""walm"" appears, it is followed by multiple instances of the color red, specifically, one instance less than the total sequence of colors following ""walm."" For example:
  
  lug walm dax wif -> blue blue (blue) red red 
  (Inside the parentheses is where ""walm"" occurred, and it was not followed by a blue as in the pattern of ""lug"")

- ""walm"" could be indicating that every word following it will be translated as ""red,"" with the exception of the first color after ""walm.""

Therefore, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be:

Rule: When ""walm"" appears in an input sequence, each following word translates to the color red, except for the first word that follows ""walm,"" which is translated to a color based on its own translation rule (not given in these examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug wif lug
    ",Output: green blue red blue,green blue red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given outputs.
Rule: dax -> green

This rule is derived from the given examples where every instance of the word ""dax"" corresponds to an output of ""green.""
From the provided examples, we can derive the following associations:

1. zup always results in yellow.
2. bluf always results in red, except when it comes after wif, in which case it results in green.
3. lug always results in blue.
4. dax always results in green.
5. walm when preceded by zup results in yellow.
6. When wif is present it results in red but appears to influence the color associated with the word following it (as seen with ""bluf"" changing from its usual red to green when following ""wif"").

Analyzing these, ""wif"" seems to translate to the color red. Additionally, when ""wif"" is directly followed by another color word, it appears to change the output color for that word. However, with the limited examples, it is difficult to deduce the exact rule of how ""wif"" affects the following word, other than the one instance of ""bluf"" turning into green instead of its usual red. 

Given the above observations, the best we can say is:

wif -> red when standing alone or at the beginning, but may modify the output color of the word that follows it.
zup -> meaning. Rule: zup translates to yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" translates into the color that was mentioned just before it. To confirm this, let's break down each example:

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and is mentioned before ""bluf,"" so ""bluf"" translates to ""green."" However, in the Output, we see ""bluf"" translated to ""yellow,"" which follows ""zup"" which is equal to ""yellow."" This suggests that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it if that word corresponds to a color.
  
- In the second example, ""wif"" stands for ""red,"" and it precedes ""bluf,"" resulting in ""bluf"" being translated to ""red"" again.
  
- In the third example, ""dax"" comes before ""bluf,"" which should mean ""bluf"" would translate to ""green,"" and indeed it does so in the output.
  
- The fourth example simply has ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" meaning ""bluf"" takes ""red,"" which is consistent with the rule.

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup"" prefaces ""bluf"" and translates to ""yellow,"" so ""bluf"" also takes the color ""yellow"" in this case.

Thus, the rule for ""bluf"" can be stated as follows:

Rule: bluf -> Takes on the color of the immediately preceding color-associated word. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" ""bluf"" means ""green""; if it is ""wif,"" ""bluf"" means ""red""; and if it is ""zup,"" ""bluf"" means ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the last color-coded word before it. Here is the analysis:

1. In ""dax walm zup walm,"" ""dax"" leads to ""green"" being outputted, and then ""walm"" causes ""green"" to be repeated. The same happens with ""zup"" and ""yellow.""
2. In ""lug wif dax zup walm,"" ""zup"" is last and associated with ""yellow,"" which is then repeated after ""walm.""
3. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" leads to ""red"" being outputted, and ""walm"" then repeats this color.
4. ""zup walm dax lug"" does not repeat ""yellow"" immediately after ""walm"" because ""dax"" intervenes with ""green,"" and ""lug"" follows with ""blue.""
5. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" start with ""green"" after ""dax,"" then ""zup"" changes it to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" triggers ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color of the last color-coded word before it, unless intervened by a new color-coded word after ""walm.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue."" Other words like ""zup"" and ""dax"" correspond to ""yellow"" and ""green"" respectively, while ""wif"" corresponds to ""red."" Here, we see that each nonce word is paired with a specific color, and the pattern remains consistent throughout all examples.

Rule: lug -> blue
Analyzing the examples given, it seems each instance of ""dax"" consistently outputs ""green,"" regardless of what other words it appears with. In contrast, other words like ""wif,"" ""walm,"" and ""lug"" result in different output colors depending on their position or surrounding words. 

Since ""dax"" is the only word that consistently translates to the same color, it suggests that ""dax"" has a direct and unchanging translation to ""green,"" independent of context. Other words likely have rules governing their translations based on sequence or combination, but for ""dax,"" we can safely deduce:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Each example where the word ""zup"" appears, the word ""yellow"" is included in the output at the same position. No other inputs vary this outcome. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> blue

The examples provided show that when the word ""bluf"" is used, the word ""blue"" appears in the output. Despite the context or other words present, ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""blue.""
Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" appears to correlate with a repeated color in the output. If we carefully analyze the repetition of colors corresponding to the occurrences of the word ""walm,"" we can attempt to deduce its meaning.

Let's examine each example:

Example 1: zup dax walm   
Output: yellow green green green

Example 2: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm   
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue

Example 3: dax walm wif   
Output: green green green red

Example 4: zup walm lug wif   
Output: yellow yellow yellow blue red

Example 5: dax walm   
Output: green green green

The word ""walm"" seems to cause the preceding color to be repeated three times. For instance, in the first example, ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" and the color ""green"" is output three times. In the second example, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" and the color ""red"" is output three times.

Rule: ""walm"" -> Repeat the color output of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, it is clear that the word ""lug"" directly translates to a specific color in the outputs. In every case where ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output.

Therefore, the rule is:

lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: Each instance of the word ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in a sequence or the presence of other words, ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red.""

Therefore, the rule is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" occurs in the input, the color ""red"" is included in the output.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of context or position in a sequence.
Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color that the word preceding it translates to. If ""bluf"" is the first word or follows ""zup,"" it defaults to ""yellow.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" seems to correspond to the repetition of the color of the word that precedes it. To break it down:

1. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow."" Since ""zup"" is followed by ""walm,"" ""walm"" seems to represent two additional ""yellow"" colors following it.

2. The second example is identical to the first and yields the same output, supporting the idea that ""walm"" repeats the color of the preceding word.

3. ""lug walm wif lug"" translates to ""blue blue blue red blue,"" which indicates that ""walm"" represents two additional ""blue"" colors following ""lug."" 

4. ""wif walm dax"" translates to ""red red red green,"" again showing that ""walm"" results in two additional ""red"" colors after ""wif."" 

5. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Here, ""walm"" comes after ""dax,"" which is associated with ""green,"" and the output is two additional ""green"" colors.

Based on these observations, the rule seems to be:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word two additional times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green. Rule: Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within a sequence. Hence, the rule is straightforward:

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"", regardless of its position within the sequence of words. Here is the rule inferred from the examples:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> repetition of the preceding color.

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""bluf"" is used, it indicates that the color word preceding ""bluf"" should be repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look for patterns that correspond to when the word appears and what the output is.

- In the first example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" and followed by ""lug,"" and the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif"" and the output is ""red red red.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is between ""zup"" and ""lug"" in the first instance and between ""zup"" and ""wif"" in the second instance, with the outputs being ""yellow"" and ""yellow yellow,"" respectively.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" directly follows a ""lug"" and is followed by a ""zup,"" resulting in ""blue blue,"" and the second ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" resulting in ""yellow.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and the output for ""walm"" is ""blue blue.""

From these observations, it seems that ""walm"" outputs a sequence of colors. Specifically, each ""walm"" seems to duplicate the color of the word directly preceding it at least once. In cases where ""walm"" is followed by the word ""wif,"" it additionally generates the color ""red"" after duplicating the preceding color.

Hence, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be as follows:

Rule: ""walm"" duplicates the color of the word that precedes it, and whenever followed by ""wif,"" it also appends ""red.""

So:
walm -> Duplicates the preceding color, and if followed by ""wif,"" append ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each example provided.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a specific color. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"". Other words seem to have their own color associations as well. Here are the deductions:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"".
- ""wif"" translates to ""red"" given its consistent appearance before the output ""red"".
- ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", seen when it precedes the output ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", deduced from instances where it precedes the output ""blue"".

Accordingly, the rule seems to be that each word corresponds to a specific color when translated to the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
Rule: ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"". Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's analyze each example:

1. Input: dax bluf zup | Output: green green yellow
- ""dax"" and ""zup"" change colors from example to example, but ""bluf"" always remains the same color.

2. Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf | Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- The color for ""bluf"" is the same as for the word before it, ""wif.""

3. Input: zup bluf | Output: yellow yellow
- ""bluf"" takes on the same color as ""zup,"" which is directly before it.

4. Input: zup bluf lug dax lug | Output: yellow yellow blue green blue
- Again, ""bluf"" has the same color as the word before it, ""zup.""

5. Input: wif bluf dax walm | Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""bluf"" again shares its color with the preceding word, ""wif.""

Based on these examples, it seems that ""bluf"" takes on the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the previous word in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""walm"" when used after a color word, changes the color to red if the color is green, to blue if the color is yellow, and to yellow in any other case. If ""walm"" is used multiple times in succession, it continues to apply this change rule to the color that resulted from the previous application of ""walm"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug bluf dax
    ",Output: blue blue green,blue blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it is possible to deduce that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue. In each example, whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the output always includes the color ""blue,"" regardless of the other words present.

Thus, the rule is:

lug -> blue.
dax -> green

Rule: In every example provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green."" No context or variation changes this mapping: regardless of the position in the sequence or the surrounding words, ""dax"" always results in ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output includes ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples given:

- When ""bluf"" follows ""zup"", the output does not include ""red"", suggesting ""zup"" affects the output differently than when ""bluf"" is preceded by ""wif"".
- When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is always ""red red"".
- When ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"", ""walm"", or appears alone after ""wif"", there isn't a consistent pattern that correlates with the presence of ""bluf"". It is possible that ""bluf"" is not the only factor affecting the output.

The pattern for the meaning of ""bluf"" can't be precisely determined from the given examples, except when it immediately follows the word ""wif"". In that case, the output consistently includes ""red red"". It suggests that in this specific context at least, ""wif bluf"" corresponds to ""red red"". Outside of this context, we don't have sufficient information to accurately assign a meaning to ""bluf"".

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", it corresponds to an output of ""red red"".
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we should look at the patterns of input and output across the provided examples:

1. wif walm dax -> red red red green
2. zup walm -> yellow yellow yellow
3. zup wif dax walm lug -> yellow red green green green blue
4. lug wif dax zup walm -> blue red green yellow yellow yellow
5. lug wif dax walm zup -> blue red green green green yellow

Looking at these examples, we can attempt to identify a pattern:

- When ""walm"" is immediately followed by another word, the output is three repetitions of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm"" followed by another color.
- When ""walm"" is at the end with no words following it, the color pattern is the repetition of the color associated with the word immediately preceding ""walm.""

In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""dax,"" which seems to be associated with the color green because ""dax"" alone or following ""wif"" results in green. Therefore, we get the sequence ""red red red green"" in example 1 when ""walm"" follows ""dax."" In examples 3 and 5, ""walm"" follows the ""dax"" and again we have a green color after the sequence that matches the preceding pattern (yellow red green and blue red green respectively). It seems that ""walm"" introduces a green when it follows ""dax.""

In example 2, ""walm"" is directly preceded by ""zup,"" which seems to be associated with yellow because ""zup"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow."" We're missing an additional color here to complete the pattern as seen with ""dax,"" so we might assume that ""walm"" could dictate yellow again following the established pattern.

In example 4 ""walm"" follows ""zup"" but ""walm"" is not the last word in the sequence and the color pattern is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which is consistent with the pattern established in example 2.

The rule seems to be that ""walm"" uses the color associated with the preceding word for its output but with a caveat based on the word following ""walm"". It either repeats the same color three times if it's at the end or is followed by something other than ""lug"" or ""dax"", or follows with ""green"" if preceded specifically by ""dax"".

Therefore, the rule of ""walm"" could be described as:

Rule: walm -> When walm is preceded by x, output three instances of the color associated with x, followed by green if it's either the last word in the sequence or followed by a word other than ""lug"" or ""dax""; if followed by ""lug"" or ""dax"", then output green after three instances of the color associated with the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that each instance of a nonce word corresponds to a specific color. The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" every time it appears. Hence, the rule appears to be a direct association between the word and its color representation. 

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"". When ""zup"" is present in the input, ""yellow"" will always be present in the output, regardless of its position or the presence of other words.
Rule: bluf means to repeat the color associated with the previous word. 

- In ""dax lug bluf dax,"" ""lug"" was associated with blue, so bluf caused blue to be repeated, then ""dax"" was associated with green.
- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" was associated with yellow, so bluf caused yellow to be repeated.
- In ""zup wif bluf,"" ""wif"" was associated with red, so bluf caused red to be repeated after ""wif.""
- In ""zup bluf wif,"" ""bluf"" repeated ""zup's"" yellow before ""wif"" changed the output to red.
- In ""lug wif bluf,"" ""wif"" was associated with red, so bluf caused red to be repeated after ""wif.""
Analyzing the provided examples, we can discern a pattern related to the word ""walm"" and its corresponding output color. In the given examples:

1. Each time ""walm"" appears, the word before it seems to dictate the color repeated in the output.
2. ""walm"" itself does not correspond to a single, consistent color.

Here are the patterns for each instance of ""walm"":

- In the first example, ""walm"" appears after ""lug"" (blue) and ""zup"" (yellow), and in the output, blue and yellow are repeated following ""walm.""
- In the second and third examples, ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" (green), and green is repeated in the output.
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), and yellow is repeated in the output.
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" (yellow), and yellow is repeated in the output.

From this, we can formulate the following rule:

walm -> meaning: When ""walm"" appears after a word, the meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color corresponding to that word in the output.

Rule: If ""walm"" follows a word associated with a particular color, the output will be the same color repeated based on the preceding word associated with that color.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""dax"" maps to the color ""green."" To be certain of this rule, we must ensure that no matter where ""dax"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""green."" Let's examine each case:

- In every instance where ""dax"" appears, regardless of its position in the sequence, the output always contains ""green"" in the corresponding position.
- The other words in the inputs (""zup,"" ""wif,"" ""walm,"" ""lug"") are associated with different colors, and their corresponding outputs are consistently the same: ""zup"" correlates with ""yellow,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""walm"" with ""green,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue.""

As a result, the rule can be formulated as follows:

Rule: dax -> ""green"" 

The meaning is consistent regardless of context, and ""dax"" always results in the output of the color ""green.""
Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can try to deduce the meaning or rule behind the nonce word ""zup"". Here is the analysis of the examples:

1. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" -> ""blue red green green green yellow""
2. ""zup dax lug walm zup lug"" -> ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow blue""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""zup dax zup wif"" -> ""yellow green yellow red""
5. ""lug zup"" -> ""blue yellow""

Analyzing the examples, it looks like ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" consistently. To further validate this, we look at the context in which ""zup"" appears:

- In examples 1 and 5, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" without any additional context needed.
- In example 2, ""zup"" appears both at the beginning and within the sequence, and in both cases, the word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In example 3 and 4, ""zup"" is at the beginning, and it still corresponds to ""yellow.""

We don't have any examples that contradict the idea that ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow."" Consequently, it is reasonable to conclude that ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position within the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Given the examples, it appears that ""bluf"" duplicates the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it.

Rule: ""bluf"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.
Rule: The word ""walm"" is a repeat function that repeats the last color mentioned three times.

Explanation:
1. In ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" and the nonce word ""walm"" causes ""red"" to be repeated three times.
2. In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""green"" three times.
3. In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" translates to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times.
4. In ""zup wif walm lug,"" ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, and ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""
5. In ""dax wif walm lug zup walm,"" ""dax"" translates to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" ""walm"" repeats ""red"" three times, ""lug"" to ""blue,"" ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" and the second ""walm"" repeats ""yellow"" three times.

walm -> Repeats the last mentioned color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. This can be observed by its correlation in each example where ""lug"" appears.

So, the rule for ""lug"" would be:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the input-output pairs provided:

- When ""dax"" appears alone, the output is just ""green.""
- When ""dax"" appears with other nonce words, there is always a ""green"" in the output corresponding to its position.

Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
Reviewing the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the underlying rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""zup"". The objective is to correlate ""zup"" with the color it represents in the outputs.

Input: zup bluf dax
Output: yellow yellow green

Here, ""zup"" corresponds to the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: wif bluf lug zup
Output: red red blue yellow

In this case, ""zup"" is the last word in the input and corresponds to the last ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup bluf lug
Output: yellow yellow blue

Here again, ""zup"" is the first word in the input and is represented by the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Input: zup
Output: yellow

With only ""zup"" in the input, the output is simply ""yellow.""

Input: zup wif dax wif bluf
Output: yellow red green red red

In this last example, ""zup"" is the first word and matches the first ""yellow"" in the output.

Based on these observations, we can infer that regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""zup"" always translates to the color ""yellow"" in the output. There is no evidence to suggest that ""zup"" has a contextual meaning that changes dependent on other words or its position in the input.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> green
To deduce the meaning of the word ""walm,"" let's look at the output whenever ""walm"" appears and compare it with the surrounding context:

Input: lug walm dax wif lug wif
Output: blue blue blue green red blue red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""blue green,"" which could signify two color outputs. However, the next word ""dax"" alone corresponds to ""green."" Therefore, it seems that ""walm"" corresponds to a single ""blue.""

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- Here, ""walm"" is at the end and translates to a single ""green"" since ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""green green.""

Input: zup walm wif
Output: yellow yellow yellow red
- ""walm"" is followed by ""yellow,"" just like ""zup,"" but ""wif"" at the end translates to ""red.""

Input: zup walm
Output: yellow yellow yellow
- ""walm"" follows ""zup"" and produces ""yellow."" Since no other color follows, ""walm"" aligns with ""yellow"" as it mirrors the output of ""zup.""

Input: wif dax lug walm
Output: red green blue blue blue
- ""walm"" is at the end and corresponds to ""blue blue."" Here again, it appears that ""walm"" adds one ""blue"" to the sequence since ""lug"" before ""walm"" accounted for a single ""blue.""

In each instance, ""walm"" adds a single color to the sequence. It is consistent with producing ""blue"" when following ""lug"" and ""green"" when following ""dax,"" while mirroring ""yellow"" with ""zup."" However, when ""walm"" directly follows ""wif,"" the color is ""green"" except for when there's an additional word after ""walm,"" then it turns ""red.""

Based on the evidence provided, it seems that ""walm"" can change the color depending on the context, but the consistent rule is that it adds one instance of a color to the sequence. Given the ambiguity when following ""wif,"" we may need more examples to establish a clearer pattern. However, the general rule around ""lug,"" ""zup,"" and ""dax"" seems more straightforward.

Rule: walm causes the output of a single color, seemingly context-dependent with potential for multiple meanings:
- After ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue.""
- After ""zup,"" it becomes ""yellow.""
- After ""dax,"" it becomes ""green.""
- After ""wif,"" the pattern is unclear with at least one case leading to ""green"" and another to ""red."" More examples would be needed to determine a precise rule.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Analyzing the given examples, I will find a pattern corresponding to the word ""dax"" and what it translates to in each output sequence.

1. lug dax -> blue green
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. wif dax -> red green
4. zup bluf wif dax wif zup -> yellow yellow red green red yellow
5. dax wif walm -> green red red red

From the examples, it appears that ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.

1. When ""lug"" precedes ""dax,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" followed by ""dax,"" which is ""green.""
2. When ""dax"" precedes ""lug,"" it leads with ""green,"" followed by ""lug,"" which is ""blue,"" and ""walm,"" which consistently translates to a repetition of the color corresponding to the preceding word, in this case, ""blue.""
3. With ""wif dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" follows as ""green.""
4. In the sequence ""zup bluf wif dax wif zup,"" none of the instances of ""dax"" affect other words, and it directly translates to ""green.""
5. With ""dax wif walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""walm"" again repeats the color corresponding to the preceding word, ""red.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, the rule appears to be as follows:

wif -> red

Each instance of the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the output. Following this pattern:

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow""
- ""lug bluf wif lug bluf zup"" translates to ""blue blue red blue blue yellow"" (with ""wif"" specifically corresponding to ""red"")
- ""wif lug"" translates to ""red blue""
- A single ""wif"" translates to ""red""
- The repeated example ""wif zup"" confirms the translation as ""red yellow"" again.

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""zup"" indicates a change of color in the sequence. Specifically, each instance of ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, and it seems to occur in between other distinct colors that have their own corresponding outputs. Therefore, the rule appears to be:

zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow in the output sequence.
Rule: bluf -> yellow
Based on the given examples, walm appears to replicate the color associated with the word that precedes it, and the number of times it is replicated appears to be three. Each word seems to have a corresponding color as follows:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- wif -> red
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, when ""walm"" follows any of these words, the output is the color corresponding to the preceding word repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> meaning. The meaning inferred is the color ""red"".

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" in the outputs.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow each time it appears. It doesn't seem to change its meaning depending on the context. The presence of ""zup"" in an input string always results in ""yellow"" in the output string.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word multiple times (specifically, three times).

Explanation: In each example, we can see that when the word ""walm"" appears after a color word, the output is the color of the previous word repeated three times.

- In ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" and the output after ""walm"" is ""blue"" repeated three times.
- In ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" so after ""walm,"" we get ""green"" repeated three times.
- ""lug walm zup lug walm"" displays ""lug"" yielding ""blue,"" followed by ""walm"" producing ""blue blue blue,"" then ""zup"" for ""yellow,"" and finally ""walm"" yielding another ""blue blue blue"" because the last color word before it was ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup walm"" has ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" so ""walm"" leads to ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- ""lug walm zup walm"" showcases ""lug"" as ""blue,"" after which ""walm"" repeats ""blue"" three times, followed by ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" again repeats the color of the previous word (""yellow"") three times.

Therefore, walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we observe the following patterns:

- Whenever the word 'lug' appears after another word, it changes the color output of the latter word.
- For example, in the first input, the word 'wif' normally produces the output 'red', but when followed by 'lug', the output is 'blue'.
- Similarly, 'walm' usually results in 'red', but after 'lug', it yields 'blue blue blue'.
- The word 'zup' normally results in 'yellow', but followed by 'lug' it changes to 'blue'.
- When 'lug' is at the end or only followed by 'dax', which outputs 'green', it does not cause a repetition in colors.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: The word 'lug' changes the color output of the word preceding it to 'blue'. If the preceding word normally repeats colors multiple times (like 'walm' which turns into 'red red red'), 'lug' makes it repeat 'blue' the same number of times. If there's no word to modify (i.e., 'lug' is the last word or followed by 'dax'), 'lug' simply outputs 'blue' once. 

lug -> changes previous word's color output to 'blue' or outputs 'blue' if it is the last word or before 'dax'.
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the inputs and outputs provided, whenever the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position. Other words seem consistent with specific colors as well: ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"". It does not seem to alter its meaning based on context. Therefore:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow in the given examples. Each example shows that the input ""zup"" consistently results in the output ""yellow"".
Based on the provided examples, each nonce word appears to correspond to a color, and the pattern also suggests that bluf's meaning is affected by the word immediately preceding it in the sequence. Let's analyze the examples.

- In examples where the word ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""dax"" (which corresponds to the color green), the output for ""bluf"" is ""green.""
- In the example where the word ""bluf"" is immediately preceded by ""zup"" (which corresponds to the color yellow), the output for ""bluf"" is ""yellow.""
- There is no example where ""bluf"" is preceded by ""lug"" (which corresponds to the color blue) or ""wif"" (which corresponds to the color red), so we can't deduce its output in these specific cases from the given data.

From this, it appears that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that precedes it. However, there could be further rules or exceptions that aren't evident from the provided data. Given the examples, the best deduction is:

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word. If preceded by ""dax,"" it's green; if preceded by ""zup,"" it's yellow. Further information would be needed to define its behavior after ""lug"" or ""wif.""
Rule: walm -> repeats the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

Explanation:

- In the first example, ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" the color associated with ""dax"" is green and with ""lug"" is blue. ""Walm"" follows ""dax"" and ""lug"" each time and results in three greens and three blues, respectively.
  
- In the second example, ""wif walm lug bluf,"" ""wif"" is associated with red and ""lug"" with blue. Following ""wif walm,"" we see three reds and following ""lug bluf,"" we see two blues. 

- In the third example, ""dax walm zup,"" ""dax"" is associated with green. ""Walm"" results in three greens following ""dax.""

- In the fourth example, ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" is associated with green, ""lug"" with blue. ""Walm"" follows the second ""lug"" and results in three blues.

- In the fifth example, ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" is associated with blue and ""walm"" results in three blues.

Therefore, the presence of ""walm"" causes the color of the word before it to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug
    ",Output: green blue,green blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""lug"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" Consequently, when ""lug"" is used, it is replaced with ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: lug -> blue.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" we should look for patterns in the examples provided. Let's consider how ""dax"" may change the color output in each example, taking into account the colors that appear when ""dax"" is combined with other words:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green yellow blue
2. dax bluf -> green green
3. dax bluf wif -> green green red
4. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
5. dax walm -> green green green

Assuming that each word in the input corresponds to a color in the output and that the order of the words matters, we can try to identify the unique contribution of ""dax"" to the output. In every example where ""dax"" appears, the output always starts with green, suggesting that ""dax"" may correspond to the color green. 

Now, let's look at the instances where other words are introduced alongside ""dax"":

- ""walm"" always results in an additional green following ""dax.""
- The presence of ""bluf,"" regardless of what follows, consistently generates a second green after the initial green that we've attributed to ""dax.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to yellow.
- Finally, ""lug"" seems to correspond to blue.

Given that ""dax"" by itself results in green green, we can posit that ""dax"" not only contributes one green but results in a repeating pattern of green. Therefore, ""dax"" could mean ""repeat the following color(s)"" or, more specifically, it could represent the instruction ""start with green and repeat the next color.""

Rule: dax -> Start with green and repeat the next color (if there is one). If there is no next color, just output green.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" appears to correlate with the color ""red."" In each example where ""wif"" is an input, the output consistently includes ""red."" It doesn't seem to matter the position of ""wif"" within the sequence of words; its corresponding output is always ""red."" Also, other words seem to have their own color associations as well, such as ""lug"" consistently mapping to ""blue.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" consistently across all examples provided.
From the given examples, we can try to induce the rule behind the word ""bluf"" by comparing inputs to outputs in each line.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

Here, ""bluf"" seems to correspond to the word ""red,"" as it directly follows ""wif,"" which outputs to ""red.""

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

In this example, ""bluf"" also mirrors the color specified before it, ""blue"" in this case.

Input: wif bluf
Output: red red

The repetition of the first example confirms the pattern we saw earlier, where ""bluf"" produces ""red"" following ""wif.""

Input: dax wif bluf
Output: green red red

Here, ""bluf"" still outputs ""red,"" the same as when following ""wif,"" while ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

In this longer example, we see ""bluf"" following both ""dax"" and ""wif,"" each time mirroring the color mentioned just before it: ""green"" after ""dax"" and ""red"" after ""wif."" Additionally, when ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and precedes ""lug,"" the output is ""yellow"" and ""blue,"" respectively, suggesting that ""bluf"" acts as a sort of echo for the previous color mentioned.

Rule:
bluf -> meaning. Bluf seems to repeat or echo the color word that immediately precedes it.
Based on the provided input-output pairs, it seems that the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word that comes before it multiple times. To be specific, it repeats the color three times.

Here's the breakdown of the rule concerning ""walm"":

1. In the first example ""dax lug walm"", ""dax"" is ""green,"" and ""lug"" is ""blue"". The output for ""walm"" here is ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" translates to three repetitions of ""blue,"" which is the color associated with ""lug.""

2. In the second example ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"", ""lug"" is ""blue,"" so ""walm"" following it becomes ""blue blue blue."" The pattern does not change despite the appearance of other words like ""zup"" and ""wif,"" which have different colors.

3. In the third example ""dax walm zup lug walm"", the first ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, so ""walm"" becomes ""green green green."" The second ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which is blue, and so ""walm"" becomes ""blue blue blue.""

4. In the fourth example ""dax lug walm zup wif"", ""walm"" follows ""lug"" again and becomes ""blue blue blue.""

5. In the fifth example ""wif bluf dax walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is green, resulting in ""green green green.""

Based on these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repetition of the color of the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Each instance of ""dax"" in the input results in ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position or the other words present. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green
By analyzing the given examples and their corresponding outputs, we can try to identify the rule for what ""wif"" means:

- In the first example, ""wif"" is followed by ""lug"" and in the output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". So here, ""wif"" might mean ""red"".

- In the second example, ""wif"" precedes ""zup"", and in the output, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". In this instance, ""wif"" still appears to mean ""red"".

- In the third example, ""wif"" comes before ""walm"" and the output for ""wif"" is again ""red"", while ""walm"" is ""red"" as well. This example still supports that ""wif"" might mean ""red"".

- In the fourth example, there is no word before ""wif"", and it corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

- In the fifth example, ""wif"" is present twice in the input: once at the beginning and once at the end. On both occasions, the output for ""wif"" is ""red"".

Considering all examples, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the input or the words that precede or follow it, ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Each time the word ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding output. It does not seem to be dependent on the context or position in the sequence.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each occurrence of ""bluf"" in the input is translated to ""red"" in the output.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word three times. 

The examples show that whenever the word ""walm"" follows another word, the output color is the same as the previous word and is repeated three times. For instance, when ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which is associated with the color green, the output is ""green"" three times. Similarly, when ""walm"" follows ""zup"" or ""lug,"" associated with the colors yellow and blue respectively, the output color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif dax
    ",Output: red green red green,red green red green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: dax corresponds to the color green in the given context.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates directly to the colour ""red"" consistently, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the word ""zup"" correlates with the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, we can deduce that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" when it follows the word ""zup"" and ""green"" when it follows the word ""dax."" However, the examples don't show ""bluf"" following any other words apart from ""zup"" and ""dax"". The data we have suggests a pattern where the meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word immediately preceding it.

Here is the observed pattern:

1. When ""bluf"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow"":
   - zup bluf -> yellow yellow
   - zup lug zup bluf -> yellow blue yellow yellow

2. When ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green"":
   - dax bluf -> green green
   - dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow
   
Let's also pay attention to whether ""bluf"" following different words produces a consistent color:

3. dax bluf wif zup wif -> green green red yellow red
4. zup bluf wif lug dax -> yellow yellow red blue green

In example 3, ""bluf"" follows ""dax"" and the output is ""green."" In example 4, ""bluf"" follows ""zup"" and the output is ""yellow."" Hence we can assume that ""bluf"" after ""zup"" is ""yellow"" and ""bluf"" after ""dax"" is ""green.""

However, the examples provided are not sufficient to define a rule for ""bluf"" when following words other than ""zup"" or ""dax,"" or when ""bluf"" starts a sequence. Additional examples would be necessary to accurately determine if ""bluf"" has a default color or if the rule changes with different preceding words.

Rule:
- bluf following zup -> yellow
- bluf following dax -> green
The examples suggest that the word ""walm"" indicates a repetition of the output color associated with the word preceding it three times. In each instance, the word before ""walm"" determines the color that is then repeated three times:

- ""zup walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow yellow"", hence ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" outputs ""green green green"", so ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"".
- When ""walm"" follows a sequence involving two different words/colors, it causes the last mentioned color to repeat three times, as seen in ""wif dax lug walm"" (wif = red, dax = green, lug = blue) resulting in ""red green blue blue blue"", and in ""dax wif walm"" (dax = green, wif = red) resulting in ""green red red red"".

Therefore, it appears that ""walm"" is a command to take the last mentioned color and repeat it three times in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in every given output regardless of its position or the context in which it is used.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in each occurrence, regardless of its position in the input string or the words that surround it. Thus, the rule appears to be consistent and position-independent.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color in each output. Here are the observations:

- When ""wif"" is present in the input, the word ""red"" appears in the same position in the output.
- There is no apparent dependency on the words that come before or after ""wif"" for it to translate to ""red"" in the output.

Therefore, we can induce the following rule:

wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow. Every time ""zup"" is mentioned, the output includes the color yellow.
bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, it translates to the color ""blue.""
Based on the given examples, the word ""walm"" appears to duplicate the color indicated by the word immediately preceding it three times. Specifically:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" stands for yellow, and ""walm"" produces three additional yellows.
- In ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm,"" ""walm"" follows ""bluf,"" which stands for yellow, and produces three additional yellows.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""lug"" stands for blue, and ""walm"" results in three more blues.
- In ""zup walm,"" there is no word between ""zup"" and ""walm,"" so ""walm"" repeats the color indicated by ""zup"" (yellow) three times.
- In ""wif zup walm dax zup,"" ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" which stands for yellow, and three additional yellows are produced. The remaining words ""dax zup"" produce colors independently of ""walm.""

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color indicated by the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the output. Each occurrence of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output, regardless of the neighboring words. Therefore, the rule is as follows:

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""dax"" by looking at its position and the corresponding output colors. Here are the observations:

1. Whenever ""dax"" appears, the output always contains the color ""green.""

2. The position of ""dax"" in the input seems to correspond with the position of ""green"" in the output.

So, here's the induction based on the examples:

- ""zup dax"" corresponds to ""yellow green,"" so ""zup"" gives ""yellow"" and ""dax"" gives ""green"".
- ""dax wif bluf"" gives ""green red red,"" so ""dax"" is again ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red,"" and ""bluf"" is ""red.""
- ""zup bluf dax"" produces ""yellow yellow green,"" where ""zup"" gives the first ""yellow,"" ""bluf"" gives the second ""yellow,"" and ""dax"" corresponds with ""green.""
- ""lug dax"" translates to ""blue green,"" so ""lug"" gives ""blue"" and ""dax"" gives ""green.""
- ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" becomes ""green yellow red red blue,"" where each word corresponds to ""green,"" ""yellow,"" ""red,"" ""red,"" and ""blue"" respectively, in the order they occur in the input.

Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"".
Based on the provided examples, each unique word corresponds to a unique color. The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every given input where it appears. Consequently, the rule can be defined as:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Rule: bluf -> red
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look at the outputs and the position of ""walm"" relative to other words in every input.

Examining each input and output pair:

1. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - Here, ""walm"" results in one ""green.""

2. Input: wif bluf dax bluf wif walm lug wif
   Output: red red green green red red red blue red
   - The ""walm"" here comes after five colors, with the last two being ""red red,"" and results in ""red.”

3. Input: zup walm dax lug
   Output: yellow yellow yellow green blue
   - The ""walm"" appears after two ""yellow""s and results in another ""yellow.""

4. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - The ""walm"" follows a ""blue"" and a ""yellow"" and leads to another ""yellow.""

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - The ""walm"" is between ""yellow blue"" and matches the preceding color, ""blue.""

From examining these examples, it appears that ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color that directly precedes it. So if the word before ""walm"" results in the color ""green,"" ""walm"" will also result in ""green,"" and so on.

Rule: walm -> the same color as the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax lug zup
    ",Output: green blue yellow,green blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in every given example, regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"". Therefore, the rule appears to be:

wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" means red.
Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" 

Each instance of ""zup"" results in the output of ""yellow,"" regardless of the additional words that follow. The other words following ""zup"" correspond to their own specific colors (""lug"" to ""blue"", ""walm"" to ""green"", and ""wif"" to ""red"").

Therefore: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, we can deduce that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output word ""red."" Each time ""bluf"" appears in the input, the output contains the word ""red."" When ""bluf"" appears twice, the output contains ""red"" twice.

Therefore, the rule is:

bluf -> red
walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the next color word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be that the nonce word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"". This is evident as ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" in every instance of the input-output pairs.

Rule: lug -> blue.
Based on the examples provided and the consistent output, we can infer the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" always corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's look at each instance of ""zup"" and the corresponding output color:

1. wif walm dax zup -> red red red green yellow
2. wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
3. wif bluf zup bluf wif -> red red yellow yellow red
4. lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
5. lug zup dax zup -> blue yellow green yellow

By comparing the outputs to the inputs, we can observe that:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""dax"" corresponds to green.
- ""walm"" corresponds to blue (""lug walm"" is followed by three blue).
- ""bluf"" seems to correspond to yellow.

Knowing the above, we can see that whenever ""zup"" appears, the corresponding color is yellow. Additionally, ""zup"" does not seem to influence the color that comes after it, nor is there a discernable pattern that the color after ""zup"" follows; it is based on the corresponding word that comes thereafter.

Therefore, the rule for ""zup"" appears to be straightforward:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the outputs corresponding to the given inputs, it seems like each input word is translated into a color in the outputs. The word ""bluf"" consistently translates to the same color as the word that precedes it. Considering this pattern, we can write the rule for the meaning of ""bluf"" as follows:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it in the sequence.

Rule: If a word is followed by ""bluf"", the output for ""bluf"" will be the same color as the output for the word before it.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears, it indicates that the color of the word immediately before it should be repeated for as many words as follow until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, the following deduction can be made about the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

Input: lug walm -> Output: blue blue blue
- The repetition of the color ""blue"" three times corresponds to each word in the input, with ""lug"" being the first instance of ""blue.""

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm -> Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
- Here, ""lug walm"" at the end of the input again corresponds with ""blue blue blue"" at the end of the output. This reinforces the idea that ""lug"" translates to ""blue.""

Input: lug bluf wif -> Output: blue blue red
- ""lug"" as the first word yields ""blue"" as the first color in the output, which is consistent with the previous examples.

Input: lug -> Output: blue
- ""lug"" on its own results in ""blue,"" further supporting that ""lug"" signifies the color ""blue.""

Input: lug zup wif -> Output: blue yellow red
- Once more, ""lug"" at the beginning corresponds to ""blue"" at the beginning of the output sequence. 

Rule:
lug -> ""blue""
dax -> green

Rule:
The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the sequence. This can be observed as ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in all provided examples.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" This is evident because, in every example where ""wif"" is present, the corresponding output includes the color ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in input, the output is ""yellow.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""bluf"", let's look at the correlation between the positions of ""bluf"" in the input and the corresponding output:

1. dax bluf zup -> green green yellow
2. wif zup bluf wif dax -> red yellow yellow red green
3. zup bluf lug dax lug -> yellow yellow blue green blue
4. zup dax zup dax wif bluf -> yellow green yellow green red red
5. dax bluf wif lug zup -> green green red blue yellow

In each example, ""bluf"" corresponds with the second color mentioned in the output. The second color is as follows for each example:

1. green
2. yellow
3. yellow
4. red
5. green

At a glance, the color that ""bluf"" corresponds to does not appear to be directly related to its position in the input. However, by examining other patterns across inputs and outputs, we see that ""bluf"" matches the color of the word that precedes it:

1. dax -> green, bluf -> green
2. zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow
3. zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow
4. wif -> red, bluf -> red
5. dax -> green, bluf -> green

Thus, the rule we can deduce is that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that appears immediately before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color of the preceding word.
walm -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

To deduce the meaning of 'walm', we must look for patterns and inconsistencies in the given examples. Let's try to find a rule based on the presence of 'walm' and the associated output colors.

In example 2, 'walm' appears twice:
- After 'w-if', and the colors are ""red yellow yellow yellow"".
- After 'zup', and the colors are ""blue yellow yellow yellow"".

In example 3, 'walm' appears once:
- After 'dax', and the colors are ""green green green"".

In example 4, 'walm' appears once:
- After 'wif', and the colors are ""red red red"".

In example 5, 'walm' appears once:
- After 'zup', and the colors are ""yellow yellow yellow"".

Now, let's make some observations:
- The color before 'walm' never repeats in the output when 'walm' is present.
- 'Walm' seems to cause a repetition of colors, but the number of repetitions and the color that repeats depend on the word before 'walm'.

Let's analyze the words that come before 'walm' and their corresponding output colors:
- 'wif' -> red (repeats 3 times after 'walm')
- 'dax' -> green (repeats 3 times after 'walm')
- 'zup' -> yellow (repeats 3 times after 'walm')
- 'lug' -> blue (repeats once or does not seem to affect the output)

It's notable that after 'lug', the repetition is not clear, which might suggest an exception or a mistake. However, since we see 'lug' before 'walm' only once and 'walm' only seems to follow other specific words, and then it is followed by a repetition of three of the same color, let's hypothesize that there might be a typing error in example 1 related to 'lug'. With that possible exception aside, 'walm' seems to result in tripling the color that corresponds to the word before it (except when the word is 'lug' in example 1).

Therefore, the general rule could be:

Rule: 'walm' causes the color corresponding to the immediately preceding word to repeat three times in the output sequence (with uncertainty around 'lug' based on the provided examples).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green, irrespective of its position in the sequence or the other words surrounding it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red"". Since this output does not change regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present, we can deduce that ""wif"" stands for the color red, and no other context alters this meaning. 

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" we'll look at the patterns in the input and the corresponding output. We can break it down by each example:

1. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow

2. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

3. Input: dax zup
   Output: green yellow

4. Input: zup wif walm
   Output: yellow red red red

5. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red

Based on these examples, we can try to infer:

- ""zup"" always translates to ""yellow"" irrespective of its position in the input string.
- The word following ""zup"" seems to determine the length or number of colors in the output.
- ""walm"" after a ""zup"" leads to repetitions of ""red"" equal to the number of times ""walm"" is mentioned.
- ""wif"" after a ""zup"" always leads to a single red after the initial yellow.
- Other words like ""dax"" and ""lug"" lead to colors ""green"" and ""blue,"" respectively, even when they precede ""zup.""

Based on these observations, we can propose the following rule:

Rule: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" and when followed by another word, ""zup"" results in ""yellow"" followed by the colors corresponding to the words that come after it. With ""walm"" resulting in multiple ""red"" color outputs based on its occurrence, and ""wif"" consistently leading to a single ""red"" regardless of its occurrence.

So, zup -> ""yellow"".
bluf -> repeat the color word that comes before it

Rule: When the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it instructs to repeat the color word that immediately precedes it in the output.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: When the word ""walm"" appears in a sequence, it causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif zup bluf
    ",Output: red yellow red,red yellow yellow,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the provided examples, regardless of context or position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it appears that each word is being translated to a specific color. When comparing inputs with their respective outputs, ""wif"" seems to be consistently associated with the color red.

- In the first example, ""wif"" results in ""red red,"" indicating that ""wif"" corresponds to two reds in sequence.
- In the second example, ""wif"" is at the end and corresponds to a single ""red.""
- In the third example, ""wif"" alone translates to ""red red,"" reasserting the first example's pattern.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is followed by ""dax lug dax,"" and the output ""red green blue green"" seems to indicate that ""wif"" corresponds to red, while ""dax"" and ""lug"" have their own colors.
- In the last example, ""wif"" appears twice and both times it results in ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red

This seems to imply that ""wif"" means ""red"" or is a rule that results in the color red when translated.
 Reviewing the examples provided:

- Input: wif zup bluf lug -> Output: red yellow yellow blue
- Input: lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug -> Output: blue blue green blue yellow yellow yellow blue
- Input: zup wif bluf zup -> Output: yellow red red yellow
- Input: zup dax zup -> Output: yellow green yellow
- Input: wif zup -> Output: red yellow

We can note that every time the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. Furthermore, it is clear that ""zup"" does not depend on its position within the list as it consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of where it appears or what other words are present.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow""
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" acts as a mirror, causing the word immediately preceding it to repeat its color code. The word ""bluf"" does not have its own independent color but rather causes a repetition of the color of the word before it. We see this occurring in every example where the color that follows ""bluf"" is a repeat of the color that precedes it:

- Example 1: ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""; ""bluf"" causes ""dax"" to repeat as ""green green"".
- Example 2: ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""; again, ""bluf"" causes ""dax"" to repeat as ""green green"".
- Example 3: ""wif bluf dax bluf wif"" shows ""red red green green red""; both instances of ""bluf"" cause their preceding word to repeat their color (""red"" and ""green"").
- Example 4: ""zup bluf dax"" -> ""yellow yellow green""; ""bluf"" causes ""zup"" to repeat as ""yellow yellow"".
- Example 5: ""dax bluf wif"" -> ""green green red""; ""bluf"" causes ""dax"" to repeat as ""green green"".

Therefore, the rule is: bluf -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat.

Rule: When ""bluf"" follows a word, the color code for that word is repeated.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"", let's examine the pattern of each input and the corresponding output. Each input word seems to be translated into a color in a consistent manner. For instance, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue.""

Let's analyze each input and its output in relation to the word ""walm"":

1. ""lug walm dax"" translates to ""blue blue blue green."" Since ""lug"" is ""blue"" and ""dax"" is ""green,"" that suggests ""walm"" means ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

2. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green yellow green green green red."" Here, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is translated to ""green,"" which supports the ""green"" translation when following ""dax.""

3. ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green."" Again, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is translated as ""green.""

4. ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green."" Here, ""walm"" is directly after ""dax"" and again translates to ""green.""

5. ""dax lug walm"" translates to ""green blue blue blue."" In this case, ""walm"" follows ""lug"" and translates to ""blue"" which would suggest ""walm"" means ""blue"" when it follows ""lug.""

It seems that ""walm"" takes on the color of the word preceding it:

- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it becomes ""blue.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" it becomes ""green.""
- There are no examples where ""walm"" is the first word, follows ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""bluf,"" or any word other than ""lug"" or ""dax,"" so the pattern is not clear for these cases.

Based on this information, the rule for ""walm"" appears to be that it replicates the color of the word preceding it. If we were to generalize this rule, it might look like this:

Rule: walm -> takes on the color of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Rules:
lug -> blue
Based on the given examples, it appears that words correspond to certain colors with ""dax"" consistently corresponding to the color green. Here's the breakdown of word-to-color associations based on the provided examples:

- ""dax"" always yields the output ""green.""
- ""zup"" always yields ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" is consistently followed by ""red.""
- ""lug"" is translated into ""blue.""
- ""walm"" becomes ""blue"" when following ""lug"" but is ""yellow"" otherwise.

As all instances of ""dax"" yield the output ""green,"" regardless of the words that come before or after it, we can deduce that:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word 'wif' correlates to the word 'red' in the output. In every example, whenever 'wif' is present in the input, 'red' appears in the corresponding position in the output. No other word in the input correlates with 'red' consistently.

Here are the associations from the examples:

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'walm' corresponds to 'blue'

Input: wif bluf dax lug
Output: red red green blue
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'red'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'

Input: lug dax zup dax walm wif
Output: blue green yellow green green green red
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'
- 'walm' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'

Input: dax wif zup dax
Output: green red yellow green
- 'dax' corresponds to 'green'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow'

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue
- 'lug' corresponds to 'blue'
- 'wif' corresponds to 'red'
- 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue'

By examining all these examples, we can conclude that regardless of the position of 'wif' within the input sequence, the output always has 'red' in the corresponding position. The context is consistent and does not seem to change the output associated with 'wif'.

Rule: wif -> 'red'
Based on the provided examples, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present. Thus, we can induce the rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue. The meaning of ""bluf"" consistently translates to the color blue across all examples provided.
walm -> meaning. The meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" appears to indicate repetition of the previous color mentioned.

Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-associated word, the output is a repetition of the color that corresponds to the previous word. For instance, if ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow,"" then ""zup walm"" yields ""yellow yellow yellow."" Similarly, ""wif walm"" results in ""red red red,"" and ""lug walm"" leads to ""blue blue blue.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif
    ",Output: green red,green red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.
Based on the provided examples, the rule seems to be related to converting words into colors. The word ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"". However, to understand the meaning of other words and how they translate to specific colors, we will need more data or examples. The words ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" need to be seen with their individual outputs to accurately deduce their corresponding colors.

From the given data:

- Whenever the input is solely ""dax,"" the output is ""green.""
- When combined with other words, ""dax"" still corresponds to ""green,"" but additional colors appear in the output.

Assuming the sequence of colors in the output corresponds to the sequence of words in the input:

- ""dax"" correlates to ""green.""
- ""wif"" could correlate to ""red"" (since it appears twice in the fourth input and three times in the output).
- ""zup"" might translate to ""yellow"" (based on its single occurrence in the fourth input and the sequence of colors).
- ""bluf"" might also translate to ""yellow.""
- ""walm"" seems to correlate to ""red"" as it appears only once in the fifth input but corresponds with three ""red"" in the output.

Rule:
- dax -> green
- By extension, possibly: wif -> red, zup -> yellow, bluf -> yellow, walm -> red

However, the uncertainty due to the lack of isolated examples for ""wif,"" ""zup,"" ""bluf,"" and ""walm"" prevents us from definitively stating the rule for these words.
Based on the given examples, each instance of ""wif"" results in the output ""red."" Therefore, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red. There's no evidence from the examples that ""wif"" has a dependency or relation to its position or surrounding words - it consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of its placement.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding outputs:

1. Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

2. Input: zup wif walm lug -> Output: yellow red red red blue
- ""zup"" again corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" again corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" is repeated three times, so it might correspond to ""red.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""

3. Input: lug zup dax wif -> Output: blue yellow green red
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""

4. Input: zup wif walm -> Output: yellow red red red
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""wif"" corresponds to ""red.""
- ""walm"" (repeated twice here) again seems to correspond to ""red.""

5. Input: zup lug dax -> Output: yellow blue green
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""

All occurrences of ""zup"" produce ""yellow"" in the output. The term ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" It appears ""walm"" is repeated as many times as it is included in the input, each repetition corresponding to ""red.""

Rule: zup -> yellow
Given the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" represents the color ""yellow."" However, looking at the outputs, the word ""bluf"" doesn't consistently translate to ""yellow""; instead, it seems to represent a different color based on the context. Here is what we can see from the inputs and outputs:

- When ""lug"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is blue.
- When ""wif"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is red.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""bluf"", the output is yellow.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf"" in the last example, the output is red. However, this example is less clear since there is an additional color ""green"" in the output that isn't directly preceded by another word, which may suggest the rules are a bit more complex.

It's possible that ""bluf"" is modified by the word that comes before it, with ""lug"" turning it blue, ""wif"" turning it red, and ""zup"" turning it yellow. However, because the examples given are not exhaustive and do not clearly define what should happen in every case, let's assume the simplest rule that matches the examples:

Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" changes depending on the word that immediately precedes it. ""Lug"" turns it to ""blue,"" ""wif"" turns it to ""red,"" and ""zup"" turns it to ""yellow."" The case with ""dax"" followed by ""bluf"" is unclear, as the input ""dax walm wif bluf"" leads to ""green green green red red,"" which doesn't provide a clear rule for how ""bluf"" should be translated after ""dax."" However, in the absence of further examples, it's not possible to determine the exact rule for ""dax"" followed by ""bluf.""
walm -> three instances of the color blue in a row.

Rule: The word ""walm"" represents the sequence ""blue blue blue"". Whenever ""walm"" appears in an input, it translates to ""blue"" repeated three times in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup dax
    ",Output: yellow green,yellow green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""dax"" consistently translates to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words surrounding it. Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""dax"" can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the given examples.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
Rule: bluf -> ""repetition of the color word that immediately follows it"" 

When bluf is followed by the color word ""zup"" (which translates to ""yellow""), the output is ""blue blue yellow,"" indicating that bluf means to repeat the following color, which in this example was blue. The same pattern is seen with other color words that follow bluf in the examples, resulting in the repetition of those colors too.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the previous word

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color associated with the previous word to be repeated a corresponding number of additional times following its first occurrence.

Examples to support this rule:
- ""lug walm"" produced ""blue blue blue,"" indicating that ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to repeat two more times (total of three occurrences of blue).
- ""dax zup walm wif"" led to ""green yellow yellow yellow red,"" showing that ""walm"" caused ""yellow"" to be repeated two more times after its initial appearance (total of three occurrences of yellow).
- ""dax lug walm zup wif"" resulted in ""green blue blue blue yellow red,"" where ""walm"" caused ""blue"" to appear three times in succession.
- ""dax walm"" had the outcome ""green green green,"" where ""walm"" caused ""green"" to repeat twice more (three greens in total).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each nonce word translates to a specific color name. ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in each example.
Based on the given examples, the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, the rule appears to be that the word ""dax"" corresponds directly to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" correlates to the output ""red."" In each case, whenever the input includes ""wif,"" the corresponding output includes ""red."" Therefore, it can be deduced that ""wif"" means ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Reviewing the given examples:

1. Input: zup dax bluf wif zup bluf lug
   Output: yellow green green red yellow yellow blue

2. Input: wif bluf
   Output: red red

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow

4. Input: zup lug bluf zup bluf wif
   Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow red

5. Input: wif zup dax bluf
   Output: red yellow green green

By examining the examples, the word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""green"" in the output.

Rule: bluf -> green
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" we can analyze the patterns of the input and output pairs to understand how ""walm"" influences the output.

In the first example:
- ""zup wif dax walm"" yields ""yellow red green green green.""
""zup"" seems to correspond to ""yellow,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""dax"" to ""green."" After ""walm,"" we only see ""green"" repeated.

In the second example:
- ""dax walm wif"" results in ""green green green red.""
Again, ""dax"" corresponds with ""green"" and ""wif"" with ""red."" ""walm"" precedes three ""green"" in the output.

In the third example:
- ""lug walm wif zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue red yellow red.""
Here, ""lug"" seems to correspond to ""blue,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to ""yellow."" Similar to previous examples, ""walm"" is followed by a triple ""blue.""

In the fourth example:
- ""wif zup bluf lug walm"" corresponds to ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue.""
The known pairings work, and again, ""walm"" is followed by a triple ""blue.""

In the fifth example:
- ""lug zup walm lug"" is transformed into ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""
Here, ""lug"" is ""blue,"" ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" and following ""walm,"" we see ""yellow"" repeated.

Considering the patterns, it seems ""walm"" acts as an instruction to repeat the output color that would correspond with the next word in the input sequence. Therefore, ""walm"" makes the word after it triple its occurrence in the output.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the next word's corresponding color three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" in all the given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""dax,"" we will look at where it appears and how the output changes in relation to other words.

Looking at the outputs, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green. This holds true regardless of the word's position in the input. Additionally, other words appear to correspond to different colors and it seems that the color does not change based on the position of the word either.

Here are the rules we can induce from the given examples:

- ""dax"" always corresponds to green.
- ""wif"" changes output color to red when followed after ""dax"" but is red itself otherwise.
- ""bluf"" is not in the input after ""dax,"" so its color remains unknown.
- ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, irrespective of its position.
- ""lug"" corresponds to blue.
- ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and corresponds to green; when it appears with ""lug"" before ""dax,"" the output is blue for ""lug"" and then the repeated sequence green green for ""dax walm.""

With the information provided, we can deduce that:

dax -> meaning. Rule: When ""dax"" is present in an input, the output is green.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""bluf"" seems to be translated to two colors in the output, and those colors correspond with the preceding word in the input.

Looking at the examples:

- In the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""wif"", the output is ""red red"".
- In the third example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", and when ""bluf"" follows ""dax"", the output is ""green green"".
- The fifth example has ""wif"" followed by ""bluf"" and then ""zup"" followed by ""bluf"". The output is ""red red"" after the first ""wif"" and ""yellow yellow"" after ""zup"".

So the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color of the word that immediately precedes it and duplicates the corresponding color in the output.

Rule: bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" is to duplicate the color associated with the preceding word in the output sequence.
To induce the rule for ""walm,"" we will analyze each example and its corresponding output:

1. ""zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""yellow yellow red red red""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow""
3. ""dax wif walm"" -> ""green red red red""
4. ""dax wif zup bluf wif walm"" -> ""green red yellow yellow red red red""
5. ""wif walm zup"" -> ""red red red yellow""

We can observe that for every occurrence of ""walm"" in the input, there are three ""red"" in the output:

1. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
2. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
3. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
4. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""
5. ""walm"" corresponds to ""red red red""

Additionally, it does not seem dependent on its position or surrounding words since in every instance, regardless of what precedes or follows ""walm,"" the triple ""red"" sequence is unchanged.

Rule: walm -> three successive instances of the color red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" directly translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" correlates to the color green. Additionally, we can infer that certain other words correspond to different colors:

- ""zup"" appears to correspond to yellow, as seen in the first and fourth examples.
- ""wif"" appears to correspond to red, as seen in the first and third examples.
- ""lug"" appears to correspond to blue, as seen in the second and third examples.
- ""walm"" seems to correspond to a repetition of blue, as seen in the second and fourth examples, where ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" and it results in consecutive blue outputs.

Let's lay out the rules derived from the examples:

Rule:
- ""dax"" -> green
- ""zup"" -> yellow
- ""wif"" -> red
- ""lug"" -> blue
- ""walm"" -> repeat the color of the word before it (if the preceding word is ""lug"", then ""walm"" gives blue, and if the preceding word is ""dax"", ""walm"" gives green).
Based on the provided examples, we can induce that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in each output sequence. The use of ""wif"" does not appear to be influenced by the context of the other words, as its output is consistently ""red"" regardless of the surrounding words (e.g., ""zup,"" ""dax,"" ""lug,"" ""bluf,"" ""walm""). Each of these surrounding words corresponds to a specific color: ""zup"" to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""bluf"" and ""walm"" potentially to ""blue"" as well since in all cases they precede the occurrence of ""wif,"" and their presence does not affect the output of ""red"" that follows ""wif.""

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we have to look for patterns in the given examples:

1. In the phrase ""lug zup,"" the output is ""blue yellow."" 
2. In the phrase ""wif dax zup wif,"" the output is ""red green yellow red."" 
3. In the phrase ""wif lug bluf zup bluf dax,"" the output is ""red blue blue yellow yellow green.""
4. In the phrase ""wif zup bluf lug walm,"" the output is ""red yellow yellow blue blue blue.""
5. In the phrase ""wif zup lug,"" the output is ""red yellow blue.""

We need to look for a pattern that only applies when ""zup"" is included in the input.

When looking at these examples, we can notice that ""zup"" seems to be associated with the word ""yellow."" It appears that each time ""zup"" is introduced, the color ""yellow"" is added into the output sequence. Another observation is that the color ""yellow"" always occurs in the position after where ""zup"" appears in the input.

Let's see if this pattern holds consistently:
- In the first example, ""zup"" is preceded by ""lug"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and the output after ""blue"" is ""yellow.""
- In the second example, ""zup"" is preceded by two words, ""wif"" and ""dax,"" which correspond to ""red"" and ""green,"" respectively, and the output after these colors is ""yellow.""
- In the third example, ""zup"" comes after ""bluf,"" which corresponds to ""blue,"" and once again, ""yellow"" follows in the output sequence.
- The fourth example seems to support this as well: ""zup"" follows ""wif,"" which translates to ""red,"" and is followed by ""yellow"" in the output.
- The fifth example also aligns with the pattern: ""zup"" comes after ""wif"" (""red""), and ""yellow"" follows in the output sequence.

Based on this pattern, we can deduce the following rule for ""zup"":

Rule: ""zup"" -> ""insert yellow after the color corresponding to the word that preceded 'zup'""
Rule: The word ""bluf"" results in the word ""green"" being printed the same number of times as the number immediately preceding ""bluf"" occurrences in the sequence.
Rule: The word ""walm"" correlates with the rule that the following word dictates the color to be repeated. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be three. This is evidenced by the fact that after ""walm"" appears, the color associated with the subsequent word is repeated three times.

Therefore:

- In the first example ""dax walm wif dax,"" ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, which is repeated three times before moving on to the next word ""dax"" which is green. 
- In the second example ""wif walm,"" without a word following ""walm,"" it defaults to three repetitions of the color associated with ""wif,"" which is red.
- In the third example ""dax walm zup lug walm,"" ""zup"" follows the first ""walm,"" leading to yellow being repeated three times, then ""lug"" is blue, and since there is no word after the second ""walm,"" blue is repeated three more times.
- In the fourth example ""dax walm wif bluf,"" the word ""wif"" follows ""walm,"" meaning red is repeated three times after which ""bluf"" is added once, colored red.
- In the fifth example ""dax lug walm,"" the word ""lug"" follows ""walm,"" which leads to blue being repeated three times.

walm -> meaning: Walm indicates that the color associated with the next word should be repeated three times. If there is no following word, the last color is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, we can infer the following:

- When the word ""dax"" appears in the input, ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- The other words seem to map consistently to certain colors as well. For instance, ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- ""bluf"" has only appeared twice and corresponded to ""red"" both times, so we can tentatively say that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red.""

Putting this together, it seems that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green
wif -> the color red, preceded by the colors represented by other nonce words in reverse order. 

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" is used, it translates to the color red. Additionally, the words preceding ""wif"" each correspond to a color, and those colors are listed in reverse order before listing the color red. 

Examples:
- ""zup wif"" translates to ""yellow red"" because ""zup"" means yellow.
- ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"" because ""dax"" means green, ""walm"" also means green, followed by three reds, which corresponds to the three words before ""wif"".
- ""lug dax walm wif"" translates to ""blue green green green red"" because ""lug"" means blue, ""dax"" means green, ""walm"" means green, followed by a single red.
- ""lug walm zup lug zup wif"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red"" because the colors are listed in reverse order before ""wif"": ""lug"" means blue, ""walm"" is disregarded as it does not appear directly before ""wif,"" ""zup"" means yellow, then ""lug"" means blue, followed by another appearance of ""zup"" meaning yellow, and finally, ""wif"" means red.
Based on the given examples, it appears that 'zup' consistently translates to the color 'yellow'. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

zup -> yellow

Rule: Whenever 'zup' is present in the input, it corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.
Rule: bluf -> red when immediately preceded or followed by wif, otherwise blue.
walm -> repetition of the color corresponding to the word that precedes it

Rule: When the word ""walm"" follows another word, it causes the color associated with that preceding word to be repeated thrice. If ""walm"" is followed by another color word, only the color preceding ""walm"" is repeated, and the next color word starts a new sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position within the input sentence.
From the given examples, it appears that ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Each time ""wif"" is mentioned in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the respective position in the output.

Therefore, the rule can be written as:

wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" in the output sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.

Thus, the rule can be written as:

zup -> meaning: ""yellow""
Rule: bluf -> the color of the preceding word.
walm -> repeat the color of the previous word. Rule: The number of times the color is repeated is equal to the number of letters in the preceding color word.

Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond with the color ""red"". Every time ""wif"" is present in the input, ""red"" is present in the output, regardless of its position or the other words it is paired with. Additionally, the first word before or after ""wif"" corresponds to a specific color: ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", and ""zup"" to ""yellow"". The word ""walm"" is not present in any example without ""wif"", but as it produces ""red red red"", it is likely that ""walm"" translates to a repetition of ""red"".

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> red
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that comes before it. In the first two examples, ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue,"" signifying that ""walm"" causes the word ""lug"" (blue) to be repeated three times. Extending this pattern to the other examples, when ""walm"" follows ""zup"" (yellow) in the third example, ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow,"" confirming that ""walm"" has the rule of tripling the preceding color word.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule as:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the preceding color word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax
    ",Output: green,green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"". Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output sequence.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

For each occurrence of ""wif,"" the output is ""red,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the presence of other words. Therefore, the rule can be inferred as:

Rule: wif -> red

Each time ""wif"" is present, it translates directly to ""red"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow."" No matter the context or the position of ""zup"" in the input, the output always includes ""yellow"" in the corresponding position. Therefore:

Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" corresponds to the word right before it being repeated once more in the output. Every time the word ""bluf"" appears, the word right before it is repeated. Therefore, ""bluf"" indicates that the previous word's color should be repeated.

Rule: bluf -> repeat the previous color.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let us examine the patterns:

1. Input: zup wif walm | Output: yellow red red red
    - ""walm"" in this context follows ""wif,"" and the output is ""red"" for each subsequent color.

2. Input: lug walm dax | Output: blue blue blue green
    - ""walm"" here follows ""lug,"" and the output is ""blue"" for each subsequent color until a new word (""dax"") changes the color.

3. Input: zup bluf lug zup walm | Output: yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow
    - ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" and the output is ""yellow"" for each color representation of ""zup.""

4. Input: wif walm dax | Output: red red red green
    - Again, ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" yielding ""red"" for each color representation of ""wif.""

Based on these inputs and outputs:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is yellow and remains yellow.
- When ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" the output is red and remains red.
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" the output is blue and remains blue until a new color word is introduced.

From these observations, it appears that ""walm"" causes replication of the previous color until a new color is introduced or the sequence ends.

Rule: walm -> causes replication of the previous color in the output until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif dax wif lug walm zup
    ",Output: red green red blue blue blue yellow,red green red blue blue blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the provided examples, ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the output ""blue"". Thus, the rule appears to be:

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: ""dax"" translates to the color green.
To deduce the meaning of ""wif,"" let's look at the given input and output pairs:

1. Input: wif
   Output: red

2. Input: dax wif walm lug zup walm
   Output: green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow

3. Input: zup wif
   Output: yellow red

4. Input: lug wif dax
   Output: blue red green

5. Input: wif walm
   Output: red red red

Analyzing the outputs corresponding to the instances of ""wif"" in the inputs, we can see that ""wif"" consistently results in the output ""red."" This is true regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. Furthermore, the non-wif words each translate to their unique color:

- dax -> green
- walm -> red (consistent with wif)
- lug -> blue
- zup -> yellow

Therefore, the rule for ""wif"" seems to be that it always translates to the color ""red,"" irrespective of context.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""zup"" is associated with the color ""yellow."" Each time ""zup"" is used in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the output. The words ""dax,"" ""lug,"" and ""wif"" correspond to the colors ""green,"" ""blue,"" and ""red,"" respectively. There seems to be a direct translation from these nonce words to specific colors.

Here's the observed pattern:
- ""dax"" -> ""green""
- ""lug"" -> ""blue""
- ""wif"" -> ""red""

And finally, the word in question:
- ""zup"" -> ""yellow""

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Rule: The meaning of ""bluf"" depends on the word that comes before it. If the preceding word is ""dax,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""lug,"" then ""bluf"" means ""blue."" If the preceding word is ""zup,"" then ""bluf"" means ""yellow."" If the preceding word is ""wif,"" then ""bluf"" means ""green."" It appears that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word before it unless it is after ""wif,"" in which case it defaults to green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the nonce word ""walm"" results in a series of three colors in the output. The series always starts with the color red and successively includes a color based on the word that precedes ""walm."" To determine the specific color associated with each preceding word, we can analyze the outputs given the corresponding inputs:

- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" the resulting series is ""red red red.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug,"" the resulting series is ""red blue blue blue.""
- When ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup,"" the resulting series is ""red yellow yellow yellow.""

From this, we can induce the rule for ""walm,"" considering the other words and how they affect the output:

- ""wif"" leads to the output ""red.""
- ""lug"" leads to the output ""blue blue blue.""
- ""zup"" leads to the output ""yellow yellow yellow.""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word three times, but always starts with ""red."" If ""walm"" itself is the first word, then it defaults to three reds.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the last color three times, beginning with ""red.""

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax zup wif
    ",Output: blue green yellow red,blue green yellow red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> meaning. The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the word ""blue"" across all examples provided.

Rule: lug means blue.
Based on the given examples, we can infer a rule for what ""dax"" signifies in the context of colors. Notice that every time ""dax"" appears in the input, the word ""green"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Rule: dax -> green.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""
zup -> yellow. Rule: Each time the word zup appears, it corresponds with the color yellow.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output color ""green."" In every example where ""bluf"" is present, the output includes the word ""green."" It does not seem to matter where ""bluf"" appears in the input sentence (beginning, middle, or end) or what the surrounding words are. Thus, the rule could be stated as:

bluf -> green

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""green"" appears in the output at the corresponding position.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm"" from the given examples, we need to analyze the patterns in the input and the corresponding output:

- Each time ""walm"" is used, the output seems to repeat the color associated with the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" the same number of times as there are letters in the word that comes after ""walm"".

Let's verify this:

1. In ""zup walm dax lug,"" ""walm"" is preceded by ""zup"" (associated with ""yellow"") and followed by ""dax"" (which has three letters). The output is ""yellow yellow yellow,"" which repeats ""yellow"" three times, followed by the color associated with ""dax"" and then ""lug"".

2. ""dax walm zup"" has ""walm"" preceded by ""dax"" (associated with ""green"") and followed by ""zup"" (which has three letters). The output is ""green green green yellow,"" which again repeats ""green"" three times and then ends with ""yellow"" for ""zup"".

3. For ""dax lug dax lug walm,"" ""walm"" comes after two ""dax lug"" sequences and is not followed by any word. The output is ""green blue green blue blue blue"". Here we see the color before ""walm"" is ""blue"" (associated with ""lug"") and it is repeated twice, which is consistent with the absence of a following word (possibly a default of two repetitions if there is no following word).

4. In ""wif walm,"" ""walm"" comes after ""wif"" (associated with ""red"") and is not followed by any word. The output is ""red red red,"" repeating ""red"" three times, suggesting that ""walm"" without a following word still defaults to three repetitions.

5. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" results in ""blue blue blue green red blue red"" and notes that ""walm"" is preceded by ""lug"" (associated with ""blue"") and followed by ""dax"" (with three letters). The output appropriately repeats ""blue"" thrice before continuing with the sequence.

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes ""walm"" as many times as the number of letters in the word that directly follows ""walm"". If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, repeat the preceding color thrice.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug dax
    ",Output: blue green,blue green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" can be inferred as meaning ""blue"". Each time the word ""lug"" is used in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"". 

Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

lug -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"".
Based on the presented examples, we can induce that the appearance of the word ""dax"" corresponds with a specific color in the output. Each instance of ""dax"" is directly followed by or associated with the color ""green"" in the output. Therefore, it seems that ""dax"" is consistently related to the color green, regardless of its position in the input sequence.

Rule:
dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the output pattern associated with the presence of the nonce word ""wif"" appears consistent in generating the output ""red."" Specifically, each occurrence of ""wif"" maps directly to a single instance of ""red"" in the output. Here is the pattern observed:

- The first and third examples show that a sole ""wif"" input results in a sole ""red"" output.
- The second example includes ""wif"" once, and the output includes ""red"" once, followed by patterns for ""bluf"" and ""dax walm.""
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" occurs after ""zup"" and ""bluf,"" which respectively map to ""yellow"" and another ""yellow,"" then ""wif"" translates to ""red,"" followed by ""walm,"" which produces two additional ""reds.""
- The fifth example shows two instances of ""wif"" separated by ""dax,"" leading to their respective ""red"" outputs, with ""dax"" producing ""green"" in between.

Therefore, we can deduce the rule:

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""zup"" appears to indicate that the following word (or words, since in some examples it affects multiple words) should be repeated once in the output. Analyzing the given input/output pairs:

- ""wif zup dax bluf"" leads to ""red yellow green green,"" which suggests ""zup"" caused ""green"" to be listed twice.
  
- ""zup walm"" results in ""yellow yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" made ""yellow"" appear two extra times.

- ""zup bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow yellow,"" where ""zup"" resulted in an additional ""yellow.""

- ""zup lug walm wif walm"" converts to ""yellow blue blue blue red red red,"" showing that ""zup"" caused ""blue"" and ""red"" to be repeated twice.

- ""zup wif"" turns into ""yellow red"" where ""zup"" did not cause a repetition; this might suggest that ""zup"" itself translates to ""yellow,"" seeing as ""wif"" on its own seems to output ""red.""

Taking this into account, the rule appears to be that ""zup"" translates into ""yellow"" and causes the color output of the following word(s) to be repeated once.

Rule: zup -> ""yellow"" and repeat the color output of the next word(s) once.
bluf -> The word ""bluf"" means that the output color will be the same as the color associated with the word that comes directly before ""bluf"". 

Rule: If a word X precedes ""bluf"", then the output for ""bluf"" is the same color corresponding to the word X.
walm -> meaning. Rule: ""walm"" appears to mean ""repeat the last color mentioned"". 

In each example, the word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

For example:
1. In ""zup lug walm wif dax"", zup is yellow, lug is blue, walm repeats the color blue, and then the pattern continues.
2. In ""dax walm"", dax is green and walm repeats the color green for each subsequent occurrence.
3. In ""wif lug zup walm wif lug"", the color just before walm is yellow and so walm corresponds to yellow.

Therefore, the general rule for the nonce word ""walm"" seems to be that it repeats the color value of the preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif
    ",Output: blue red,blue red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue, regardless of its position in the sequence.
Rule: dax -> green

- In the first example, ""dax"" outputs ""green"".
- In the second example, ""dax"" is again followed by ""green"".
- In the third example, despite the different ordering, ""dax"" still results in ""green"".
- In the fourth example, ""dax walm"" leads to ""green green"", but since ""walm"" appears with ""dax"" in example one and outputs ""red"", it seems ""dax"" is ensuring the output is ""green"" here.
- In the fifth example, ""dax lug wif"" outputs ""green blue red"", and since ""lug"" and ""wif"" have prior outputs of ""blue"" and ""red"", the use of ""dax"" in the first position appears to consistently result in ""green"".

This rule seems consistent across all examples provided.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red."" Each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to ""red"" in the output, regardless of the position of ""wif"" in the sequence. Here is the breakdown:

- ""wif"" in ""wif walm zup lug zup walm"" corresponds to the first ""red"" in the output, with additional ""red"" for the repeated use of ""wif.""
- ""wif"" in ""wif bluf"" and ""wif lug"" also corresponds to ""red,"" followed by another color based on the second word in each input.
- Lastly, ""wif"" in ""wif walm dax zup"" again corresponds to ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""bluf"" dictates that the output word's color is the same as the color corresponding to the word immediately preceding ""bluf"". Here is the pattern:

- In ""zup bluf,"" zup corresponds to yellow, and so the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf,"" dax corresponds to green, and so the output is ""green green.""

The rule is consistent across all provided examples. Therefore, we can deduce the following:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color corresponding to the word immediately before bluf.
By analyzing the examples provided, we can infer the following patterns:

Input: dax walm lug
Output: green green green blue
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"". ""walm"" appears immediately after ""dax"", and the output is ""green green green"", suggesting that ""walm"" also translates to ""green"" when following ""dax"".

Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
- Again, ""dax"" translates to ""green""; ""lug"" and the ""walm"" following it translates to ""blue"". ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", and ""bluf"" correspondingly results in ""red"", which does not give additional information about ""walm"" itself.

Input: wif bluf dax walm
Output: red red green green green
- ""wif"" and ""bluf"" translate to ""red"", and ""dax"" translates to ""green"". The ""walm"" that follows ""dax"" also translates to ""green"".

Input: dax walm wif walm zup
Output: green green green red red red yellow
- ""dax"" translates to ""green"", and the ""walm"" that follows it translates to ""green"" as well. ""wif"" translates to ""red"", and the ""walm"" that follows ""wif"" translates to ""red"" as well. ""zup"" translates to ""yellow"", but it is not followed by ""walm"", so it offers no further insights into the meaning of ""walm"".

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and the ""walm"" that follows it also translates to ""blue"".

Putting these examples together, we can induce that ""walm"" translates to the same color as the word that immediately precedes it. Therefore, we can infer the following rule:

Rule:
walm -> The word ""walm"" means the color corresponding to the preceding word in the list.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Given the examples provided, ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in the output. Therefore, we can deduce the following rule:

dax -> green

Rule: The nonce word ""dax"" means the color green.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" consistently corresponds to the output ""red."" Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""wif"" appears to be as follows:

Rule: wif -> red.
Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"". Each instance of ""zup"" in the input corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output.
Rule: ""bluf"" means ""red"".
Based on the examples provided, the word ""walm"" seems to be connected to a pattern of repeating the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. In each output, the presence of ""walm"" leads to a repetition of the color that is linked to the word before ""walm.""

Here is how ""walm"" works in each example:

1. lug walm wif bluf -> blue blue blue red red
""lug"" leads to the output ""blue,"" which is then repeated twice because ""walm"" follows ""lug.""

2. dax wif walm lug zup -> green red red red blue yellow
""wif"" leads to ""red,"" which is then repeated twice because ""walm"" follows ""wif.""

3. lug wif lug walm zup walm wif -> blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red
Here ""lug"" leads to ""blue,"" which is then repeated twice because ""walm"" follows ""lug."" Similarly, ""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" which is repeated twice when ""walm"" follows.

4. lug walm -> blue blue blue
""lug"" results in ""blue,"" which is repeated twice due to ""walm.""

5. zup walm dax zup dax wif -> yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red
""zup"" leads to ""yellow,"" which is then repeated twice because ""walm"" follows ""zup.""

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" appears after a word, it causes the color associated with the preceding word to be repeated three times in total.

Rule: bluf -> the color that corresponds to the word immediately preceding it.
Rule: walm -> repeat the color of the previous word.

In each instance, the color associated with the word before ""walm"" is repeated for ""walm"". For example, in the first input, ""zup"" is associated with yellow, and ""walm"" that follows repeats ""yellow"" three times. Similarly, ""lug"" is associated with blue, and ""walm"" following it repeats ""blue"" three times. Thus, ""walm"" takes the color of the preceding word and repeats it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. 

Rule: Each instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color blue in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""dax,"" let's examine the examples:

1. Input: dax lug wif | Output: green blue red
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"".

2. Input: dax walm wif dax | Output: green green green red green
   - Repeated ""dax"" instances correspond to repeated ""green,"" and ""walm"" also corresponds to ""green,"" while ""wif"" consistently corresponds to ""red"".

3. Input: dax | Output: green
   - A single ""dax"" maps to ""green.""

4. Input: dax | Output: green
   - A single ""dax"" again maps to ""green.""

5. Input: zup lug dax | Output: yellow blue green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and ""dax"" to ""green.""

Given these examples, we can deduce that ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the nonce word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, the output includes the color ""red"" in the corresponding position. The rule appears consistent regardless of the position of ""wif"" within the input sequence.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of ""zup,"" let's compare the examples given. One way to approach this is to find where ""zup"" appears and what color it corresponds to in the output.

1. zup -> yellow
2. zup -> yellow
3. zup -> yellow
4. zup -> yellow
5. zup -> yellow

In all given examples, regardless of the position of ""zup"" in the input sequence, it corresponds to ""yellow"" in the output sequence. It seems that the position or the surrounding words have no effect on the translation of ""zup."" Therefore, we can conclude that the meaning of ""zup"" is consistent across all examples.

Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> meaning. Meaning can be a word or a general rule dependent on the context. Rule:

The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" This can be deduced from the constant presence of the word ""bluf"" and the corresponding color ""blue"" in the output across all given examples. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, ""blue"" follows in the output.
Analyzing the pattern from the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color that follows the most recent color word. The repetition continues until a new color word is mentioned, or ""walm"" ends the input.

For instance:

1. ""lug dax zup dax walm wif"" translates to ""red blue green green."" After encountering ""walm,"" the word ""green"" is repeated until ""wif"" (which corresponds to ""red"") changes the color.

2. ""zup wif walm lug"" becomes ""yellow red red,"" where ""red"" is repeated after ""walm,"" until ""lug"" introduces a new color, ""blue.""

3. ""dax walm"" results in ""green"" being repeated with ""walm,"" hence ""green green green.""

4. ""lug bluf dax lug zup walm lug"" translates to ""blue blue green blue yellow."" After ""walm,"" ""yellow"" repeats until ""lug"" changes the color to ""blue.""

5. ""zup walm wif"" follows this pattern by repeating ""yellow"" after ""walm"" until the end, as there is no new color to change to.

Rule: walm -> Repetition of the most recent color word until a new color word appears or the input ends.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> three repetitions of the color ""green.""
Given the examples provided, it appears that each unique word corresponds to a unique color:

- lug -> blue
- dax -> green
- zup -> yellow
- wif -> red
- walm -> red
- bluf -> yellow

However, seeing that both 'wif' and 'walm' output 'red' causes a bit of confusion because, in the given examples, no other word translates to more than one color.

To deduce the meaning of ""wif"" specifically, we can look for patterns where ""wif"" is used:

1. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""
2. ""dax wif walm lug zup walm"" -> ""green red red red blue yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""wif zup"" -> ""red yellow""
4. ""zup bluf wif lug dax"" -> ""yellow yellow red blue green""
5. ""wif lug"" -> ""red blue""

In examples 1, 3, and 5, ""wif"" directly precedes another word and translates to ""red"" in the output. In example 4, ""wif"" also translates to ""red"" even though it's not the first word in the sequence.

Considering the examples provided, the rule that can be deduced is:

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red.""
zup -> meaning. 

Based on the given examples, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"".
Based on the examples provided, the output for the nonce word ""bluf"" consistently corresponds to the word ""red"". Therefore, it seems that the word ""bluf"" translates to ""red"".

Rule: bluf -> red
walm -> repeat the color associated with the previous word three times.

Rule: Given a word that precedes 'walm', the output is the color corresponding to that word repeated three times. For example, 'dax' corresponds to green, so 'dax walm' outputs 'green green green'. Likewise, 'lug' corresponds to blue, so 'lug walm' outputs 'blue blue blue'.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of context within these examples.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" corresponds to the output ""yellow."" To verify this, we can examine each instance where ""bluf"" appears and determine if ""yellow"" is consistently the output. In every case above, ""bluf"" coincides with ""yellow"" in the output, irrespective of the words that appear before or after it.

Therefore, the deduced rule is:

bluf -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it seems that ""walm"" is associated with a sequence of colors repeated three times except when followed by the word ""zup,"" after which a different color, ""yellow,"" is produced. Let's analyze the pattern:

1. In the first example, ""lug walm zup lug walm,"" the sequence is blue thrice, then yellow, followed by blue thrice again.
2. In the second example, ""dax zup dax walm,"" we see green twice, then yellow, followed by green three times, suggesting that ""walm"" represents three of the preceding color. Since ""zup"" comes right before ""walm,"" it results in yellow.
3. The third example, ""lug walm zup wif,"" results in blue three times, then yellow, and finally red. It follows the pattern of triplet repetition before ""zup"" and the change to yellow after ""zup.""
4. When no ""zup"" is present, as seen in ""wif walm,"" the color red is repeated three times.
5. In the fifth example, ""lug walm wif lug bluf,"" there is no ""zup"" after ""walm,"" so the sequence is blue three times, then red, followed by blue twice (assuming ""bluf"" leads to a single ""blue"").

Here is the rule:
walm -> The word ""walm"" causes the immediately preceding color to be repeated three times unless followed by the word ""zup,"" in which case it produces ""yellow."" If ""walm"" follows another repeated color word, it maintains the threefold repetition pattern.

Rule: If the word before ""walm"" is a color, repeat that color three times (or continue the repeating pattern if already established). If ""walm"" is followed by ""zup,"" output ""yellow"" instead. If ""walm"" follows a repeated color word and is not followed by ""zup,"" continue the pattern of the repeated color without interruption.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> repeat the previously mentioned color.

Rule: When 'lug' appears in a sequence, it indicates that the color corresponding to the word immediately before 'lug' should be repeated until a new color word is encountered or the sequence ends.
Based on the provided examples, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" is followed by the word it's paired with repeated three times in the output, and each of these repetitions is translated into a different color. Here's how we can figure it out:

- In the first example, ""bluf dax lug"" translates to ""red green blue"". Since ""bluf"" translates to ""red"" and ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", it appears that ""dax"" inserted between them results in ""green"".

- In the third example, ""dax walm wif walm"" translates to ""green green green red red red"". We already know that ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"", so here ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" results in ""walm"" being repeated three times as ""green"".

- In the fifth example, ""dax walm"" simply translates to ""green green green"", with ""dax"" followed by ""walm"" again causing ""walm"" to be translated three times as ""green"".

Given these examples, it's reasonable to deduce the following rule for the nonce word ""dax"":

dax -> Causes the following word to be repeated three times in the output, each repetition translated into the color ""green"".

Rule: When ""dax"" is followed by a word, that word is repeated three times and each instance is assigned the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the meaning of ""wif"" can be determined as follows:

Input: wif dax
Output: red green
- The word ""wif"" is followed by the word ""dax,"" introducing the colors ""red green"" in the output.

Input: zup wif
Output: yellow red
- The word ""zup"" precedes ""wif,"" introducing the colors ""yellow red"" in the output, of which ""red"" appears after ""wif.""

Input: wif
Output: red
- The word ""wif"" on its own introduces the color ""red.""

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green
- The sequence ""dax bluf wif zup dax"" includes ""wif,"" which introduces ""red"" after ""bluf"" and before ""zup.""

Input: zup dax zup dax wif bluf
Output: yellow green yellow green red red
- The sequence ""zup dax zup dax wif bluf"" includes ""wif,"" which introduces ""red"" and is directly followed by another ""red"" due to ""bluf.""

The rule for ""wif"" seems consistent with the introduction of the color ""red"" in the output, despite the differing inputs.

Rule: wif -> introduces the color ""red"" in the output sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

This can be deduced from each input-output pair, where everytime the word ""zup"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the rule for the word ""bluf"" appears to be that it repeats the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here's how the rule applies to the examples given:

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, so ""bluf"" repeats that color: yellow yellow.
- In ""lug dax bluf,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" repeats green: green green green.
- In ""zup bluf lug,"" ""zup"" corresponds to yellow and ""lug"" to blue, so ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""zup"": yellow yellow blue.
- In ""dax bluf wif lug zup,"" ""dax"" corresponds to green, so ""bluf"" repeats that before moving on to the other colors: green green red blue yellow.
- In ""lug bluf dax lug,"" ""lug"" corresponds to blue and ""dax"" subsequently to green; ""bluf"" repeats the color of ""lug"": blue blue green blue.

Therefore, the rule is:
bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to colors repeating themselves in order based on the word that immediately precedes it. Here's the pattern from each input/output example:

1. dax walm zup lug -> green green green (The color green repeats based on the preceding word 'dax' which corresponds to green.)
2. lug wif dax walm zup -> green green (The color green repeats based on the preceding word 'dax' which corresponds to green.)
3. lug zup walm lug -> yellow yellow (The color yellow repeats based on the preceding word 'zup' which corresponds to yellow.)
4. dax wif walm -> red red (The color red repeats based on the preceding word 'wif' which corresponds to red.)
5. zup walm wif -> yellow yellow (The color yellow repeats based on the preceding word 'zup' which corresponds to yellow.)

So, the rule seems to be that ""walm"" causes the color represented by the previous word to repeat multiple times.

Rule: walm -> Causes the previous word's corresponding color to repeat.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: zup
    ",Output: yellow,yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning or rule for the nonce word ""lug,"" let's examine the correspondence between the input and the output in each example.

Here are the instances where ""lug"" appears and the corresponding colors:

1. dax lug -> green blue
2. dax zup wif bluf lug -> green yellow red red blue
3. wif lug bluf wif zup -> red blue blue red yellow
4. zup wif lug dax -> yellow red blue green
5. lug zup walm lug -> blue yellow yellow yellow blue

From the information provided, the occurrences of ""lug"" consistently translate to the color blue in the output.

Now, let's determine if ""lug"" only maps to blue or if there are any other rules at play. When ""lug"" appears twice in the same input (example 5), it still translates to blue both times, suggesting that the meaning of ""lug"" is independent of its position or repetition.

Considering all the above observations, the rule for ""lug"" is:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green.

The rule induction suggests that the word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence of words.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Rule: zup -> yellow

The output for ""zup"" in every example consistently corresponds to the word ""yellow."" There is no example where ""zup"" leads to a different output, suggesting that the rule is that the word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> double the color associated with the previous word. Rule:

The word ""bluf"" seems to cause the output to repeat the color associated with the word that came immediately before it twice.

- In ""zup bluf,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and after ""bluf"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- In ""wif bluf,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and after ""bluf"" the output is ""red red.""
- In various other examples, regardless of the word that precedes ""bluf"" (whether it's ""zup,"" ""wif,"" or ""dax""), the color associated with that word is repeated twice consecutively after ""bluf"" is mentioned. 

Therefore, the rule seems to be: Repeat the color of the word before ""bluf"" two times.
Based on the given examples, it seems that ""walm"" is a rule that multiplies or extends the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. To deduce this, I'll break down the examples:

1. wif dax lug walm -> red green blue blue blue
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, resulting in three blue outputs.

2. dax walm -> green green green
   ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" which corresponds to green, resulting in three green outputs.

3. lug wif zup wif walm -> blue red yellow red red red
   ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" which corresponds to red, resulting in three red outputs.

4. dax walm zup lug walm -> green green green yellow blue blue blue
   The first ""walm"" follows ""dax"" (green), and the second ""walm"" follows ""lug"" (blue), leading to the repetition of these colors.

5. dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax -> green blue blue blue green red red green
   ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" which corresponds to blue, resulting in three blue outputs before the sequence continues.

Rule: walm -> When ""walm"" follows a word, it repeats the output color associated with the word that immediately precedes it three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif
    ",Output: red,red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding word in the output is ""blue"".
dax -> green. Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" has a consistent translation in the outputs to a specific color. Each time ""wif"" is present in the input, the corresponding output color is ""red"". This relationship is consistent and does not appear to change with context or position in the sequence. Therefore, the rule deduced from the examples is:

wif -> red

Rule: Whenever ""wif"" is present in the input, the output color associated with it is ""red"".
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color yellow.
bluf -> meaning. Meaning is ""yellow"" as observed from the consistent replacement of ""bluf"" with ""yellow"" in the output. Rule: When ""bluf"" is present in the input, it translates to ""yellow"" in the output.
Considering the provided examples, it seems that the presence of the word ""walm"" before another word changes the color output of the following word to ""green,"" except when it is followed by the word ""wif,"" which then results in ""red.""

Here's a breakdown of the examples to illustrate the rule:

- In examples 1, 4, and 5, every word following ""walm"" has its output changed to ""green,"" except for ""wif,"" which changes to ""red.""
Example 1: ""dax walm wif zup"" => green green green red yellow
Example 4: ""dax walm wif bluf"" => green green green red red
Example 5: ""zup walm dax zup dax wif"" => yellow yellow yellow green yellow green red

- Examples 2 and 3 do not include a word after ""wif"" to test this part of the rule, but they confirm that ""wif"" after ""walm"" outputs ""red.""
Example 2: ""zup walm wif"" => yellow yellow yellow red
Example 3: ""zup wif walm"" => yellow red red red

Considering these observations, the rule for ""walm"" seems to be that it changes the color output of the following word to ""green,"" unless that word is ""wif,"" in which case the color output is ""red.""

Rule: walm -> Changes the color output of the following word to green, unless the following word is ""wif,"" which results in red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""lug"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""blue"".
Based on the given examples, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""dax"":

Whenever the word ""dax"" is present in the input, all the words prior to ""dax"" repeat their corresponding output color in the sequence that follows ""dax"". The word ""dax"" itself corresponds to the color green every time it appears.

Breaking down the inputs and outputs to see the pattern:

Input: wif walm dax zup wif lug walm
Output: red red red green yellow red blue blue blue
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" corresponds to blue, ""dax"" triggers the repetition of these colors and corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to red. After ""dax"", the colors red and blue are repeated.

Input: dax walm zup lug dax
Output: green green green yellow blue green
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""walm"" to green (since it comes after dax and follows the input sequence pattern), ""zup"" to yellow, and ""lug"" to blue. Another ""dax"" is green again and triggers repetition, but there are no words after it to apply the pattern to.

Input: wif walm dax
Output: red red red green
Rule: ""wif"" corresponds to red, ""walm"" to red, ""dax"" to green.

Input: dax
Output: green
Rule: ""dax"" alone corresponds to green.

Input: dax zup lug wif zup
Output: green yellow blue red yellow
Rule: ""dax"" corresponds to green, ""zup"" to yellow following ""dax"", ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. The second ""zup"" repetition also corresponds to yellow following the pattern after ""dax"".

From the pattern observed, ""dax"" causes the reset of the output sequence to repeat the color assignments based on the sequence of words before ""dax"". However, when ""dax"" stands alone or is at the beginning, it corresponds to green without influencing the pattern of any subsequent words.

dax -> green (with the additional rule that it causes the repetition of the color sequence from the beginning of the input after it).
wif -> meaning. From analyzing the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red."" 

Rule: Whenever the nonce word ""wif"" is encountered, it corresponds to the color ""red.""
Rule: zup -> yellow

Each instance of the word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's take a look at each pair of input and output to identify a pattern.

1. Input: dax zup lug zup bluf
   Output: green yellow blue yellow yellow

2. Input: zup bluf dax
   Output: yellow yellow green

3. Input: wif dax zup wif dax bluf
   Output: red green yellow red green green

4. Input: lug bluf
   Output: blue blue

5. Input: dax lug wif bluf
   Output: green blue red red

Examining the outputs where ""bluf"" appears, we note that the color which is repeated twice in a row corresponds to the earlier color output:

1. ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow"" which is the same color as the preceding word (""zup"" which outputs ""yellow"")

2. ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""yellow,"" matching the same color as the preceding word (""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" again)

3. ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""green,"" which matches the color of the preceding word (""dax"" outputs ""green"")

4. ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""blue,"" again matching the color of the preceding word (""lug"" outputs ""blue"")

5. ""bluf"" corresponds to the second ""red,"" matching the color of the preceding word (""wif"" outputs ""red"")

From these observations, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" corresponds to the same color as the preceding word, outputting it a second time. Therefore, the meaning of ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning: ""Repeat the color outputted by the immediately preceding word.""

Rule: If the preceding word corresponds to a color output, then ""bluf"" outputs the same color again.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's look at the relationship between the inputs and their outputs:

1. ""lug walm zup walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow""
2. ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow""
3. ""dax walm zup lug walm"" translates to ""green green green yellow blue blue blue""
4. ""lug walm zup"" translates to ""blue blue blue yellow""
5. ""dax zup walm wif walm"" translates to ""green yellow yellow yellow red red red""

Observations:
- The word ""walm"" is always followed by a color repeated three times.
- The color that follows ""walm"" seems to depend on the word that precedes ""walm"". 
- ""lug walm"" translates to ""blue blue blue"".
- ""zup walm"" translates to ""yellow yellow yellow"".
- ""dax walm"" translates to ""green green green"".
- ""wif walm"" translates to ""red red red"".

Rule:
Based on the given examples, ""walm"" is a rule that generates a color repeated three times, with the specific color being determined by the word that precedes ""walm.""

walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue. Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all given examples, regardless of its position in the sequence or the surrounding words.
dax -> meaning. From the examples provided, it's consistent that every time the input contains the word ""dax"" by itself, the output is ""green"". Therefore:

Rule: dax means green.
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce that the nonce word ""wif"" consistently correlates with the color ""red."" Other words in the examples also correlate with colors, such as ""lug"" with blue, ""zup"" with yellow, and ""dax"" with green. 

Therefore, the rule is: wif -> red.
Observing the examples given and the corresponding outputs, we can attempt to deduce the meaning of the word ""zup"" by identifying patterns and correlations.

- In the first example, 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow', as shown in the sequence ""dax wif zup dax"" which translates to ""green red yellow green"".
- In the second example, ""zup"" is still translated to ""yellow"" as indicated in the ""zup wif walm"" translating to ""yellow red red red"".
- Similarly, in the third, fourth, and fifth examples, 'zup' continues to correspond to 'yellow' in each of the given contexts.

Considering these examples, the rule that emerges is that the word ""zup"" consistently corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the surrounding words.

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" seems to consistently map to the output that matches the color of the word preceding it.

Examples:
- In ""wif bluf"" the output is ""red red,"" so ""bluf"" means ""red"" because the preceding word ""wif"" maps to ""red.""
- In ""zup bluf,"" the output is ""yellow red."" Here, ""bluf"" takes on the meaning of ""red"" again because the preceding word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- In ""dax bluf lug wif,"" we see ""bluf"" corresponds to ""green"" following the word ""dax,"" which maps to ""green.""

Rule: bluf -> takes the color of the preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's correlate the inputs with their outputs:

1. Input: wif walm zup
   Output: red red red yellow
   
2. Input: zup walm
   Output: yellow yellow yellow
   
3. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   
4. Input: lug bluf wif lug wif walm lug
   Output: blue blue red blue red red red blue
   
5. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue

From the examples, it seems that each word (excluding ""walm"") maps to a specific color in the output. For instance, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""zup"" maps to ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" maps to ""blue.""

Now, observing the use of ""walm"":

In examples 1, 2, and 3, the color that appears immediately after ""walm"" is the same color that appears immediately before it:
1. ""wif walm"" correlates with ""red red.""
2. ""zup walm"" correlates with ""yellow yellow.""
3. ""lug zup walm lug"" correlates with ""blue yellow yellow yellow blue.""

However, in example 4, ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" and is followed by ""lug,"" which seems to break this pattern. But, seeing the output ""red red red blue"" suggests that ""walm"" not only repeats the color of the preceding word but also has the ability to extend the sequence before an interruption by a different word (""lug"").

In example 5, ""walm"" follows ""lug wif zup bluf lug,"" which translates to ""blue red yellow yellow blue,"" and then is followed by ""dax lug,"" which translates to ""green blue."" Here, ""dax"" is the only word not previously seen, correlating to the new color ""green"". ""Walm"" sits between two sets of blue and does not seem to disrupt the pattern since the output sequence has consecutive ""blue blue.""

Based on these observations, ""walm"" appears to repeat the output color of the word immediately preceding it. With the provided data, it seems to extend a sequence of the same color in the output until a new different word (and thus a new color) appears.

Rule: walm -> repeats the output color of the immediately preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can see a pattern of the word ""lug"" consistently outputting ""blue"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the other words present. When ""lug"" appears, the output invariably contains the word ""blue"". The repetition of the output ""blue"" in response to the input ""lug"" indicates that ""lug"" translates directly to the color ""blue"".

Rule: lug -> blue
Based on the examples provided, it appears that ""dax"" corresponds to the output ""green."" Whenever dax is present in the input, ""green"" appears in the output. The rule doesn't seem to change with the presence of other words because dax always results in green, no matter the position in the sequence or the surrounding words.

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the provided examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" always corresponds to the output ""red."" There doesn't seem to be a dependency on the context or position of the word ""wif"" in the input sentence. Regardless of placement or the other words present, ""wif"" consistently results in ""red.""

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, we can see that ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Therefore, the induction for the meaning of ""zup"" is:

zup -> meaning. Meaning: yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" always corresponds to the color ""yellow.""
bluf -> meaning. Meaning appears to be ""repeat the color associated with the word immediately preceding bluf."" Rule: When bluf is used, output the color corresponding to the word before it twice.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color word that immediately precedes it. In each example, when ""walm"" appears, it repeats the color that the preceding word represents.

Here's the breakdown of how ""walm"" functions in each input:

- In the first example, ""lug"" is translated to blue, and ""walm"" follows, resulting in three additional ""blue"" outputs.
- In the second example, ""dax"" is translated to green, and when ""walm"" follows, it results in two additional ""green"" outputs before the pattern is interrupted by another color word.
- In the third example, ""dax"" is translated to green, and ""walm"" repeats this output three times.
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is translated to red, and ""walm"" repeats this output three times before continuing with the next color word translations.
- In the last example, ""zup"" is translated to yellow, and ""walm"" repeats this output two times.

Rule: walm -> Repeats the color output of the immediately preceding word.

It appears that each unique word translates to a specific color, and the colors always maintain the same order regardless of the position of the words in the Input.

Thus, the rule is: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Based on the examples provided, the word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"". The word ""wif"" is then followed by the color ""red"", ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", and ""dax"" is ""green"". The pattern of input to output is one to one for each word to its respective color.

Rule: Each nonce word corresponds to a specific color. ""zup"" means yellow, ""wif"" means red, ""lug"" means blue, and ""dax"" means green.
Rule: bluf -> red
Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" seems to repeat the color of the word that directly follows it. If ""lug"" follows ""walm"", the color blue is repeated. If ""wif"" follows ""walm"", the color red is repeated. If ""dax"" follows ""walm"", the color green is repeated regardless of the color that appeared before ""walm"". If no word follows ""walm"", there are no additional outputs.

walm -> meaning: ""walm"" prompts the repetition of the color of the word that directly follows it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug wif dax walm
    ",Output: blue red green green green,blue red green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue.""
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""dax,"" we need to identify patterns in the inputs and outputs. A direct way to do this is to isolate the instances of the word ""dax"" from the inputs and examine the corresponding outputs.

In every instance where ""dax"" appears, the output is ""green."" There are no other words in the input that translate to ""green"" in the output, and ""dax"" consistently results in ""green,"" regardless of its position in the sequence. This indicates that ""dax"" has a one-to-one correspondence with the color ""green.""

dax -> meaning. Rule:
dax means green.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""wif"" correlates to the color ""red"". Each time ""wif"" appears in the input, ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a specific color in the output. Whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. Thus, we can deduce the following rule:

bluf -> red

This suggests that ""bluf"" is a nonce word for the color red.
walm -> yellow

Rule: Walm corresponds to the color yellow in the outputs provided. Each instance where ""walm"" is present in the input, the word ""yellow"" is represented in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug
    ",Output: red blue,red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, we can deduce the following pattern:

1. Whenever the word ""lug"" appears, the word ""blue"" is in the corresponding position in the Output.
2. ""lug"" does not seem to depend on its position in the Input sequence as it can be at the beginning, middle, or end.

Given this information, we can induce the following rule:

lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
dax -> meaning: green. Rule: Whenever the word dax appears in the input, the output is green.
Based on the given examples, the rule seems to be that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the word ""red."" Here is the logic:

- ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red,"" where all words except ""wif"" have a one-to-one color association (dax -> green, lug -> blue, bluf -> red). Hence, ""wif"" must also translate to red.
  
- ""dax walm wif bluf"" becomes ""green green green red red,"" where ""dax"" is green, and ""bluf"" is red. ""Walm"" is repeated thrice and linked to green each time, so it likely means ""green."" This leaves ""wif"" meaning red once again.

- ""wif zup"" translates to ""red yellow,"" and since ""wif"" is the only term associated with red in all examples, it should mean red, and ""zup"" means yellow.

- ""wif zup dax"" becomes ""red yellow green,"" which further confirms the assignment of red to ""wif,"" yellow to ""zup,"" and green to ""dax.""

- ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif"" translates to ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red,"" again reconfirming the pattern of ""lug"" for blue, ""zup"" for yellow, ""walm"" for blue, and ""wif"" for red.

Rule: wif -> red
Based on the provided examples, zup seems to consistently correspond to the color yellow, regardless of its position in the sequence or the words that surround it. In every instance given, the presence of the word zup in the input is directly translated to the color yellow in the output.

Rule: zup -> yellow
Bluf -> blue

Rule: Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears in the input, it corresponds to the word ""blue"" in the output.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's look closely at each input where it appears and the corresponding output.

1. Input: lug walm zup lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue yellow blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""
   - ""zup"" results in ""yellow""

2. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

3. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""bluf"" does not seem to have a direct output, suggesting context sensitivity or that it modifies something else.
   - ""lug walm"" results in ""blue blue blue""

4. Input: dax walm
   Output: green green green
   - ""dax walm"" results in ""green green green""

5. Input: zup lug walm wif dax
   Output: yellow blue blue blue red green
   - ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow""
   - ""lug walm"" corresponds to ""blue blue blue""
   - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""
   - ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given these examples, it seems apparent that ""walm"" is a modifier that dictates color repetition. When paired with ""lug,"" the color ""blue"" is output three times. When paired with ""dax,"" the color ""green"" is output three times. There aren't examples with ""walm"" paired with ""wif"" or ""zup"" for direct comparison, but based on the examples given, it seems likely that it might repeat their associated colors three times as well.

Hence, the rule appears to be:
Rule: walm -> When placed after another word, it causes the color associated with that word to be repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax walm
    ",Output: green green green,green green green,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word 'lug' consistently corresponds to the color 'blue' in the output. There are repeated instances where 'lug' is directly translated to 'blue' without any noticeable variation depending on the context or adjacent words.

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: Based on the input-output examples provided, every time the word 'dax' appears in an input, the color 'green' appears in the corresponding output. Therefore, 'dax' translates to the color 'green.'
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the sequence. Any time ""wif"" appears, the output is ""red"". Additional words such as ""dax,"" ""walm,"" ""lug,"" and ""zup"" correspond to other colors (""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> red, ""lug"" -> blue, ""zup"" -> yellow).
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, it appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to the color associated with the word that precedes it. Here is the observed pattern:

- When ""dax"" precedes ""bluf,"" the output is ""red.""
- With ""zup"" before ""bluf,"" the output is ""yellow.""
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf,"" the output is ""blue.""

In the case of ""zup dax bluf,"" ""bluf"" takes the color associated with ""dax"" since it is the word immediately preceding ""bluf.""

So, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" translates to the color associated with the word right before it.

Rule: bluf -> takes on the color associated with the word that comes immediately before it.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it, repeated three times. Here's the breakdown:

- zup lug walm: ""zup"" corresponds to yellow, ""lug"" to blue, and ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
- dax walm: ""dax"" corresponds to green, and ""walm"" repeats green three times.
- lug walm zup lug zup wif: in the sequence ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" equates to blue, so ""walm"" repeats blue three times.
- zup wif walm: in the sequence ""wif walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to red, so ""walm"" repeats red three times.
- lug dax walm: in the sequence ""dax walm,"" ""dax"" is green, so ""walm"" repeats green three times.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""walm"" is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug
    ",Output: blue,blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue

Based on the examples provided, every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds directly to the output of the color ""blue."" Regardless of the position or the presence of other words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue"" in the outputs.
dax -> green. 

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color green in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, regardless of its position in the sequence or the presence of other words.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates directly to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
The word ""bluf"" maps to a color, but it's not a direct one-to-one mapping with a single color every time. Instead, ""bluf"" translates to the color of the word immediately preceding it. Let's check this against each example:

In the first example, ""bluf"" follows ""lug"" and ""zup."" Lug translates to blue, and so the first ""bluf"" translates to blue. Zup translates to yellow, so the second ""bluf"" also translates to yellow, matching the colors of the words they follow.

In the second example, ""bluf"" follows ""dax,"" which translates to green, so ""bluf"" also translates to green.

The third example is just ""dax bluf,"" and since ""dax"" translates to green, ""bluf"" also translates to green.

In the fourth example, ""bluf"" follows ""wif"" and ""dax."" Wif translates to red, so the ""bluf"" that follows it translates to red. Dax translates to green, so the final word in the sequence ""dax"" also translates to green, which matches the previous word ""bluf.""

The fifth example is ""wif bluf,"" where ""wif"" translates to red, and so ""bluf"" also translates to red.

The rule seems consistent across all examples provided:
Rule: bluf -> translates to the color of the immediately preceding word.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" let's examine the color outputs in the presence of the word ""walm"" and compare them to the context in which it does not appear.

When we look at the inputs and outputs, we notice that:

1. ""zup wif walm"" outputs ""yellow red red red."" Without ""walm"", ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
2. ""lug wif dax walm zup"" outputs ""blue red green green green yellow."" Without ""walm"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", ""wif"" outputs ""red"", ""dax"" outputs ""green"", and ""zup"" outputs ""yellow.""
3. ""zup bluf wif walm"" outputs ""yellow yellow red red red."" Without ""walm"", ""zup"" outputs ""yellow"", ""bluf"" has not been demonstrated to output anything on its own, and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""
4. ""lug walm dax"" outputs ""blue blue blue green."" Without ""walm"", ""lug"" outputs ""blue"", and ""dax"" outputs ""green.""
5. ""lug walm wif"" outputs ""blue blue blue red."" We know that ""lug"" outputs ""blue"" and ""wif"" outputs ""red.""

From the above, we can see that ""walm"" seems to change the output pattern by causing the color of the word immediately preceding ""walm"" to repeat until a new color word is mentioned. For example, in ""lug walm dax,"" the color blue corresponding to ""lug"" repeats until ""dax"" changes the color output to green. This repetition always happens at least thrice, which we can deduce from ""lug walm wif,"" where ""blue"" is repeated three times despite ""wif"" following immediately after.

Hence, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule:
walm -> Causes the color word that precedes ""walm"" to repeat three times, this pattern continues until a different color word appears or it concludes with an alternative word (like ""wif"" in the last example, which then has its associated color outputted once).

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif walm lug
    ",Output: red red red blue,red red red blue,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the word ""lug"" translates to the color ""blue"" consistently. Therefore, the rule can be stated as:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Based on the repeated pattern in all examples, every time the nonce word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" Hence, we can infer that in this context, ""dax"" means ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: Each instance of ""wif"" directly translates to the color red in the output.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the provided examples, the word ""bluf"" appears to repeat the color associated with the word that directly precedes it. Here are the observed patterns:

- When ""wif"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""red"" is repeated (""wif bluf"" -> ""red red"").
- When ""zup"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""yellow"" is repeated (""zup bluf"" -> ""yellow yellow"").
- When ""lug"" comes before ""bluf"", the color ""blue"" is repeated (""lug bluf"" -> ""blue blue"").

Therefore, the rule associated with the nonce word ""bluf"" seems to be that it causes the preceding word's color to be outputted twice.

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color of the preceding word.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following pattern for the output colors with respect to the input words:

- The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue.""
- The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
- The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red.""
  
Now, observing the outputs where the nonce word ""walm"" is present:

- In the first example, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""green.""
- In the second example, ""walm"" is followed by three instances of ""blue.""
- In the third example, ""walm"" is between ""lug"" and ""dax,"" and the output sequence is three times ""blue,"" followed by ""green."" Notably, when ""walm"" is preceded or followed by ""wif,"" this leads to multiple instances of ""red.""
- In the fourth example, ""walm"" follows ""wif"" and is followed by ""dax,"" resulting in three instances of ""red,"" followed by ""green.""
- In the fifth example, ""walm"" follows ""dax"" and is followed by ""lug,"" resulting in three instances of ""green,"" followed by ""blue.""

From these observations, we can deduce the rule that the nonce word ""walm"" causes the color of the word that follows it to be repeated three times. The color associated with ""walm"" itself seems to take the color of the word that precedes it.

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" repeats the color of the next word three times. If there's a word before ""walm,"" it takes on that word's color for its own output; otherwise, it might either default to a color or the behavior may be undefined based on the given information.

So:
walm -> Repeat the following word's color thrice and take the preceding word's color for itself.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, the rule for the nonce word ""lug"" appears to be consistent across all instances. Regardless of its position in a sequence of words, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax translates to ""green"". 

Whenever the input contains ""dax,"" the corresponding output includes the word ""green."" 

Further evidence can be seen when ""dax"" is combined with other nonce words (lug, bluf, zup, walm), the other nonce words translate consistently to the same colours in different uses, suggesting that ""dax"" independently retains the meaning of green regardless of context.
Based on the examples provided, each nonce word seems to translate to a specific color. The word 'wif' consistently translates to 'red' in every example.

Here is the rule induction based on the given inputs and outputs:

- Every instance of ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"".
- ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"".
- ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue"".
- ""walm"" has not been given an output example, but considering the pattern, it may correspond to a color not yet represented, possibly ""blue"" given its repetition in the last example.
- ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" based on the third input-output pair.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The nonce word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow,"" irrespective of its position in the sequence.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" let us compare the inputs with their corresponding outputs:

1. Input: dax lug bluf
   Output: green blue blue
   (Here, ""dax"" maps to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to the first ""blue"")

2. Input: wif bluf dax walm
   Output: red red green green green
   (In this example, ""wif"" maps to ""red,"" ""dax"" to the first ""green,"" and ""walm"" to the last two ""green"")

3. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   (Here, ""dax"" maps to the first ""green"")

4. Input: dax wif dax zup bluf
   Output: green red green yellow yellow
   (In this sequence, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""wif"" to ""red,"" and ""zup"" to the first ""yellow"")

5. Input: dax lug walm dax wif bluf dax
   Output: green blue blue blue green red red green
   (Again, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" ""lug"" to the first ""blue,"" ""walm"" to ""blue,"" and ""wif"" to ""red"")

Analyzing the above, we see that ""bluf"" is always followed by a color repeated once or twice—specifically, the color that directly precedes it in the output. It appears that ""bluf"" corresponds to a repetition of the preceding color word in the output.

Rule: bluf -> repeats the immediately preceding color in the output.
walm -> repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When walm follows a color-associated nonce word, it results in the repetition of the color associated with that nonce word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: lug zup
    ",Output: blue yellow,blue yellow,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the given examples, we can deduce a pattern for the meaning of the nonce word ""lug"":

- When ""lug"" is stated after ""dax,"" the next word is ""blue"" in the Output.
- When ""lug"" is stated after ""wif,"" the next word is ""blue"" in the Output.
- When ""lug"" is stated before ""wif,"" the word before ""lug"" is ""red"" in the Output.
- ""Lug"" does not change its output based on the surrounding words, as it consistently translates to ""blue"" regardless of position.

Therefore, the rule we can derive is:

lug -> meaning: blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently correlates with the output ""green,"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or other words present.
Based on the given examples, it appears that each instance of ""wif"" in the input corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output. Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow

The examples consistently show that whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the word ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.
Based on the input-output examples provided, it appears that each word translates to a color, where ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""red."" Therefore, the inferred rule is as follows:

Rule: bluf -> red
From the given examples, we can deduce that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color output of the word that precedes it multiple times.

Here's the pattern based on the examples:

- ""wif lug walm"" -> red blue **blue blue**
- ""dax zup walm wif"" -> green yellow **yellow yellow** red
- ""wif walm"" -> red **red red**
- ""lug wif dax zup walm"" -> blue red green yellow **yellow yellow**
- ""dax lug walm"" -> green blue **blue blue**

In every case, ""walm"" causes the output to replicate the color that corresponds to the word immediately before it. The number of times the color is repeated seems to be three, regardless of which color it is.

Therefore, the rule is:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color corresponding to the previous word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Each time the word ""dax"" appears in the input, the output is ""green.""
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" consistently translates to the color ""red"" in each given output.
Rule: zup -> yellow
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""bluf"" is not directly translated to a specific color on its own. Instead, its meaning is contingent upon the word that precedes it. Here are the observed rules:

- When preceded by ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow.""
- When preceded by ""dax,"" the output is ""green green.""
- When preceded by ""lug,"" the output is ""blue blue.""
- When ""wif"" and ""lug"" precede ""bluf,"" the output includes the colors corresponding to those words (""red"" and ""blue"") each repeated once before the word ""bluf,"" and then ""bluf"" is translated as ""blue"" itself.

From these observations, the rule for ""bluf"" can be induced as follows:

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word directly before it. If the word before it corresponds to ""red,"" ""bluf"" means red. If the word before it corresponds to ""blue,"" ""bluf"" means blue, and so on. If multiple different colors precede ""bluf,"" it takes the color of the immediately preceding word.

Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""walm"" correlates with a pattern of color words repeated consecutively in the output, starting with the color word that follows ""walm"" in the sequence. Each color output after the appearance of ""walm"" is repeated based on the occurrence of this word ""walm"".

Here's the breakdown according to the pattern:

1) wif bluf dax walm -> red red green green green
- `wif` translates to `red`
- `bluf` translates to `red` again
- `dax` translates to `green`
- `walm` associates with the following word (`green`) and repeats it two additional times.

2) wif walm -> red red red
- `wif` translates to `red`
- `walm` associates with the following word (`red`) and repeats it twice, as there is no word following ""walm"", it duplicates the last mentioned color.

3) dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
- `dax` translates to `green`
- `lug` translates to `blue`
- `walm` associates with the following word (`blue`) and repeats it twice.

4) dax walm wif lug dax walm -> green green green red blue green green green
- `dax` translates to `green`
- `walm` associates with the following word (`green`) and repeats it twice.
- `wif` translates to `red`
- `lug` translates to `blue`
- a second `dax` translates to `green`
- a second `walm` associates with the following word (`green`) and repeats it twice.

5) zup lug walm wif dax -> yellow blue blue blue red green
- `zup` translates to `yellow`
- `lug` translates to `blue`
- `walm` associates with the following word (`blue`) and repeats it twice.
- `wif` translates to `red`
- `dax` translates to `green`

Rule: walm -> replicates the color following its occurrence an additional two times. If no color word follows ""walm"", replicate the last mentioned color twice.

The general rule for ""walm"" is that it acts as a trigger to repeat the next color in the sequence two additional times, forming a color pattern repetition. If ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence with no word after it to indicate which color to repeat, the last mentioned color is the one that gets repeated.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

- In the first input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""
- In the second input, ""dax"" appears twice and both times corresponds to ""green""
- In the third input, ""dax"" again corresponds to ""green""
- In the fourth input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" 
- In the fifth input, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green""

Given this consistent correspondence, the rule is:

  Output: green yellow yellow

Each instance of ""bluf"" outputs the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it. The pattern appears to be that ""bluf"" takes on the color value of the preceding word. Therefore, the rule for ""bluf"" appears to be that it mirrors the color associated with the word just before it in the sequence.

Rule: bluf -> takes the color value of the word immediately preceding it.
walm -> blue

Rule: The nonce word ""walm"" corresponds to the color blue. Every instance of ""walm"" in the input is matched with ""blue"" in the output.

Rule: wif -> red.
Based on the examples provided, it seems like each word corresponds to a specific color. The word 'dax' consistently translates to 'green', 'lug' translates to 'blue', and 'wif' translates to 'red'. The word 'zup' seems always to correspond to 'yellow' regardless of its position in the sequence. None of the provided inputs suggest that 'zup' changes meaning based on surrounding words or context.

    Rules:

Based on the given examples, it seems that ""dax"" translates to the color ""green."" No matter the context in which ""dax"" appears, the output consistently maps to ""green.""

Rule: dax -> green.
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red"" regardless of its position in the input sequence. Every instance of ""wif"" leads to ""red"" in the output sequence.

Rule: wif -> red
Rule: zup -> yellow
bluf -> blue

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color ""blue"" in the outputs provided. The other words in the inputs correlate with their respective colors as well: ""dax"" with ""green,"" ""wif"" with ""red,"" ""zup"" with ""yellow,"" and ""lug"" with ""blue."" However, the consistent factor is that irrespective of position or combination with other words, ""bluf"" always results in the color ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we can attempt to induce the rule underlying the nonce word ""walm."" The following observations can be made from the input-output pairs:

1. Whenever ""walm"" appears after ""dax"" or ""lug,"" the corresponding output is ""green"" followed by a repetition of the color that matches ""walm.""
2. When ""walm"" appears after ""wif,"" the output is ""red"" followed by a repetition of the previous color.
3. ""walm"" on its own followed by ""wif"" results in ""red red red,"" which suggests that ""walm"" could inherit the color red, but also make it repeat.
4. The number of colors in the output matches the number of words in the input.

From these observations, the following rule can be inferred:

Rule: The word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the previous word in the input sequence. If ""walm"" is preceded by ""wif,"" it results in a sequence of red. It repeats the previous color as many times as ""walm"" appears in succession. If ""walm"" is the last word in the sequence, the last color is red, but if ""walm"" is followed by another word, it seems to continue the pattern of the preceding word's associated color, unless the word is ""bluf,"" which then adds an extra red at the end.

Therefore:

walm -> meaning: Repeat the previous word's associated color, with a nuance when followed by ""wif"" (resulting in red repetition), and if it is the last word, ensure the final color is red unless followed by ""bluf,"" which adds an extra red.


    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Each instance of ""lug"" in the input corresponds to ""blue"" in the output.
Based on the examples provided, we see the following correspondence between input and output:

- Whenever 'dax' is presented, the output is 'green.'
- The word 'wif' corresponds to 'red.'
- The word 'walm' corresponds to 'green.'
- The word 'zup' corresponds to 'yellow.'
- The word 'lug' corresponds to 'blue.'
- The word 'bluf' corresponds to 'blue.'

Given these observations, we can conclude:

Rule: The presence of the word 'dax' always results in the output 'green.' It does not depend on the position or the presence of other words. Therefore:

dax -> green
From the examples given, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of the word ""wif"":

Whenever ""wif"" appears, the corresponding output is ""red"". The presence of ""wif"" does not appear to depend on its position in the input sequence. It consistently translates to ""red"" regardless of the other words around it. Other words in the examples correspond to other colors, but ""wif"" is exclusively related to the color ""red"".

Therefore, based on the examples provided, the rule is:
Rule: wif -> red
Examining the examples provided:

1. ""zup dax wif zup"" -> ""yellow green red yellow""
2. ""dax lug walm zup wif"" -> ""green blue blue blue yellow red""
3. ""zup walm wif"" -> ""yellow yellow yellow red""
4. ""dax zup dax walm"" -> ""green yellow green green green""
5. ""zup wif lug"" -> ""yellow red blue""

Through these examples, we can observe the following patterns concerning the word 'zup':

- Whenever 'zup' occurs, the word 'yellow' appears in the corresponding position in the output.
- 'zup' does not depend on its position in the input to be translated into 'yellow'.
- 'zup' is consistently translated to 'yellow', irrespective of the surrounding words.

Based on these observations, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: zup -> yellow

This means that 'zup' corresponds to the color 'yellow' in the output.
Based on the given input-output examples, it seems we need to determine what ""bluf"" represents in the context of other words that correspond to colors. Here is the analysis:

- In the first example, ""dax lug wif bluf"" translates to ""green blue red red"". Since ""bluf"" is the last word and the last color is ""red"", it might suggest that ""bluf"" means ""red"". However, we need more evidence.
  
- In the second example, ""wif zup bluf lug"" translates to ""red yellow yellow blue"". Here ""bluf"" comes before ""lug"" and since ""lug"" translates to ""blue"", this indicates ""bluf"" could mean ""yellow"", but this conflicts with the first example.

- In the third instance, ""wif bluf dax walm"" translates to ""red red green green green"". ""Bluf"" is followed by ""dax"" which we know translates to ""green"". The output does not have two consecutive colors unless ""bluf"" and ""dax"" both mean ""green"" but the output has an extra ""green"" so there must be more to it.

- In the fourth example, ""dax zup bluf"" translates to ""green yellow yellow"". Here, ""bluf"" is in the last position, and the corresponding color sequence ends in ""yellow"". This again challenges the initial proposition, but when we look at the previous examples, we can infer ""zup"" is translating to ""yellow"" and ""dax"" to ""green"".

- Finally, in the fifth example, ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" translates to ""yellow red red yellow blue"", which suggests ""zup"" is ""yellow"", ""wif"" is ""red"", and ""lug"" is ""blue"". If ""bluf"" is ""red"" in this sequence, then ""bluf"" and ""wif"" both translate to ""red"".

Rule induction based on the conflicting evidence suggests that ""bluf"" does not represent a single color. Instead, it likely represents a rule or is context-dependent. One possibility could be that ""bluf"" represents a repetition of the color corresponding to the word directly before it. This rule would work for all the given examples:

- ""dax lug wif bluf"" -> ""green blue red red""
- ""wif zup bluf lug"" -> ""red yellow yellow blue""
- ""wif bluf dax walm"" -> ""red red green green green"" (This also suggests that ""walm"" adds an extra ""green"" to the sequence, but as we're focusing on ""bluf"", we won't expand on this rule.)
- ""dax zup bluf"" -> ""green yellow yellow""
- ""zup wif bluf zup lug"" -> ""yellow red red yellow blue""

So, the rule for ""bluf"" could be deduced as:

bluf -> meaning. Meaning is that ""bluf"" repeats the color of the previous word.
Rule: ""bluf"" repeats the color corresponding to the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.
By examining each input where the word ""walm"" appears and comparing it to the respective output, we can deduce a rule for the meaning of ""walm.""

Input: dax walm wif zup
Output: green green green red yellow
- Here, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""walm"" that follows also corresponds to ""green."" ""Wif"" and ""zup"" correspond to ""red"" and ""yellow"" respectively.

Input: wif lug walm
Output: red blue blue blue
- ""Wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" ""lug"" to ""blue,"" and since ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" it results in ""blue.""

Input: dax walm
Output: green green green
- ""Dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and again ""walm"" after ""dax"" means ""green.""

Input: lug walm
Output: blue blue blue
- ""Lug"" corresponds to ""blue"" and ""walm"" following ""lug"" is also ""blue.""

Input: zup lug zup walm dax wif bluf
Output: yellow blue yellow yellow yellow green red red
- Here, we see ""zup"" is ""yellow,"" ""lug"" is ""blue,"" and then ""zup"" again is ""yellow."" ""Walm"" follows a ""zup"" and results in ""yellow."" ""Dax"" is ""green,"" ""wif"" is ""red"" and ""bluf"" is ""red"" as well.

Based on these examples, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" takes on the color value of the word that directly precedes it.

So the rule for ""walm"" is:

walm -> meaning. The meaning of ""walm"" is to repeat the color of the word before it.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: zup wif zup

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently corresponds to the color ""blue"" in each provided example, regardless of its position in the sequence or the other words present.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, we can induce the following relationships between inputs and their respective outputs:

Input: wif dax zup bluf
Output: red green yellow yellow

Input: lug walm wif
Output: blue blue blue red

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Input: dax bluf wif zup dax
Output: green green red yellow green

Input: zup wif walm
Output: yellow red red red

Analyzing these, we see that:

- ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green""
- ""zup"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""bluf"" consistently translates to ""yellow""
- ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue""
- ""walm"" — considering its position changes yet maintains ""red"" — appears to translate to ""red""

Now considering ""wif"":

- In the first example, ""wif"" precedes ""dax"" (which is ""green"") and the output is ""red"".
- In the second example, ""wif"" comes at the end after two instances of ""walm"" (which is ""red"") and outputs ""red"".
- In the third example, ""wif"" follows ""zup"" (which is ""yellow"") and precedes ""walm"" (which is ""red""), resulting in ""red"".
- In the fourth example, ""wif"" is surrounded by ""bluf"" and ""zup"" (both ""yellow"") and ""dax"" (which is ""green""), and the output for ""wif"" is ""red"".
- In the fifth example, it's the same as the third, with ""wif"" outputting ""red"".

From these observations, it appears ""wif"" consistently translates to ""red"", regardless of its position or the colors surrounding it.

Rule: wif -> red.
To deduce the meaning of the nonce word ""zup,"" we need to analyze the patterns in the provided examples. From the examples given, it seems that each word corresponds to a color output:

- ""wif"" corresponds to red
- ""walm"" corresponds to red red red
- ""bluf"" corresponds to yellow
- ""dax"" corresponds to green

By comparing instances where ""zup"" is present with those where it is absent, we can try to identify what ""zup"" contributes to the sequence:

1. ""wif zup"" produces ""red yellow,"" while ""wif"" on its own is associated with ""red."" From this example, ""zup"" on its own might be associated with ""yellow.""
   
2. ""zup wif walm"" produces ""yellow red red red,"" we already know ""wif walm"" would produce ""red red red red,"" which implies ""zup"" at the beginning changes the first red to yellow.
   
3. ""zup bluf wif bluf"" produces ""yellow yellow red red,"" which suggests that ""zup"" again turns ""bluf"" (which produces ""yellow"") into ""yellow"" and has no impact on ""wif,"" as ""wif bluf"" would produce ""red yellow.""
   
4. ""dax zup bluf"" output is ""green yellow yellow,"" indicating that ""zup"" between ""dax"" and ""bluf"" changes ""dax"" (which produces ""green"") to remain as ""green” but changes ""bluf"" to ""yellow.""
   
5. ""zup dax bluf"" outputs ""yellow green green,"" which suggests that ""zup"" before ""dax"" changes ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""zup"" before ""bluf"" continues to result in ""yellow.""

Since ""zup"" consistently appears to produce ""yellow"" when preceding a color, regardless of what follows after, the role of ""zup"" is likely to be an indicator for the color ""yellow.""

Rule: zup -> yellow

Each word after ""zup"" retains its original color output. However, where ""zup"" appears, it inserts ""yellow"" at its position in the sequence, and the following colors remain unchanged.
Based on the provided examples, we are to determine the rule for the nonce word ""bluf."" Let's examine the occurrences of ""bluf"" and the corresponding output:

1. lug bluf -> blue red
2. zup dax bluf -> yellow green green
3. wif bluf -> red red
4. lug bluf -> blue red
5. lug wif bluf -> blue red red

Notice that after ""bluf"" is mentioned in the input, in the corresponding output, the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" is repeated twice. For instance:

- In ""lug walm wif lug bluf"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" in the input and ""blue"" is repeated twice in the output.
- In ""zup dax bluf"", no word follows ""bluf""; hence, nothing is repeated in the output.
- In ""wif bluf lug"", ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug"" in the input and ""red"" is repeated twice in the output.

From this pattern, we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates that the next word (if there is one) should have its corresponding output color repeated twice.

Rule: bluf -> the next word (if there is one) in the input sequence has its output color repeated twice. If ""bluf"" is the last word in the input sequence, nothing is repeated in the output.
walm -> repetition. Rule: The word ""walm"" induces repetition of the color associated with the last color word mentioned before it, for a total of three repetitions.

Example analysis:

1. ""wif walm"" leads to ""red red red"". Here, ""wif"" corresponds to the color red, and ""walm"" causes red to be repeated three times.
2. ""dax lug wif walm"" results in ""green blue red red red"". Here, each word corresponds to a color: ""dax"" to green, ""lug"" to blue, and ""wif"" to red. ""walm"" again causes the last mentioned color (red) to be repeated three times.
3. ""zup walm"" gives ""yellow yellow yellow"". The word ""zup"" is linked to yellow, and ""walm"" leads to three instances of yellow.
4. ""lug walm dax wif lug wif"" produces ""blue blue blue green red blue red"". The pattern follows the respective colors except for ""walm"", which triggers repeating the last mentioned color (""lug"" = blue) three times.
5. ""dax lug dax lug walm"" leads to ""green blue green blue blue blue"". Each color word translates to its corresponding color, and ""walm"" repeats the last color (blue) three times.

In all examples, ""walm"" consistently causes the last mentioned color to be repeated three times, regardless of what the color is.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in the given examples.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" seems to correspond to the color ""green"" in each case. It is consistent across examples and independent of the context or the position of the word within a sequence. Thus, we can induce the following rule:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the word ""wif"" corresponds to the color ""red."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""wif"" always leads to ""red"" in the output sequence. The rule that can be induced from the given examples is as follows:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> meaning. Based on the given examples, the meaning of the word ""zup"" can be deduced to be ""yellow.""

Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, the corresponding output is ""yellow.""
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" corresponds to the color red in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the output pattern for ""walm"" seems consistent regardless of the other words present in the input. Every time ""walm"" appears in the input, the word that precedes it is repeated three times in the corresponding color in the output. 

More specifically:
- ""dax walm"" produces ""green green green"". ""Dax"" corresponds to the color green.
- ""lug walm"" produces ""blue blue blue"". ""Lug"" corresponds to the color blue.
- There are no instances where ""wif"" or ""zup"" appear directly followed by ""walm"" without another word in between, but looking at the context we see ""wif"" corresponds to the color red and ""zup"" to yellow. 

Therefore, the rule appears to be that ""walm"" causes the output to be the color associated with the preceding word, repeated three times.

Rule: walm -> when after a word X, outputs the color associated with word X, repeated three times.

Based on the provided examples, the word ""walm"" seems to indicate a repetition of the color associated with the preceding word. To further illustrate:

- In the first example, ""lug wif walm lug"" translates to ""blue red red red blue,"" indicating that walm caused the color red associated with ""wif"" to repeat twice more.
- In the second example, ""zup dax walm zup wif"" yields ""yellow green green green yellow red,"" showing that ""dax,"" which correlates with green, was repeated twice more due to walm.
- The third and fifth examples, ""zup walm"" and ""dax walm,"" result in three repetitions of the associated colors yellow and green, respectively, without any subsequent words to change the pattern.

Therefore, the rule for the word ""walm"" seems to be repeating the preceding color word three times.

The examples provided indicate that every time the word ""dax"" is used, the output is ""green."" The pattern shown doesn't change with the position of the word ""dax"" in the input sequence, meaning that ""dax"" consistently translates to the word ""green,"" regardless of the surrounding words.
Based on the given examples, it appears that the nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red.""

Here is the breakdown of the given inputs and their corresponding outputs:

Input: wif lug -> Output: red blue
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif -> Output: yellow red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: dax zup dax zup wif -> Output: green yellow green yellow red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: wif bluf -> Output: red red
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Input: zup wif dax walm lug -> Output: yellow red green green green blue
  - ""wif"" corresponds to ""red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow. Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in every example provided.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to analyze the common factor between all instances where ""bluf"" appears and the associated color in the output.

Let's go through the examples one by one:

1. Input: ""dax zup bluf"" 
   Output: ""green yellow yellow""

2. Input: ""lug bluf wif"" 
   Output: ""blue blue red""

3. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup"" 
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow""

4. Input: ""zup lug wif dax bluf wif"" 
   Output: ""yellow blue red green green red""

5. Input: ""dax zup wif bluf lug"" 
   Output: ""green yellow red red blue""

Based on these examples, we can observe the following pattern:

- Whenever the word ""bluf"" appears, the color in the same position in the output is the same as the color of the word that immediately follows ""bluf"" in the input. 

Let's check to confirm:

- Example 1: ""bluf"" is followed by no words, but the corresponding color is ""yellow,"" which is the color for ""zup"" that precedes it.
- Example 2: ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is ""red,"" which matches the color of ""wif.""
- Example 3: ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is ""blue,"" matching the color of ""lug.""
- Example 4: ""bluf"" is followed by ""wif,"" and the corresponding color is ""green,"" which doesn't match with ""wif,"" indicating there might be more to the rule or an exception.
- Example 5: ""bluf"" is followed by ""lug,"" and the corresponding color is ""red,"" which again doesn't match the expected pattern. 

From these observations, we seem to have some conflicting evidence. In examples 2 and 3, our initial hypothesis holds true. However, in examples 4 and 5, ""bluf"" precedes ""wif,"" yet the corresponding colors are ""green"" and ""red,"" respectively, which conflicts with the previously observed pattern.

It's possible that the rule for ""bluf"" may not only depend on the word that follows but also on the word that precedes it. However, given the conflicting data from examples 4 and 5 compared to our initial pattern, we cannot definitively determine the singular meaning or rule of ""bluf"" with the provided data. 

Furthermore, in examples 1 and 3, ""bluf"" corresponds to the color of ""zup,"" which is ""yellow."" But since these are the only cases where ""bluf"" is not followed by another word and they are followed and preceded by ""zup"", we don't have enough evidence to conclude that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word preceding it, only that it might take the color of ""zup"".

We might assume that ""bluf"" takes the color of ""zup"" when it stands last in the sequence or ""bluf"" just repeats the color stated before it, but we don't have sufficient examples to conclude that with confidence.

Until additional patterns can be observed with more examples, we cannot establish a comprehensive rule for ""bluf.""

Rule: Indeterminate based on the provided data. Further examples would be required to establish a rule for ""bluf.""
Rule: walm -> repeated color of the preceding word.
- In each example, ""walm"" results in the repetition of the color associated with the word that comes directly before it.
- When ""dax"" precedes ""walm,"" ""green"" is repeated three times.
- When ""zup"" precedes ""walm,"" ""yellow"" is repeated three times.
- When ""lug"" precedes ""walm,"" ""blue"" is repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
To deduce the meaning of ""lug,"" let's look for patterns within the input/output pairs.

- In the first input, ""lug"" correlates with the output ""blue.""
- In the second input, ""lug"" is again associated with ""blue.""
- The third input once more links ""lug"" with ""blue.""
- In the fourth input, ""lug"" corresponds to the output ""blue.""
- Finally, in the last input, ""lug"" consistently translates to ""blue.""

In every provided example, regardless of the position of ""lug"" within the sequence, it consistently corresponds to the output ""blue.""

Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The term ""dax"" corresponds to the color green.
wif -> red

Rule: The nonce word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"" regardless of its position within the sequence.
Based on the given examples, it appears that ""zup"" consistently maps to the word ""yellow."" Whenever ""zup"" appears in the input, ""yellow"" appears in the corresponding position in the output.

Therefore, the rule for the nonce word ""zup"" is as follows:

Rule: zup -> yellow.
Based on the provided examples, there is a pattern that connects ""bluf"" to a color output. When the word ""bluf"" is present in the input, the corresponding output is always ""yellow."" However, in the context of the second example, ""lug bluf,"" although ""lug"" is associated with ""blue,"" ""bluf"" maintains its association with ""yellow,"" thus ""blue blue"" is not a consequence of ""bluf,"" but rather ""lug.""

The pattern suggests the following direct translation:

""lug"" -> blue
""zup"" -> yellow
""wif"" -> red
""dax"" -> green

Hence, regardless of the context in the given examples, ""bluf"" directly translates to ""yellow.""

Rule: bluf -> yellow
Rule: walm -> blue

Each instance of ""walm"" in the input corresponds to the color blue in the output.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: dax wif zup dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue."" Every time ""lug"" appears in the input, ""blue"" is used in the output.
Based on the provided examples, the word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the output ""green."" There does not seem to be any context-dependent variability in the meaning associated with ""dax,"" as it always results in ""green"" regardless of its position in the input sequence or the surrounding words.

Therefore, the rule is as follows:

dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" consistently translates to the color ""green.""
Given the examples, it appears that ""wif"" translates to a specific color in the output. Analyzing the provided inputs and their corresponding outputs, here are the correlations between the inputs and the outputs:

- Every ""wif"" corresponds to the word ""red"" in the output.
- The word ""dax"" corresponds to ""green.""
- The word ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue.""
- The word ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow.""
- The word ""walm"" produces three ""blue"" colors in a row.

With this information, we can deduce the following rule:

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" represents the color yellow. Each time it appears in an input, the output includes the word ""yellow."" Other words in the inputs seem to correspond to other colors based on repetition and pattern (e.g., ""wif"" -> red, ""bluf"" -> yellow, ""dax"" -> green, ""walm"" -> blue). The output pattern suggests a one-to-one correspondence between the input words and a color in the output.
From the examples given, it appears that the word ""bluf"" causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word. For instance, in the first example, ""wif"" corresponds to red, and following ""bluf,"" the output is ""red red,"" indicating that ""bluf"" caused the previous color to be repeated. Analyzing the other examples provided confirms this repetitive behavior.

Rule: bluf -> causes the output to repeat the color of the previous word.
Based on the given examples, we can infer a pattern related to the appearance of the word ""walm"" within the inputs and how it translates into colored outputs. We need to look for consistencies across different examples to understand the functionality or meaning of ""walm.""

Here's the analysis of the examples:

1. Input: lug walm
   Output: blue blue blue
   - ""lug"" results in one ""blue.""

2. Input: dax lug walm
   Output: green blue blue blue
   - ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and adding ""lug"" before ""walm"" resulted in one ""blue.""

3. Input: dax walm wif
   Output: green green green red
   - ""dax"" results in ""green,"" and ""wif"" results in ""red."" 

4. Input: dax lug walm zup wif
   Output: green blue blue blue yellow red
   - ""zup"" introduces a ""yellow"" and we see ""lug"" and ""walm"" together producing three ""blue.""

5. Input: lug zup walm lug
   Output: blue yellow yellow yellow blue
   - ""lug"" is both at the start and end, resulting in ""blue"" at both the start and end, while ""zup"" in the middle introduces ""yellow.""

From this analysis, we can induce the rule:

Rule: The word ""walm"" causes the color generated by the immediately preceding word to be repeated in the output. If no word precedes ""walm,"" then the sequence of ""blue"" is produced.

So, the meaning of ""walm"" is as follows:

walm -> Repeat the color associated with the preceding word in the sequence or default to ""blue"" if there is no preceding word.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf
Output: blue blue blue green green


    Return the output preceded by 'Output:'
    Input: wif lug dax wif walm
    ",Output: red blue green red red red,red blue green red red red,True
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
The consistent output for every occurrence of ""lug"" in the input is ""blue"".
Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples, it seems that the word 'wif' corresponds to the color 'red'. Every time 'wif' appears in the input, 'red' is part of the output.

The rule appears to be consistent across the given examples, with 'wif' exclusively translating to 'red' no matter its position in the sequence or the other words present.

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" consistently translates to the color ""yellow"" in all given examples.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" we will analyze each instance where it occurs and see if there is a consistent pattern or correspondence with the output provided.

Input: dax bluf lug wif
Output: green green blue red

Input: lug wif lug bluf
Output: blue red blue blue

Input: lug bluf zup lug
Output: blue blue yellow blue

Input: wif dax wif bluf zup wif
Output: red green red red yellow red

Input: wif walm lug bluf
Output: red red red blue blue

From the above examples, whenever ""bluf"" appears in the input:

1. In the first example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
2. In the second example, ""bluf"" again corresponds to ""blue.""
3. In the third example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue.""
4. In the fourth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""red,"" but this does not match the previous instances. However, this instance also has two ""wif"" before ""bluf,"" which could mean ""wif"" may affect its meaning.
5. In the fifth example, ""bluf"" corresponds to ""blue blue,"" but here it seems to repeat the color corresponding to ""lug,"" which precedes ""bluf.""

From this analysis, it seems that ""bluf"" generally means ""blue."" However, there appears to be a rule in the fourth example where the presence of two instances of ""wif"" before ""bluf"" changes its meaning. In the fifth example, since ""lug"" means blue and ""bluf"" follows it, resulting in ""blue blue,"" ""bluf"" mimics the color of the word right before it if that word is ""lug."" 

Rule: ""bluf"" usually means ""blue,"" but its meaning can change based on the context; with a preceding ""lug,"" it repeats the blue color; with two preceding ""wif,"" it changes to red. The change in meaning may be related to the sequence or repetition of certain words before ""bluf."" 

Therefore, the general rule seems to be context-dependent, but the default interpretation without additional context is:

bluf -> blue
Based on the provided examples, it seems that the word ""walm"" corresponds to a repetition of the color associated with the word that comes just before it. Here's the breakdown:

- In ""zup wif walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow"" and ""wif"" to ""red."" ""walm"" causes ""red"" to repeat three times.
- In ""wif lug walm,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.
- In ""zup walm,"" ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" and ""walm"" causes ""yellow"" to repeat two more times.
- In ""lug walm,"" ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat two more times.
- In ""dax lug walm,"" ""dax"" corresponds to ""green"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""walm"" causes ""blue"" to repeat three times.

Therefore, we can induce that ""walm"" leads to the repetition of the color associated with the immediately preceding word, with the total number of repetitions (including the initial occurrence) being equal to the number of words before ""walm"" plus one.

Rule: walm -> Causes the color of the preceding word to repeat a number of times equal to the number of words preceding ""walm"" + 1.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm
Output: red red red

Input: lug walm dax bluf

    Input: zup bluf lug zup walm lug
    ",Output: yellow blue blue yellow yellow yellow blue blue,yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow blue,False
"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: Every instance of the word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color ""green"" in every example given.
wif -> red

Rule: The word ""wif"" translates to the color ""red"".
zup -> meaning: yellow. Rule: Whenever the word ""zup"" appears in the input, it is translated to ""yellow"" in the output.
To determine the meaning of ""bluf,"" let's compare the input sequences with their outputs and focus on the instances where ""bluf"" appears.

1. dax zup bluf -> green yellow yellow
2. zup bluf lug zup -> yellow yellow blue yellow
3. lug bluf -> blue blue
4. wif dax zup wif dax bluf -> red green yellow red green green
5. lug wif dax bluf wif lug -> blue red green green red blue

Analyzing the outputs where ""bluf"" is translated, the pattern that emerges is that the color associated with ""bluf"" is the same as the color associated with the word that immediately precedes ""bluf"" in the input.

So, the rule for ""bluf"" is:

bluf -> The output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the color output for the word that comes immediately before ""bluf"".

Rule: If ""word"" is followed by ""bluf,"" then ""bluf"" translates to the same color output as ""word.""
walm -> repeating the color associated with the preceding word. Rule: When ""walm"" follows a color-indicating word (like ""dax"" for green, ""lug"" for blue, or ""zup"" for yellow), it indicates that the color should be repeated a number of times based on its appearance directly before ""walm"". If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif"" (which indicates red), it seems that ""walm"" repeats the previous color but is finally followed by red.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
Output: blue blue

Input: wif walm

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
lug -> blue

Rule: The word ""lug"" consistently translates to the color ""blue"" in all provided examples.
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" translates to the color green.
Based on the examples provided, each instance where ""wif"" is used corresponds to the output ""red."" It appears that regardless of the context or the other words around it, the appearance of ""wif"" consistently maps to the output color red. Therefore, the simplest rule that explains all the given data points is:

Rule: wif -> red.
zup -> yellow

Rule: ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the sequence.
Based on the given examples, the word ""bluf"" results in the color that precedes it appearing twice in sequence in the output. Here are the observed patterns for each input example:

1. lug bluf wif -> blue blue red (bluf causes ""blue"" to repeat)
2. zup wif bluf zup lug -> yellow red red yellow blue (bluf follows ""red"" but doesn't repeat it because it's followed by another word)
3. lug bluf zup -> blue blue yellow (bluf causes ""blue"" to repeat)
4. zup bluf wif -> yellow yellow red (bluf causes ""yellow"" to repeat)
5. lug bluf -> blue blue (bluf causes ""blue"" to repeat)

Rule: When ""bluf"" is preceded by a color, that color is repeated in the output. If ""bluf"" is followed by a different word (color or not), the preceding color is not repeated.

However, example 2 potentially disrupts the pattern because ""bluf"" doesn't cause a repeat after ""wif"" (which leads to the output ""red""). If bluf always caused the previous color word to be repeated, we would have expected an output of ""yellow red red yellow red"". 

Additionally, we don't have examples of ""bluf"" being used at the start of an input or between two colors that are different. These cases would further clarify the rule.

Based on these observations, I will create a tentative rule by excluding the second example as an outlier:

Rule: bluf -> causes the immediately preceding color to be repeated in the output (excluding instances where bluf is followed by a different word).
walm -> meaning. Based on the presented examples, the rule appears to be that walm causes the next color to repeat three times.

Rule: When walm is followed by another word, the color associated with that word is repeated three times. If walm is at the end of the series, it repeats the color of the word before walm three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
From the provided examples, the term ""dax"" seems to correspond to a specific color in the output. Each usage of ""dax"" in the input leads to ""green"" in the output. The other words in the input correspond to other colors: ""wif"" to ""red"", ""lug"" to ""blue"", ""zup"" to ""yellow"", and ""walm"" also to ""red"". 

Therefore, the rule can be deduced as follows:

Rule: dax -> green
Based on the examples provided, the word ""wif"" seems to correspond to the color ""red"". Every time the word ""wif"" is present in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the output. It does not appear to change based on context or position within the list of words.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" translates to the color ""yellow"" regardless of the context in which it is used.
To deduce the meaning of ""bluf,"" we need to identify patterns in its usage in relation to the output provided. Let's examine the examples:

1. Input: wif zup bluf lug walm dax lug
   Output: red yellow yellow blue blue blue green blue
   
2. Input: wif bluf zup
   Output: red red yellow
   
3. Input: dax wif bluf
   Output: green red red
   
4. Input: dax bluf
   Output: green green
   
5. Input: dax bluf wif lug zup
   Output: green green red blue yellow

Now, analyze the input-output relations with a focus on the position of ""bluf"":

- In examples 1 and 5, ""bluf"" follows the word ""lug"" and in both instances, the output for ""lug"" right before ""bluf"" is ""blue"".
- In examples 2, 3, and 4, ""bluf"" follows either ""wif"" or ""dax"" and in those instances, the output for ""bluf"" is the same color as the word before it.

Based on the above observations, we can induce the following rule for the meaning of ""bluf"":

bluf -> meaning: ""bluf"" repeats the color of the word immediately preceding it.

Rule: If ""bluf"" follows another word, it takes the same color as the preceding word in the output.
To determine the meaning of the nonce word ""walm,"" we need to analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs.

- In the first input, ""lug wif lug walm zup walm wif,"" the corresponding output is ""blue red blue blue blue yellow yellow yellow red."" We can see that ""walm"" occurs after both ""lug"" and ""zup,"" but before ""wif."" When ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" we have ""blue blue,"" and when it follows ""zup,"" we get ""yellow yellow.""

- In the second input, ""zup wif walm,"" the output is ""yellow red red red."" Here ""walm"" is at the end, and it results in three ""red.""

- In the third input, ""zup dax walm zup wif,"" the output is ""yellow green green green yellow red."" The ""walm"" that comes after ""dax"" translates into ""green green.""

- In the fourth input, ""zup walm lug,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow blue."" This indicates that ""walm"" after ""zup"" translates into ""yellow yellow.""

- Finally, in the fifth input, ""lug dax walm wif,"" the output is ""blue green green green red."" The ""walm"" following ""dax"" again translates into ""green green.""

From these patterns, we can deduce that ""walm"" seems to repeat the color associated with the word that precedes it two additional times.

- After ""lug"" which is ""blue,"" ""walm"" results in ""blue blue.""
- After ""zup"" which is ""yellow,"" ""walm"" results in ""yellow yellow.""
- After ""dax"" which is ""green,"" ""walm"" results in ""green green.""

The three ""red"" after ""wif walm"" might be a special case because ""wif"" is associated with ""red,"" but it's not clear why it repeats three times instead of two. However, it could be that ""walm"" at the end of a sequence implies an extra repetition of the preceding color.

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color associated with the preceding word two more times. When ""walm"" is at the end of a sequence, it repeats the color of the preceding word three times instead of two.

walm -> meaning: A repetition of the color associated with the preceding word, with potential variation at the end of a sequence.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax
Output: blue green

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Based on the examples provided, each instance of the nonce word ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue"" in the output. This is consistent across all examples, no matter the position of ""lug"" within the input sequence. Thus, the rule appears to be straightforward:

Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

The word ""dax"" consistently corresponds to the color green in every example provided.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow regardless of its position within the input sequence.
bluf -> meaning. The meaning of ""bluf"" appears to be the color ""blue,"" as consistently, when ""bluf"" is in the input, ""blue"" appears in the output. However, other words in the sequence also dictate the output color that follows them. For example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" ""wif"" corresponds to ""red,"" and ""dax"" corresponds to ""green."" When ""bluf"" is repeated, ""blue"" is also repeated. Thus, the rule is that ""bluf"" corresponds directly to the color ""blue."" 

Rule: ""bluf"" equals the color ""blue.""
Analyzing the provided input-output examples, we can see that ""walm"" causes the following pattern when used in combination with other words:

- When ""walm"" follows ""zup,"" the output is ""yellow yellow yellow.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" the output is ""green green green.""
- When ""walm"" follows ""lug wif,"" the output is ""red red red.""

The common factor here is that the color of the output is repeated three times and corresponds to the preceding word. More specifically, the word that comes immediately before ""walm"" determines the color, and that color is outputted three times. 

Hence, we can induce the following rule for ""walm"":

Rule: When used after another word, ""walm"" causes the output color to be the same color associated with that preceding word, repeated three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

"Use this grammar to parse the input example to get the correct output.

    Rules:
Rule: ""lug"" corresponds to the color ""blue.""
Observing the examples given, each instance of the nonce word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output, regardless of its position in the input sequence. 

Therefore, the rule is: dax -> green.
Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
From the examples provided, each instance of ""bluf"" in the input corresponds to a color in the output that matches the color associated with the word immediately preceding it. Therefore, we can deduce that ""bluf"" indicates repetition or duplication in terms of color association. Here is the rule based on the examples:

Rule: bluf -> Repeat the color associated with the previous word.
Observing the provided examples, we can infer a rule for the meaning of the nonce word ""walm"" based on the color outputs and their respective inputs:

1. Input: ""zup wif walm""
   Output: ""yellow red red red""
   
   Here ""zup"" correlates with the first ""yellow"", and ""wif"" correlates with the first ""red"". Since ""walm"" follows, the output repeats ""red"" three times.

2. Input: ""zup dax lug walm zup""
   Output: ""yellow green blue blue blue yellow""
   
   In this example, ""zup"", ""dax"", and ""lug"" correlate with ""yellow"", ""green"", and ""blue"", respectively. The sequence ""walm zup"" results in ""blue blue yellow"", with ""blue"" being repeated twice before ending with the color associated with ""zup"".

3. Input: ""dax wif walm""
   Output: ""green red red red""
   
   ""dax"" and ""wif"" correspond to ""green"" and ""red"", accordingly. Following the pattern, ""walm"" results in repeating ""red"" three times.

4. Input: ""zup bluf lug zup walm""
   Output: ""yellow yellow blue yellow yellow yellow""
   
   Here, ""zup"" equates to ""yellow"" and ""lug"" to ""blue"". ""Bluf"" isn't defined, but since it occurs between two instances of ""zup"" and the output between the yellows is also yellow, it suggests that ""bluf"" corresponds to ""yellow"" as well. The sequence after ""zup walm"" is a repetition of ""yellow"" three times.

5. Input: ""dax walm""
   Output: ""green green green""

   ""dax"" correlates with ""green"", followed by ""walm"" which results in ""green"" being repeated two more times.

Combining these observations, we can infer that ""walm"" represents a rule in which the last color mentioned is repeated three times. However, we notice in the second example that it's not always exactly three times; when a new distinct color word occurs after ""walm"", the three repetitions are interrupted by the color corresponding to the new word.

Based on this, the rule seems to be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the last color mentioned until either a new color word is introduced or until it has been repeated three times. If another color word immediately follows ""walm"", repeat the last mentioned color until the new color takes over.

However, there is not enough data to definitively conclude if the start of a new sequence like ""zup"" (yellow) in the presence of ""walm"" affects the sequence in any specific way beyond starting a new color.

Hence, a more conservative interpretation based on the provided examples alone would be:

Rule: ""walm"" -> repeat the last color mentioned three times, or continue repeating the last mentioned color until a new color word appears.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
Rule: dax -> green

Each instance of ""dax"" in the input corresponds to the color ""green"" in the output.
Based on the given examples, it's possible to deduce the rule for the nonce word ""wif."" Each occurrence of ""wif"" corresponds to an output of ""red"" in the sequences provided. Moreover, it appears that other words possibly correspond to specific colors: ""zup"" translates to ""yellow,"" ""dax"" to ""green,"" and ""lug"" to ""blue."" ""Walm"" also seems to be ""green,"" like ""dax,"" given the repetition in the fourth input example.

Rule: wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color yellow, regardless of its position or the context within the given input.
Based on the provided examples, it seems that ""bluf"" represents a color, but its output depends on the word that precedes it. Below are the analyzed examples and the color outputs that correspond to ""bluf"":

1. lug walm wif lug bluf -> blue blue blue red blue blue 
   (""bluf"" follows ""lug"" -> output is ""blue"")

2. dax lug bluf dax -> green blue blue green 
   (""bluf"" follows ""lug"" -> output is ""blue"")

3. dax zup lug zup bluf -> green yellow blue yellow yellow 
   (""bluf"" follows ""zup"" -> output is ""yellow"")

4. dax lug bluf wif -> green blue blue red 
   (""bluf"" follows ""lug"" -> output is ""blue"")

5. zup wif bluf -> yellow red red 
   (""bluf"" follows ""wif"" -> output is ""red"")

Based on the patterns above, it seems that ""bluf"" takes the color of the word that precedes it, with the following mappings:

- ""lug"" mapped to ""blue""
- ""zup"" mapped to ""yellow""
- ""wif"" mapped to ""red""

Therefore, the rule seems to be that ""bluf"" represents the color of the word that comes before it.

Rule: bluf -> The color output of ""bluf"" matches the color represented by the word that immediately precedes it in the sequence.
Based on the examples provided, the nonce word ""walm"" translates to a repetition of the color associated with the word that immediately precedes it. The pattern suggests that ""walm"" causes the previous color word to be output three times.

- In the first example, ""dax"" corresponds to ""green,"" and ""walm"" follows ""dax,"" resulting in ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In the second example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug"" then ""dax,"" which corresponds to ""green,"" resulting in ""blue"" repeated three times, followed by ""green"" repeated once.
- In the third example, ""lug"" corresponds to ""blue,"" and ""walm"" follows ""lug,"" then ""zup"" corresponds to ""yellow,"" followed by another ""walm."" This results in ""blue"" being repeated three times and ""yellow"" being repeated three times.
- The fourth example is the same as the first, with ""dax"" followed by ""walm,"" leading to ""green"" being repeated three times.
- In the fifth example, ""dax,"" ""wif,"" ""zup,"" and ""bluf"" each correspond to a color (""green,"" ""red,"" ""yellow,"" ""yellow""), and ""walm"" follows ""wif,"" resulting in ""red"" being output three times following the color pattern established by the preceding color words.

Based on this, we can formulate the following rule:

Rule: walm -> Repeat the color associated with the immediately preceding word three times.

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

    Rules:
Rule: lug -> blue
dax -> green

Rule: The word ""dax"" corresponds to the color ""green."" Regardless of its position in the input sequence, ""dax"" consistently translates to ""green"" in the output.
Based on the examples given, it appears that the word ""wif"" directly correlates to the output color ""red"". Each time the word ""wif"" appears in the input, the color ""red"" appears in the corresponding position in the output. There are no instances in the examples where ""wif"" is associated with any other color or output.

Therefore, the rule is:
wif -> red
zup -> yellow

Rule: The word ""zup"" corresponds to the color ""yellow"" regardless of its position in the input sequence.
bluf -> red

Rule: The word ""bluf"" translates to the color red.
To deduce the meaning of ""walm,"" let's examine the given inputs and their outputs, focusing on the occurrences of ""walm"" and the words that precede or follow it:

1. lug walm zup lug zup wif -> blue blue blue yellow blue yellow red
2. dax lug walm -> green blue blue blue
3. wif dax zup walm -> red green yellow yellow yellow
4. dax zup walm wif walm -> green yellow yellow yellow red red red
5. dax walm wif -> green green green red

By examining where ""walm"" appears and how it affects the output, we see the following:

- When ""walm"" appears after ""lug,"" the output color is blue.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""dax,"" the output color is green.
- When ""walm"" appears after ""zup"" or ""wif,"" the output color is yellow.
- When ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" an extra ""red"" is included in the output.

From these observations, the rule appears to be:

Rule: The word ""walm"" repeats the color of the word preceding it. If ""walm"" is followed by ""wif,"" an additional ""red"" is appended to the output sequence.

Therefore:
walm -> meaning. Walm repeats the color of the previous word, with an additional ""red"" if followed by ""wif"".

    However, just write the output like what's shown in these examples.
    Input: lug dax

Input: wif zup
Output: red yellow

Input: lug bluf
